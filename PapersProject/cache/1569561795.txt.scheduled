xmlabstract -> We study the problem of key-distillation for a source model, with a one-way and rate-limited public communication between two legitimate users. Although, the secret-key capacity is already known, we provide an alternative achievability scheme, that directly translates into practical designs. We consider a sequential key-distillation strategy, which consists of a reconciliation phase followed by a privacy amplification phase performed with extractors. We determine the reconciliation capacity and show that, for a degraded source, such a sequential strategy leads to an optimal key-distillation strategy that achieves the secret-key capacity. We illustrate our results in the case of a binary source model.
