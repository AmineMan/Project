parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> Missing and corrupted data are ubiquitous in many science and engineering domains. We analyze the information-theoretic limits of recovering sparse vectors under various models of corrupted and missing data. In particular, consider a high-dimensional linear regression model y = X beta* + epsilon, where y is the n-dimensional response vector, X is an nxp random design matrix with p >> n and rows distributed i.i.d. as N(0, Sigma_x), beta* is the unknown p-dimensional regression vector, and epsilon ~ N(0, sigma_epsilon^2 I) is independent additive noise. Whereas a traditional approach assumes that the covariates X are fully observed, we assume only that a corrupted version Z is observed. Our main contribution is to establish minimax rates of convergence for estimating beta* in squared l_2-loss, assuming beta* is k-sparse. Our upper and lower bounds in both additive noise and missing data cases scale as k log (p/k) / n, with prefactors depending only on the corruption and/or missing pattern of the data.
