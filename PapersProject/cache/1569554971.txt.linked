xmlabstract -> In this paper, we focus on a general coordinated multi-point (CoMP) multiple input multiple-output (MIMO) system consisting of multiple users and multiple base stations (BSs) equipped with multiple antennas, respectively. An asymptotic ergodic mutual information expression and the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for the system are derived employing novel techniques from large dimensional random matrix theory (RMT). The asymptotic regime is based on the assumption that the numbers of antennas at the transmitter and receiver approach to infinity with a fixed ratio. Our contributions are to extend the previous results to the general channel model with two-sided spatial correlation and line-of-sight (LOS), in which the transmit and receive correlation matrices are both generally nonnegative definite and the channel entries are non-Gaussian distributed. Simulations show that the asymptotic capacity is accurate even for finite number of antenna and invariant to all types of fading distribution.
