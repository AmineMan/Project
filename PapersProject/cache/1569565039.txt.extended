xmlabstract -> The girth profile is introduced and search algorithms for regular and irregular quasi-cyclic LDPC block codes with both good girth profile and good degree distribution are presented. New QC LDPC block codes of various code rates are obtained and their bit error rate performance is compared with that of the corresponding LDPC block codes defined in the IEEE 802.16 WiMAX standard of the same block length and code rate.
