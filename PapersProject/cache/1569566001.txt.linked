xmlabstract -> The Lp-constrained least squares, which is denoted by (P_c), for 0<p<1 is addressed. A maximal continuous curve of its critical solutions for different bounds c forms a critical path which can be constructed with the variational method. The path is a piecewise smooth single-valued function of c, containing non-optimal points such as saddle points and local maxima in general as well as global minima. The path of global minima may coincide with a critical path but may jump from a critical path to another one. The breakpoints of the greedy path (a critical path constructed with a certain greedy selection criterion) coincide with the step-by-step solutions generated by the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). A critical point of (P_c) is also a critical point of the Lp-penalized least squares (P_lambda) which reformulates (P_c) with the Lagrangian multiplier. The greedy path is a multi-valued function of lambda and is formed by a collection of multiple critical paths of (P_lambda).
