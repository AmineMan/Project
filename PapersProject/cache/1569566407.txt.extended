xmlabstract -> THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. In this paper, we study the capacity region of the two-user binary fading interference channel with delayed network state information at the transmitters and noiseless output feedback links from each receiver to its corresponding transmitter. Our results include a new achievability strategy that systematically utilizes the stale network state information and the previously received signals at the receivers, in order to enhance the achievable rate region. We also derive new outer-bounds on the capacity region of such network, and we show that the delay in learning network state information results in some loss in the capacity region.
