xmlabstract -> In this paper, we investigate performances of simple transmission strategies. We first consider two user SISO Gaussian symmetric interference channel (IC) for which Etkin, Tse and Wang proposed a scheme (ETW scheme) which achieves one bit gap to the capacity. We compare performance of point-to-point (p2p) codes with that of the ETW scheme in practical range of transmitter power. It turns out that p2p coding scheme performs better or as nearly good as the ETW scheme. Next, we consider K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. We define interference regimes for K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC and provide closed-form characterization of the symmetric rate achieved by the p2p scheme and the ETW scheme. Using this characterization, we evaluate performances of simple strategies with K=3, and show the similar trend to two user case.
