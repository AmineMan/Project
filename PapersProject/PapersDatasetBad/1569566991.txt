ABSTRACT
A sparse-dual-frame based 1 -analysis approach for compressed
sensing (CS) is proposed. The sparse dual frame is a notion of optimal dual frames of a non-exact frame. It is motivated in the study of
compressed sensing problems where signals are sparse with respect
to redundant dictionaries (frames). An alternating iterative algorithm
is proposed. An error bound ensuring the correct signal recovery
is obtained. Empirical studies over generally difﬁcult CS problems
demonstrate that the new sparse-dual-based approach provides satisfactory solutions, whereas other existing means may not.

The 1 -synthesis approach is still by far the most popular method
for signal recovery in related compressed sensing applications. Empirical studies also show that 1 -synthesis sometimes do achieve good
recovery results for mild problems [2, 3]. However, since D is a
highly coherent frame, all previously known sparse recovery conditions and error estimates no longer apply satisfactorily to the composite matrix AD [1], [3]. Recovery guarantee is hampered.
1 -analysis approach is an alternative that tries to ﬁnd the signal
f directly by solving the problem
min D∗ f

f ∈Hn

1. INTRODUCTION
Standard compressed sensing studies often assume signals possess
sparse (or nearly sparse) representations with respect to orthonormal
bases.
As compressed sensing takes more stage in practical applications, a growing number of problems point to scenarios where signals
are sparse with respect to redundant frames rather than orthonormal
bases. Obviously, the ﬂexibility of frames is the key characteristic
that empowers frames to become a natural and concise signal representation tool. As a result, studies on compressed sensing problems
where signals are sparse with respect to frames are becoming more
and more appealing and critical.
Let D be a dictionary/frame whose columns are the frame vectors. By f being sparse with respect to D, we mean f = Dx, and
x is the sparse coefﬁcient vector. In general compressed sensing formulation, f is often measured by a under-determined sensing matrix
A, namely,
y = Af + z = ADx + z,
(1.1)
where A ∈ Rm×n is typically known as “fat” sensing matrix with
m
n, and z ∈ Rm is a noise term. The goal of the compressed
sensing problem is to derive means to faithfully recover f , from the
compressed measurement y.
Since x is sparse, a straightforward approach is to view (1.1) as
y = (AD)x + z, and to recover the sparse coefﬁcient x by solving
the 1 -minimization problem

provided that A obeys a “D-RIP” condition [2] with a “D-RIP” constant δ2s < 0.08.
RIP (Restricted Isometry Property) and D-RIP (RIP applied to
the union of column subspaces of the dictionary/frame D) are both
popular notions in compressed sensing studies. We refer to , e.g., [2],
[4], [5], for details and further discussions.
Indeed, 1 -analysis demonstrates a promising performance in applications where both the columns of the Gram matrix D∗ D and the
coefﬁcient vector x are reasonably sparse. In other words, as long as
the frame coefﬁcient vector D∗ f is sensibly sparse, 1 -analysis is a
good approach with a nice error bound guarantee (1.4).
However, there is a unforgiven reality to the use of D∗ as the
analysis operator. In general, f is sparse in terms of D does not imply D∗ f is necessarily sparse. Indeed, when D is a Parseval frames,
D∗ f = D∗ Dx is the canonical expansion coefﬁcients of f . Canonical expansion has the minimum 2 -norm and is usually fully populated and is not sparse. This is also pointed out speciﬁcally in compressed sensing studies with frames, e.g., [3].
We propose a sparse-dual-frame based analysis approach that
takes advantage of both the sparsity of the analysis coefﬁcients, and
a similar error bound estimate as that of (1.4). Sparse dual frames
is a notion of optimal dual frames of a given (non-exact) frame that
produces sparse coefﬁcients for a given f [6]. It is speciﬁcally introduced to cope with the lack of sparsity in D∗ f in typical analysis
schemes. To provide a solution to this sparse-dual-based formulation,
an alternating iterative algorithm is developed. Some examples are
also reported.

2. SPARSE-DUAL-FRAME BASED ANALYSIS APPROACH
Let us begin with a brief discussion of the relevance between sparse
representations and a notion of sparse dual frames.
Let D be a dictionary with which a signal f has a sparse representation. D could be a basis or a redundant frame. In sparse representations, the main purpose is to ﬁnd the sparse coefﬁcient for a
given signal f , which is commonly formulated as
(P0 )

min x

x∈Hn

s.t. Dx = f,

0

where · 0 stands for the number of nonzero entries. Lead by
Donoho, Cand´ s, Tao and their associates, the renowned advances
e
in the area of sparse representations lie fundamentally in the replacement of (P0 ) with its convex relaxation
(P1 )

min x

x∈Hn

s.t. Dx = f.

1

They show that with appropriate conditions over the matrix D, the solution to (P1 ) is the same as the solution to (P0 ). There have been an
abundant articles exploring the equivalence between (P0 ) and (P1 ),
e.g., [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
In this report, D shall always stand for a (frame) matrix consisting in its columns of all vectors of a frame. D is used for a dual frame
matrix such that DD∗ = DD∗ = I, [13]. How is sparse representation related to sparse dual frames? Let us proceed with the sparse
dual discussion.
2.1. Sparse dual frames
From a frame theoretical point of view, when a signal f is sparse with
respect to a frame D, there is a sparse coefﬁcient vector x such that
f = Dx. It is not hard to imagine that there ought be an optimal
dual frame, say DS that produces the very sparse coefﬁcient x, i.e.,
x = D∗ f . After all, all coefﬁcients of a frame expansion of f ought
S
to correspond to some dual frame, which really is the spirit of frame
expansions.
We see that knowing the solution to (P0 ) or (P1 ) is equivalent to
knowing an optimal dual frame DS which is capable of producing
the very sparse coefﬁcient x by x = D∗ f .
S
We call such an optimal dual frame sparse dual frame.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let D be a frame with columns of frame elements
{xk }N of Hn . Let 0 = f ∈ Hn be sparse with respect to D such
k=1
that f = Dx, where x is a sparse vector. We say DS is a sparse dual
frame of D, if DD∗ = I and x = D∗ f .
S
S
It turns out that sparse duals DS do always exist. We have the
following theorem conﬁrming the existence of sparse duals [6].

Theorem 2.2. Let D be a frame of H . Given 0 = f ∈ H , and let
x be any coefﬁcient vector such that f = Dx. Then there must be a
dual frame Df,x such that x = D∗ f and DD∗ = I.

Remark. a. Not only sparse dual frames always exist, sparse dual
frames are not unique even for one given f . Because of the redundancy and massive freedom in the choice of W , there are common
sparse dual frames to a class of signals f .
b. Let us emphasize that the canonical dual frame is not a sparse
dual frame in general. This is because that the canonical dual frame
produces generally coefﬁcients of the least 2 -norm among all possible coefﬁcients representing a signal. And we know that 2 -norm
tends to spread the coefﬁcients into a large number of small coefﬁcients.
c. We also comment that the notion of sparse dual frames for
approximately sparse or compressible signals is an active on-going
work that we are pursuing.
There is no restriction on x in Theorem 2.2. Therefore, if x is the
sparse coefﬁcient of f , we reach the following corollary directly.
Corollary 2.3. Let D be a frame of Hn . Suppose 0 = f ∈ Hn
has a sparse frame representation f = Dx, where x is the sparse
coefﬁcient. There must be a sparse dual frame DS such that x =
D∗ f .
S
The following result indicates that though sparse duals are signal
dependent, they are nevertheless locally stable. Numerically, and in
practical applications, such a local continuity and stability of sparse
dual frames play an important role.
Theorem 2.4. Let D be a frame of Hn . Given f ∈ Hn . Suppose
D∗ f − (D∗ f )s 1 ≤ and f − g 2 ≤ δ, then

On the surface, it seems that (2.2) and (2.3) are equivalent. It is important that we outline a fundamental difference between the sparse-dual
approach (2.2) and the optimal-dual approach (2.3).
We have shown in Theorem 2 of [14], that the optimal-dual-based
analysis problem (2.3) is equivalent to the 1 synthesis approach (1.2).
Because it minimizes the 1 norm of D∗ f simultaneously over the
dual frame D and the signal f . It is important to emphasize that the
optimization in the optimal-dual approach (2.3) is entirely to minimize the 1 norm.
The sparse-dual-frame based approach is not a simultaneous 1
minimization over dual frames D and the signal f . Instead, the sparse
dual DS is theoretically optimal from the 0 point of view. Namely,
theoretically, DS is given a priori for a given (class of) f , and DS
is capable to minimize D∗ f 0 among all dual frames D. As a result, DS is different from the optimal dual Do as in (2.3), where 1
minimization is the sole concern in deriving Do .
It is true, of course, capable of minimizing the 0 measurement is
one matter, having a mean to minimize D∗ f 0 is another, which is
S
clearly combinatorial. Just as in all other sparse recovery problems,
in the end, after a sparse dual DS is given, the 1 -min is the corresponding convex relaxation, which gives rise to the sparse-dual-based
1 analysis approach (2.2).
It is also important to mention that having a sparse dual is not all
free or easy. Nevertheless, a sparse dual to a class of signals exists. It
is entirely possible to derive a sparse dual for a class of signals, and
using such a sparse dual in related signal recovery. This is an active
subsequent work we are pursuing.
Meantime, we also outlined Algorithm 1, an alternating iterative
algorithm as given in Section 2.4. At the kth iteration, an approximation fk of f is found ﬁrst, which in turn allows for an approximation
of a sparse dual Dk . This is followed by ﬁnding the next approximation fk+1 of f by the sparse-dual-based analysis problem (2.2) using
Dk . The process then iterates. As an initial effort of implementing
the sparse dual analysis approach, it is seen as effective. We refer
readers to Algorithm 1 and examples in Section 3.

Remark. In a related article also presented at ISIT 2012 [14], a notion of optimal-dual-based analysis approach is also outlined,

(2.2)

where D∗ is the analysis operator associated with sparse dual frames.
S
Since D∗ f , by deﬁnition, is much sparser than D∗ f , such an extenS
sion is clearly very natural. (2.2) is termed the sparse-dual-based
1 -analysis for compressed sensing.
There are two immediate objectives facing us. One is to establish
a similar error bound as in (1.4) for the new sparse-dual-based 1 analysis problem (2.2).
The other is to derive an algorithm for the solution of the new
sparse-dual-based approach.
Before diving into solutions to these two objectives, an important
remark is in the order.

3

Indeed, a similar error bound does hold for sparse dual frame analysis
operator DS . In fact, we have shown in [15] that sufﬁcient conditions
exist by taking any dual frame of D as the analysis operator. Error
bound is similarly derived.
Consequently, the ﬁrst objective has been achieved. One of the
main results is the following theorem. For more discussions, please
refer to [15].
Theorem 2.6. Let D = {xk }N be a frame for Hn with frame
k=1
bounds 0 < A ≤ B < ∞. Let DS be a sparse dual frame for the
˜
˜
given f with frame bounds 0 < A ≤ B < ∞. Suppose

Remark. Note that condition (2.4) is about the D-RIP constant. For
appropriately chosen a and b, (2.4) will give rise to a condition on,
say δ2s . We have shown in [15] that (2.4) provides an improvement
over the D-RIP constant in [2] for the error bound (1.4) to hold.
More importantly, the key point in Theorem 2.6 is that a similar
error bounds holds with any dual frame D (including the sparse dual
DS , of course) as the analysis operator.
The remaining issue is certainly about the determination of the
sparse dual frame DS . There are two observations to make. First
of all, suppose f = Dx is known, and x is sparse. Then x can be
determined by various algorithms. Sparse dual can then be explicitly
determined as well by the dual frame theory [13]. For details, and for
a new null space tuning algorithm we developed for the same purpose,
we refer to [16].
Secondly, in order to solve (2.2), an explicit form of the sparse
dual is not necessary as we explain next. By the dual frame theory,
see, e.g., [13],
D∗ f = D∗ (DD∗ )−1 f + (I − D∗ (DD∗ )−1 D)W ∗ f,
S
∗

where W is the free parameter matrix. Deﬁne νf := P(W f ), where
P = I − D∗ (DD∗ )−1 D is the orthogonal projection onto ker D.
Then, the sparse-dual-based 1 -analysis problem (2.2) can be rewritten as
min D∗ (DD∗ )−1 f + νf

f ∈Hn

s.t.

≤ .

(2.6)

If we simply set νf = 0, (2.6) would fundamentally reduce to the
original 1 -analysis problem (1.3) where the analysis operator is the
canonical dual frame.
The point here, of course, is that νf = 0 in order to have the
sparse coefﬁcient D∗ f . The determination/adjustment of νf is the
S
most critical part.
We comment that by adjusting on the value of νf , the determination of the sparse dual frame need not be explicit while trying to solve
the new 1 -analysis problem.
We now come to the point of introducing an alternating iterative
algorithm for the solution of the sparse-dual-based 1 -analysis formulation for compressed sensing.

Algorithm 1: Alternating iteration: sparse-dual-based approach
Input: A, D, y, s, 1 , 2 ;
Output: f , x ;
fo := 0 ;
xu := arg minx x 1 s.t.
ADx − y 2 ≤ 1 ;
fu := Dxu ;
while fu − fo 2 > 2 do
fo := fu ;
xs := arg minx x 1 s.t. Dx = fo ;
νf := xs − D∗ (DD∗ )−1 fo ;
fu :=
arg minf D∗ (DD∗ )−1 f + νf 1 s.t. Af − y 2 ≤ 1 ;
f := fu ;
x := D∗ (DD∗ )−1 fu + νf ;

The result of our new alternating iterative algorithm is demonstrated in Figure 2. The relative error of the recovered signal is
f −f 2
= 0.0083.
f 2
Figure 2(b) (and part (b) of all ﬁgures that follows) is a scatter
plot of the recovered coefﬁcients (vertical axis) vs. the exact coefﬁcients (horizontal axis). Consequently, if the recovered coefﬁcients
are exact, the scatter circles should all be on the line of y = x.
Figures 4 and 6 show the results by the standard 1 -analysis and
the 1 -synthesis approaches, respectively. The relative errors of the
1 -analysis and the 1 -synthesis methods are quite unfavorably large
at 0.6760 and 0.3792, respectively.

If f is known, there are a number of algorithms to determine the

developed a fast Null Space Tuning algorithm as well for this purpose
[16].
In practice, f is to be recovered. Introduced below is a practical
alternating iterative algorithm that solves compressed sensing problems (2.6) where signals are sparse with respect to redundant frames,
which also has an analytical error bound (2.5).
