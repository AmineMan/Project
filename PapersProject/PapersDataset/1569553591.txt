Since then, a number of papers (in particular, [10], [11],
[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]) has been devoted to various
aspects of the connection between information and work.
However, the general equivalence relation remains up to now
unproven. (Part of the problem, in our opinion, is the still
existing fuzziness of distinction between “mechanical work”
and “heat.”) Moreover, all real-life examples of getting work
from a non-equilibrium system (e.g., chemical reactions, separated electrical charges, compressed gas) by allowing it to
relax to equilibrium are based on the information contained
in one-particle distributions—as if all the particles comprising
the system were independent. To the best of our knowledge,
information stored in multi-particle distributions has never
been used to extract mechanical work.
Here we address the problem of using information contained
in two-particle correlations for converting heat into work. Our
analysis is based on two important assumptions:

Abstract—It is shown how information contained in the pairwise correlations between atoms of a gas can be used to convert
completely heat taken from a thermostat into mechanical work
in a process of relaxation of the system to its thermal equilibrium
state. Both classical correlations and quantum correlations (entanglement) are considered. The amount of heat converted into
work is proportional to the entropy defect of the initial state of the
system. The equivalence relation between information and work
is explicitly demonstrated for the case of two-particle correlations.
The amount of work obtained per particle is twice as large in
the case of entanglement as in the case of classical correlations.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The connection between work and information was ﬁrst
pointed out by Szilard[1] in his analysis of Maxwell’s demon,
and later by Landauer[2] and Bennett[3]. Using the setup
of a “thought experiment” related to Gibbs’s paradox, it
was shown[4], [5], [6] that using a system of two gases
of N molecules each, with the molecules being in different
(in general, nonorthogonal) quantum states ρ(1) and ρ(2) , it
is possible to convert completely into mechanical work an
amount of heat, taken from a thermostat, which is proportional
to the entropy defect[7] of the system
W = 2N kT I0 ,

1) Since a unitary transformation of the system’s state does
not change its entropy, it can be performed without any
energy dissipation; and
2) Since orthogonal quantum states are perfectly distinguishable, there exist partitions which are permeable for
one of such states but not for the other (a well-known
example of such “partitions” is a light polarizer).

where W is work, T the temperature of the thermostat, and
I0 the entropy defect (also called “quantum information” or
“Levitin–Holevo bound”[8], [9]) of the system per molecule,
which, in this particular case, is
I0 = − Tr ρ ln ρ +

In order to avoid getting involved in deﬁnitional
arguments—such as appear sometimes in the physics
literature—concerning the distinction between work and heat,
we shall consider an isothermal quasistatic process in which
heat is taken from a thermostat and eventually transferred to
another system in a form that is inequivocally mechanical
work—namely, the lifting of a weight.
We shall treat in separate sections the case when the
two particles are classically correlated and that dealing with
quantum correlations, and conclude with a discussion of the
overall results.

Entropy defect has the meaning of information (about the
microstate of the system) associated with the selection of a
subensemble (in this example, ρ(1) or ρ(2) ) from the total
ensemble ρ.
It was conjectured[4], [5], [6] that there exists a general
equivalence relation between information and work; namely,
that by having any information J about the state of a physical
system, it is possible, by allowing the system to relax to its
maximum-entropy state, to convert into mechanical work an
amount of heat W = kT J without any entropy increase in
the environment. (Of course, all information J is lost in the
process, since the system reaches the thermal equilibrium state
that has the same energy and volume as the initial state.)

II. T HE CASE OF CLASSICAL CORRELATIONS
Consider a gas of molecules that consist of two different
atoms, A and B. To each atom is associated a 2-dimensional
Hilbert space of states with basis vectors |0 and |1 (a
qubit[18]). The thermal equilibrium (maximum-entropy) state

1

of a gas molecule is described by a density matrix
ρ=

Note that the total energy of the system has not changed in the
process. Thus, the amount of heat converted into mechanical
work is proportional to the entropy defect of the system,

ρ1 = 2 (|00 00| + |11 11|),

(3)
(ρ1 + ρ2 ), with
2
ρ2 = 1 (|01 01| + |10 10|).

Wc = N kT Ic = kT Jc .

States ρ1 and ρ2 are orthogonal, and correspond to (classically) fully correlated atoms A and B. Each of these states has
an entropy defect (in nats) Ic = ln 2 per pair, or Jc = N ln 2
for a gas of N molecules. Note that the one-particle probabilities of states |0 and |1 of both atoms are the same in
states ρ1 and ρ2 as at equilibrium. Therefore, it is impossible
to distinguish between this state and the equilibrium state on
the basis of one-particle measurements.
Without loss of generality, assume we know that the gas
is in state ρ1 (let us call it gas 1). Let the gas occupy a
vessel of volume 2V divided by a partition into two equal parts
of volume V , each occupied by N molecules, and being in
2
thermal contact with a thermostat at temperature T . To the gas
on the right side of the partition apply a unitary transformation
U1 = IA ⊗UB , where IA is the identity operator in the Hilbert
space of A and UB the operator that interchanges states |0
and |1 of B—that is, the Pauli matrix σx . Transformation U1
converts gas 1 into a gas with density matrix ρ2 (gas 2).
Now, replace the partition by two movable semipermeable
partitions such that the partition that faces gas 1 is permeable
to gas 1 but not to gas 2, and vice versa for the other partition.
Since the total pressure of the mixed gases is larger than the
pressure of one of the gases, the two partitions will be pushed
apart—and we can use the setup shown in Fig. 1 to lift weights
m1 and m2 .

By the end of the process the entire vessel is occupied by a
mixture of gas 1 and gas 2 with density matrix ρ. The initial
information about the location of each pair of atoms, contained
in the correlation of states of the two atoms in a molecule, is
now erased, and this increase in entropy exactly compensates
for the decrease of entropy of the thermostat.
III. T HE CASE OF QUANTUM CORRELATIONS
( ENTANGLEMENT )
Consider now the case where atoms forming a molecule
are in a fully entangled state. There are four such states of
two qubits, namely, the Bell states[8] Φ+ , Φ− , Ψ+ , and Ψ− ,
deﬁned as follows
1

Φ± = √ (|00 ± |11 ), Ψ± = √ (|01 ± |10 ). (7)

These four states are orthogonal and form a basis in the 4dimensional tensor-product Hilbert space of those two atoms.
The entropy defect of the system in one of those states is
Ie = 2 ln 2 per pair, or Je = 2N ln 2 for the whole gas (as
before, we assume the gas to be ideal and the states of the
molecules, independent).
Suppose that the gas is initially in state Φ+ . Then, by use
of the same transformation U1 as in the previous section, we
can convert half of the gas molecules into state Ψ+ . Using the
same setup as in Fig. 1, we obtain work W1 = N kT ln 2; the
ﬁnal state of the gas will be a mixture

Note that states ρ(1) and ρ(2) are orthogonal, and thus perfectly distinguishable.
Employing transformation U2 and using the same setup as
before, we can now repeat the mixing procedure. This will
yield additional work W2 = N k ln 2, bringing the system to
the equilibrium state ρ = 1 (ρ(1) + ρ(2) ). Hence, the total
2
amount of heat converted into work is

Now we can use a unitary transformation U2 = UΦ ⊗ UΨ ,
where UΦ is the unitary transformation that permutes Φ+ and
Φ− in the subspace spanned by these ortogonal states, and
UΨ analogously permutes Ψ+ and Ψ− . Transformation U2
converts ρ(1) into a mixed state

Consider the moment when the right partition has advanced
to the right by a volume V1 and the left partition to the left
by a volume V2 . Gas 1 will then ﬁll the volume V + V1 and
gas 2 the volume V + V2 . Let us assume that the gases are
ideal and rareﬁed. Then the pressures of the gases to the left,
to the right, and in between the partitions are, respectively,

Since the entropy defect of the entangled states is two times
as large as that of classically correlated states, the amount of
work We is also larger than Rc by a factor of 2.

(Pm − P1 )dV2 = N kT ln 2.

IV. C ONCLUSIONS

R EFERENCES

The above results demonstrate the equivalence relation between information and work for the case when the information
is contained only in two-particle probability distributions, and
cannot be extracted from a mere one-particle distribution.
The situation with the equivalence between information and
work in general remains unclear and, in a way, paradoxical.
On one hand, many researchers are strongly convinced of it
and express it in a very ﬁrm way, e.g.,“Information has an
energetic value: It can be converted into work” (Zureck[19];
but cf. [17]). (In fact, it is not information that can be converted
into work, but heat that can be converted into work by use of
information.) On the other hand, in our opinion, one still lacks
a convincing general proof that any kind of information can
be equally successfully used to convert heat into any kind of
work, so that the general statement remains a sort of “folk
theorem.” We believe that the root of this problem is the fact
that, in spite of many unquestionable examples of “work”
known to physicists, there is no general rigorous deﬁnition
that would distinguish between these two forms of energy
transfer—heat and work.
Informally speaking, work is an “informed” transfer of
energy, i.e., a transfer such that we know exactly the change
of the state of each degree of freedom, resulting from this
transfer; while heat is energy transfered in such a way that we
have no such knowledge. From that viewpoint, the equivalence
between information and work becomes indeed a tautology.
However, a rigorous formalization of these ideas has not yet
been presented.
