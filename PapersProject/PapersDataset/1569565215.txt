to Gaussian-noise (Shannon-type) capacity formulas for coherent (homodyne and heterodyne) detection and Poisson-noise
capacity results for shot-noise-limited direct detection [4], [5].
None of these results, however, can be regarded as specifying the ultimate limit on reliable communication at optical
frequencies. What is needed for deducing the fundamental
limits on optical communication is an analog of Shannon’s
channel coding theorem—but free of unjustiﬁed structural
constraints on the transmitter and receiver—that applies to
data transmission over a quantum channel, viz., the HolevoSchumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) theorem [6], [7], [8].
The HSW theorem, along with the Yuen-Ozawa converse
[8], speciﬁes the channel capacity of a pure-loss optical
channel [1]. Even though the single-letter Holevo quantity
is an achievable rate, the receiver in general must make
joint-detection (collective) measurements over long codeword
blocks—measurements that cannot be realized by detecting
single-modulation symbols followed by classical decoding.
For the pure-loss optical channel, a coherent-state modulation
sufﬁces to attain the ultimate capacity, i.e., use of nonclassical transmitted states or entangled codewords does not
increase capacity [1]. We will use the term Holevo capacity unambiguously in this paper to refer to the single-letter
Holevo rate of the pure-loss optical channel. The squareroot-measurement, which in general is a positive operatorvalued measure (POVM), applied to a random code gives
the mathematical construct of a receiver measurement that
can achieve the Holevo capacity [7]. The key questions that
remain are how to design practical modulation formats, explicit codes (with efﬁcient encoders), and most importantly,
structured laboratory-realizable designs of Holevo-capacityachieving joint-detection receivers (JDRs).
Lloyd et al. [9] conceptualized a receiver that can attain
the Holevo capacity of any quantum channel by making a sequence of “yes/no” projective measurements on codewords of
a random codebook. However, the translation of their strategy
to a structured receiver design for the optical channel was not
clear. Sen later simpliﬁed Lloyd et al.’s proof [10], and after
this, we showed how to apply Sen’s result in order to achieve
the Holevo capacity of the pure-loss optical channel [11]. The
strategy employs a random code and a sequence of multimode phase-space displacements and quantum-non-demolition
“vacuum-or-not” measurements. In Ref. [2], one of us showed

Abstract—In the low-energy high-energy-efﬁciency regime of
classical optical communications—relevant to deep-space optical
channels—there is a big gap between reliable communication
rates achievable via conventional optical receivers and the ultimate (Holevo) capacity. Achieving the Holevo capacity requires
not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collective
measurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and
it is impossible to implement these collective measurements
via symbol-by-symbol detection along with classical postprocessing [1], [2]. Here, we apply our recent results on the classicalquantum polar code [3]—the ﬁrst near-explicit, linear, symmetricHolevo-rate achieving code—to the lossy optical channel, and
we show that it almost closes the entire gap to the Holevo
capacity in the low photon number regime. In contrast, Arikan’s
original polar codes, applied to the DMC induced by the physical
optical channel paired with any conceivable structured optical
receiver (including optical homodyne, heterodyne, or directdetection) fails to achieve the ultimate Holevo limit to channel
capacity. However, our polar code construction (which uses the
quantum ﬁdelity as a channel parameter rather than the classical
Bhattacharyya quantity to choose the “good channels” in the
polar-code construction), paired with a quantum successivecancellation receiver—which involves a sequence of collective
non-destructive binary projective measurements on the joint
quantum state of the received codeword waveform—can attain
the Holevo limit, and can hence in principle achieve higher
rates than Arikan’s polar code and decoder directly applied
to the optical channel. However, even a theoretical recipe for
construction of an optical realization of the quantum successivecancellation receiver remains an open question.

Determining the ultimate limits on optical communication
must involve an explicitly quantum analysis, because electromagnetic waves are fundamentally quantum mechanical and
high-sensitivity photodetection systems are limited by noise
of quantum-mechanical origin. In quantum mechanics, the
state of a physical system together with a description of the
measurement made on that system determine the statistics
of the measurement outcomes. Thus, in seeking the classical information capacity of an optical channel, we must
allow for optimization over both the transmitted quantum
states and the receiver’s quantum measurement. In particular,
it seems inappropriate to restrict consideration to coherentstate (laser) transmitters and coherent-detection or directdetection receivers. Imposing these structural constraints leads

some of the ﬁrst examples of structured optical JDRs for
BPSK modulated binary codes, which induce superchannels
over a codebook whose Shannon capacity per symbol is
higher than the Shannon capacity of the single-use DMC
induced by an optimal measurement on each received BPSK
symbol [12]. In recent work, we generalized Arikan’s polar
code for the classical channel, to the classical-quantum (cq)
polar code that can achieve the symmetric Holevo information
for sending classical information over any quantum channel,
i.e., the Holevo information rate when the input symbols are
assigned equal priors [3]. This was the ﬁrst explicit (and linear)
code that provably achieves the Holevo capacity, and a careful
inspection of [3] reveals that this extension was non-trivial.
In this paper, we bring together our works from Refs. [2], [3]
to show that a cq-polar code essentially achieves the Holevo
capacity of the optical channel with BPSK modulation. We
show that at low mean pulse energy (photon number), this capacity is extremely close to the ultimate Holevo capacity (that
with an unrestricted modulation). The receiver for our polar
code is a quantum-limited successive-cancellation (SC) JDR
that detects and decodes successively, while acting on the entire N -BPSK-symbol optical codeword waveform. It performs
N R binary-outcome, quantum-non-demolition measurements
(as opposed to the 2N R measurement stages in [9], [11]),
decoding one message bit at a time. The ﬁnal piece of the
puzzle, a structured optical receiver design that implements our
quantum SC decoder, remains a subject of ongoing research.

Pe,hom = erfc 2E /2. Using either the Dolinar receiver or
the homodyne receiver on the BPSK pulses induces a binary
symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover probabilities Pe,min
and Pe,hom , thus attaining channel capacities,3 C1 (E) =
1 − H2 (Pe,min ) and Chom (E) = 1 − H2 (Pe,hom ) bits/symbol,
respectively, where H2 (·) is the binary entropy function. Another strategy is to use the Kennedy receiver, which coherently

shifts the BPSK constellation to |2 E , | 0 , followed by
direct detection (Poisson statistics). This induces a Z-channel
with crossover probability e−4E and with Pe,Ken = e−4E /2.

I. C APACITY OF THE PURE - LOSS OPTICAL CHANNEL
Consider a lossy optical channel with transmissivity η ∈
(0, 1]. Each channel use is a T -sec-long pulse slot that
can transmit one modulation symbol. The mean energy1 per
transmitted pulse is constrained to E photons per channel
use. The Holevo capacity of this channel is given by g(ηE)
bits/use, where g(x) = (1 + x) log(1 + x) − x log x. A
photons/sec-unit laser pulse s(t)ej(ω0 +θ)t , t ∈ [0, T ) has
T
energy Es = 0 |s(t)|2 dt photons. Quantum-mechanically,
the
√ state of this pulse is a coherent state |α , with α =
Es ejθ , where θ is taken w.r.t. some carrier-phase reference.2
Since the channel preserves coherent states (with amplitude
√
attenuation), |α → | ηα , let us assume WLOG that η = 1
(or, equivalently, treat E as the average received energy
per pulse). The capacity-achieving input distribution is the
2
isotropic Gaussian distribution p(α) = e−|α| /E /πE, and the
ultimate Holevo capacity, Cult (E) = g(E) bits/symbol.
Let us consider an equi-prior (received) BPSK alphabet
√
√
| E , | − E . The minimum average probability of error
in discriminating the two BPSK pulses is given by Pe,min =

F (W ) ≡ | ψ0 |ψ1 |2 = e−4E ,

(1)

and the symmetric Holevo information4 I(W ) ≡ H(ρ),
with ρ ≡ 1/2(|ψ0 ψ0 | + |ψ1 ψ1 |), where the von Neumann
entropy H(σ) ≡ −Tr{σ log2 σ}. The ultimate capacity achievable by the binary ensemble |ψx , x ∈ {0, 1}, is given by the
Holevo information of the average state ρp ≡ p|ψ0 ψ0 | +
(1 − p)|ψ1 ψ1 | maximized over the prior p ∈ [0, 1], i.e., C =
maxp H(ρp ). The maximum for BPSK encoding is attained at
p = 1/2. Therefore, the symmetric Holevo information is the
Holevo capacity, I(W ) = H2 1 + F (W ) /2 . Thus, for
the BPSK alphabet, the Holevo capacity is given by:
C∞ (E) = H2 1 + e−2E /2 ,

(2)

where the subscript (∞) signiﬁes that in order to achieve this
capacity, the receiver must make collective measurements over
long codeword blocks of an optimal binary code.

1 In

this paper, we will use the term “energy” to mean photon number.
We are implicitly assuming a quasi-monochromatic light source with center
frequency ω0 , for which mean photon number is indeed proportional to energy
(with a proportionality factor of ω0 ).
2 A general pure state of the temporal mode s(t) is a unit-norm vector
P
|ψ = ∞ cn |n ∈ H, where {|n } are quantum photon-number (Fock)
n=0
states, which form a complete orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space H. For
√
2
a laser pulse, cn = αn e−|α| /2 / n! (photon number is Poisson-distributed
with mean |α|2 ), and |ψ in turn is the “coherent state” |α .

3 The subscript “1” in C (E) signiﬁes that it is the highest capacity
1
achievable using a single-symbol detection, for the BPSK alphabet.
4 The Holevo information reduces to the von Neumann entropy for a purestate ensemble. More generally, if the channel outputs are mixed states ρ0
‚√ √ ‚
and ρ1 , the ﬁdelity is deﬁned as F (W ) ≡ ‚ ρ0 ρ1 ‚2 , and the symmetric
1
Holevo information as I(W ) ≡ H((ρ0 + ρ1 )/2) − H(ρ0 )/2 − H(ρ1 )/2.

It is well-known that for E
1, a coherent-state modulation along with standard (symbol-by-symbol) heterodyne
detection asymptotically achieves the ultimate Holevo capacity
g(E) bits/symbol [1], and that the capacity gap between
conventional single-symbol receivers and the Holevo limit is
the highest at low photon numbers (E
1) [2]. Hence,
for the rest of this paper, we will focus on this E
1
regime. The energy efﬁciency C1 (E)/E (bits/photon) of the
BPSK channel, when the best single-symbol detection is used
on each channel output symbol, caps off at 2 nats/photon
(2.89 bits/photon) as E → 0. On the other hand, the Holevo
limit to the energy efﬁciency of BPSK, limE→0 C∞ (E)/E =
− ln E + 1 + E ln E + [· · · ] nats/photon [13] (where [· · · ]
indicates higher order terms), not only goes to inﬁnity as
E → 0, but also approaches the ultimate (unrestrictedmodulation) Holevo limit g(E)/E asymptotically (see Fig. 1).
The highest capacity (thus energy efﬁciency) with a BPSK
modulation using a conventional receiver is achieved by ideal
homodyne detection (see green plot in Fig. 1). Even though
intensity modulation formats can attain an unbounded energy
efﬁciency using a direct detection receiver, at low E (we will
come back to this in Section II-1), at E
1, a BPSK code—
along with a JDR—is capable of practically closing the gap all
the way to the ultimate limit to capacity (which is not possible
by an intensity-only modulation).
So, how do we understand this huge gap between the best
single-symbol Shannon capacity and the Holevo capacity of
the BPSK alphabet (gap shown by the arrow in Fig. 1)? The
√
√
two coherent states {| E , | − E } are non-orthogonal (and
thus not distinguishable), with inner product e−2E > 0 as in
(1). However, by virtue of the HSW theorem [6], the joint
quantum states of well-chosen (i.i.d. random) 2N R sequences
of these two states (codeword waveforms) become nearly
perfectly distinguishable as N → ∞ as long as R < C∞ (E).
Since these codeword states live in the N -symbol Hilbert space
H⊗N , a collective measurement is required to discriminate
these states at a vanishingly low error rate. If the best singlesymbol detection is used to detect each output BPSK symbol
(thereby inducing a BSC and we stress that this is the
case with Arikan’s polar encoding and classical successive
cancellation decoder applied to the optical channel), then an
ML decoding can map the output classical sequence of these
N binary-outcome measurements to the correct codeword with
a vanishingly low probability of error, however only as long
as R < C1 (E) (i.e., it can sustain a lower capacity). Classical
information theory works with the classical-input to classicaloutput “channel”, which is determined by the combination
of the physical transmission medium and the choice of the
receiver measurement. Quantum information theory, in this
case the HSW theorem, provides us with a tool to evaluate
the best achievable capacity by automatically optimizing over
all physically-realizable receiver measurements.
Unfortunately however, just like Shannon theory, the HSW
theorem neither gives us a prescription to construct good
low-complexity codes nor does it tell us how to realize
the capacity-achieving receiver. In Section II, we provide

the ﬁrst explicit code (and a sequential-decoding collective
measurement) that can achieve the BPSK Holevo capacity, the
classical-quantum polar code.
II. ACHIEVING THE H OLEVO CAPACITY OF THE BINARY
PURE - STATE QUANTUM CHANNEL USING A POLAR CODE
We now demonstrate how to construct a polar code for
the binary pure-state channel (a special case being the BPSK
optical channel), by appealing to our recent results on cq-polar
codes for sending classical data over a quantum channel. These
codes achieve the symmetric Holevo information rate for a
general (potentially mixed-state) binary input alphabet [3].
Consider the binary pure-state classical-quantum channel
W : x → |ψx , x ∈ {0, 1}. Channels with ﬁdelity F (W ) ≤
are nearly noiseless and those with F (W ) ≥ 1 − are near to
being completely useless. Recall that the quantum ﬁdelity is
a generalization of the classical Bhattacharya distance Z [14],
[3]. Let us consider N = 2n copies of W , such that the
resulting channel is of the form: xN ≡ x1 · · · xN → |ψxN ≡
|ψx1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ |ψxN , where xN is the length N input and
|ψxN is the output state. We can extend Arikan’s idea of
channel combining [14] to this classical-quantum channel, by
considering the channels induced by a transformation on an
input bit (row) vector uN → |ψuN GN , where GN = BN F ⊗n ,
with BN being a permutation matrix that reverses the order
1 0
of the bits and F =
. This encoding is equivalent to a
1 1
network of classical CNOT gates and permutations that can be
implemented with complexity O(N log N ). See Fig. 2 for the
ﬁrst and second instances of this encoding. Further instances
are constructed recursively. We then deﬁne “split channels”
from the above combined channels as:

we can readily see that

The interpretation of this channel is that it is the one “seen”
by the bit ui if all the previous bits ui−1 are available and
1
if all the future bits uN as randomized. This motivates the
i+1
development of a quantum successive cancellation decoder [3]
that tries to distinguish ui = 0 from ui = 1 by adaptively
exploiting the results of past measurements and HelstromHolevo measurements [15], [16] for each bit decision.
Arikan’s polar coding rule divides the channels into “good”
ones and “bad” ones [14]. Let [N ] ≡ {1, . . . , N } and 0 < β <
1/2. The polar coding rule for the classical-quantum channel
divides the channels as follows:

nβ
β > 1/2, limn→∞ Pr{Xn > 2−2 } = 0.
The channel combining and splitting mentioned above can
be considered as a random birth process in which a channel
Wn+1 is constructed from two copies of a previous one Wn
according to the rules in Section 4 of Ref. [3]. One can then
consider the process {Fn : n ≥ 0} ≡ { F (Wn ) : n ≥ 0}
and prove that it is a bounded super-martingale by exploiting
the relationships given in Proposition 10 of Ref. [3]. From
the convergence properties of martingales, it follows that
F∞ converges almost surely to a value in {0, 1}, and the
probability that it equals zero is equal to the symmetric
Holevo information I(W ). Furthermore, since the process Fn
satisﬁes the relations in (7-8), the following proposition on the
convergence rate of polarization holds:
Theorem 2: Given a binary input classical-quantum channel
nβ
W and any β < 1/2, limn→∞ Pr{Fn < 2−2 } = I(W ).
One of our important advances in Ref. [3] was to establish that a quantum successive cancellation decoder performs
well for polar coding over classical-quantum channels with
(i)
equiprobable inputs. Corresponding to the split channels WN
in (3) are the following projectors that attempt to decide

so that the channels in A are the good ones and those in Ac
are the bad ones. Observe that the quantum polar coding rule
involves the quantum ﬁdelity parameter F (·), rather than a
classical one such as the Bhattacharya distance.
The following theorem is helpful in determining what
fraction of the channels become good or bad [17]:

III. D ISCUSSIONS AND C ONCLUSION
Our polar code and decoder construction in Ref. [3] offers
the ﬁrst near-explicit construction that almost closes the gap
to the Holevo capacity limit for low-photon-number (high
photon-efﬁciency) optical communications. Our construction
improves upon earlier schemes by providing an explicit linear
code with an efﬁcient encoder (as opposed to a random code),
while exponentially reducing the number of decoding steps
(N R steps as opposed to the 2N R in Refs. [9], [11]).
Several practical questions remain unanswered, the most
important one perhaps being an explicit design of our polardecoding receiver, i.e., an optical circuit involving beamsplitters, phase-shifters, squeezers, and potentially one third-order
Hamiltonian such as a Kerr interaction. In order to make
this scheme practical, ﬁnding efﬁcient means to compute the
rate matched cq polar codes for quantum channels would be
necessary. Finally, it would be interesting to ﬁnd an efﬁcient
classical-quantum polar coding scheme that can handle nonuniform input priors (viz., to achieve the Holevo limit of the
OOK modulation alphabet).

We proved the above bound on the performance of our
SC decoder by exploiting Sen’s “non-commutative union
bound” [10] and Lemma 3.2 of Ref. [18] (which upper bounds
the probability of error in a binary quantum hypothesis test by
the ﬁdelity between the test states). The bound holds under the
assumption that the sender chooses the information bits UA
from a uniform distribution. Thus, by choosing the channels
over which the sender transmits the information bits to be in A
and those over which she transmits agreed-upon frozen bits to
be in Ac , we obtain the following bound on the probability of
decoding error, as long as the code rate R = K/N < I(W ):
β

Pr{UA = UA } = o(2− 2 N ). This completes the speciﬁcation
of a cq polar code.
1) Polar codes for q-ary input channels: The binary on-off
√
keying (OOK) alphabet |0 , | E0 with priors (1 − p∗ , p∗ ),
E = p∗ E0 , with optimal p∗ (E) ≈ −E ln E/3, E
1, along
with a (symbol-by-symbol) direct detection (DD) receiver,
attains a photon efﬁciency COOK−DD (E)/E = − ln E −
ln ln(1/E) + [· · ·] nats/photon [13] (magenta solid plot in
Fig. 1). Furthermore, the Holevo capacity of the OOK alphabet
is attained by p∗ (E) ≈ E/2, and the photon efﬁciency is
√
given by COOK−Holevo (E)/E = − ln E + 1 + 2E 1/2 ln E +
[· · ·] nats/photon (solid red plot in Fig. 1). At E
1, a qary PPM constellation (which can be seen as a rate-(log2 q)/q
code over an underlying OOK alphabet) achieves a Shannon
capacity (with DD) and a Holevo capacity, which are both
extremely close to the respective unrestricted OOK capacities
(dashed magenta and red plots in Fig. 1) respectively.
The q-ary PPM constellation achieves its capacity (both
DD-Shannon and Holevo) for a uniform prior over its q
inputs, forming a q-ary input classical-quantum channel. If q
is a power of two, then a polar coding strategy to achieve
the Holevo limit of PPM is straightforward, following the
strategy to polar code for a uniform-input q-ary classical
DMC (which can in turn achieve the PPM-DD capacity) [19].
Suppose that m ≡ log2 (q). Then one can decompose the
input variable X as an m-fold Cartesian product of binary
variables (X1 , . . . , Xm ) and exploit a polar code for each
of these variables. One ﬁrst exploits a quantum successive
cancellation (SC) decoder to decode the variable X1 under the
assumption that the other variables X2 , . . . , Xm are chosen
uniformly at random (and thus are independent) for this ﬁrst
step. This decoding achieves a low probability of error as long
as the indices for the information bits are chosen according
to the polar coding rule for this ﬁrst induced channel. After
decoding X1 , the quantum measurement could potentially
disturb the state at the channel output, but this disturbance
will be asymptotically small if the measurement successfully
decodes (a result known as the Gentle Measurement Lemma
[20]). Then, X1 is available as side information for decoding
the next variable X2 , and the procedure extends iteratively
by decoding the current variable Xi with the previous i ones
available as side information and randomizing over the future
m − i variables. The rate achieved with this scheme is equal
to the symmetric Holevo capacity, by exploiting the chain rule
m
i−1
and independence: I(X1 · · · Xm ; B) = i=1 I(Xi ; BX1 ).
