Abstract—In this paper, we propose a class of full diversity rate
one space-time block codes (STBC) satisfying the generalized
orthogonal constraint (GOC). First an explicit construction of
completely decoupled STBC is proposed to obtain a rate one
STBC with linear decoding complexity for any number of
transmit antennas. Then we propose an adaptation strategy for
the codes to achieve full diversity by utilizing partial phase
information of the channel obtained via a feedback link. With a
few feedback bits, the proposed rate one code has full diversity
while reserving the same decoding complexity as Orthogonal
STBCs. Moreover, the full diversity can be still achieved even
if the simple zero-forced decoding is used at the receiver.

Albeit many advantages above-mentioned, a biggest problem
is that the code rate is impossible more than one under such
restricted conditions i) and ii) when complex constellations
and more than two transmit antennas are used. Then, in openloop systems, there does not exist such a code which has all
the good features like OSTBC and also obtain rate one for
any number of transmit antennas.
In the case of that partial channel state information (CSI)
is available at the transmitter, some eﬀective transmission
schemes in [4-7], which may perform single complex (or
real) symbol decoding, are introduced recently. Several weight
vector books designs are presented in [4] and [5] for beamforming systems by using quantized feedback to obtain the
beneﬁt of array gain, which have rate one but do not consider
the diversity order. An OSTBC based on unitary precoding
is given in [6] to provide both array gain and full diversity,
but rate one may not be assured in any number of transmit
antennas. In addition, a partly orthogonal design (POD) in
[7] is introduced to maximize the received signal to noise
ratio (SNR) and also obtain full diversity. However, the full
diversity may not be guaranteed when ZF decoding is used at
the receiver. In summary, those closed-loop schemes in [4-7]
do not obtain all the above-mentioned advantages of OSTBC
and at the same time have rate one for any number of transmit
antennas yet.
In this paper, ﬁrst an explicit construction of STBC which
satisﬁes just GOC condition is given, where rate 1 is obtained
for any number of transmit antennas due to relaxing the condition i). Then we propose an adaptation strategy to achieve full
diversity by using a few bits feedback for the constructed rate
1 code, which retains comparable ML decoding complexity
with OSTBCs. At the same time, the proposed adaptive code
does not lose full diversity when ZF decoding is used at the
receiver. This idea is inspired by the work by R. Calderbank
to use partial CSI to choose the higher diversity codes from
a codebook through limited feedback [8], which is also a full
diversity code under ZF decoding. But the numerical results
show that our code outperforms the adaptive code in [8].

I. Introduction
Multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technology is
an attractive transmission strategy since it oﬀers signiﬁcant
increase in channel capacity and communication reliability
without requiring additional bandwidth or transmission power.
Space-time coding is an eﬀective way to explore the potential
provided by the MIMO channels. Orthogonal space-time block
codes (OSTBC) [1] provide a promising transmission scheme
due to the full diversity and linear decoding complexity.
Let us consider a linear STBC given by
C=

K
k=1

sk Ak

(1)

where sk , k = 1, 2, ..., K, are K real information symbols,
which are usually the components of symbols from any
complex constellations, and (A1 , A2 , ..., AK ) is a set of T × NT
complex matrices called dispersion matrices. A set of suﬃcient
and necessary conditions for C to be an OSTBC [1] or a socalled unrestricted full-rank single-symbol decodable design
[2] is listed below:
H
i) Ak Ak is full-rank for all 1 ≤ k ≤ K;
H
(2)
ii) Am Al + AlH Am = 0, where 1 ≤ m l ≤ K.
The condition ii) is named as “generalized orthogonal constraint (GOC)” in [3], which is equivalent to a condition that
all the symbols s1 , s2 , ..., sK can be decoupled completely. As
we know, satisfying both conditions i) and ii) is suﬃcient
for a STBC to obtain full diversity without any constellation restriction [2], and meanwhile to employ individual real
symbol maximum-likelyhood (ML) decoding. Moreover, such
codes (like OSTBCs) can still achieve full diversity even if the
simple zero-forced (ZF) decoding is used due to orthogonality.

III. Construction of Completely Decoupled STBC
In this section, we give an explicit construction of completely decoupled rate one STBC. That is to satisfy GOC and
obtain rate one at the same time.
Theorem 1: Consider a 2 × 2 OSTBC which consists of the
following four dispersion matrices
E1 =

where r = D−1 H y is a new K × 1 received vector obtained
after match ﬁltering; w = D−1 H T n is K × 1 noise vector
and the entries of w are i.i.d. variable with distribution
CN(0, 1/2). The resulting equivalent channel for each element
of s1 , s2 ,√ sK is then a single-input-single-output (SISO)
...,
channel dk , k = 1, 2, ..., K. So the symbols can be decoded
individually if they are independent to each other. In addition,
due to the columns orthogonality of H , the ZF decoding is
always equivalent to ML decoding [10].

In the sequel, we construct Γm , m = 1, ..., M, to satisfy
the above conditions. From (12), the columns in Γm are
orthogonal to the columns in Γn , m

locate diﬀerent orthogonal subspaces of C M×1 . Therefore, we
present a construction of Γm , m = 1, ..., M, as explained below.

bases of C M×1 . Assuming Υ = [γ1 , γ2 , ..., γ M ], where γm ,

a) All the entries of have the magnitude 1;
b) ΥΥH = M · I M×M .
Then, the Γm , m = 1, ..., M, can be constructed as
Γm = ηm ηm ... ηm · diag(γm ), m = 1, ..., M

To resolve the problem, our adaptive strategy is to adjust
the K equivalent SISO channels to be close to h F as possible
by a few feedback bits. The explicit introduction is:
H
According to (16), the Agm Agm , m = 1, ..., M , g = 1, ..., 4
have only M diﬀerent patterns, then from (8) we know the
ˆ
d1 ∼ dK have M distinct values, which are labeled with dm :

(14)
(15)

Proof : First, we prove the above Γm , m = 1, ..., M, in
(15) satisfy the condition in (12). The (15) is equivalent to
say that the columns vectors within Γm belong to the same
subspace with only base ηm . Since η1 , η2 , ..., η M are mutually
orthogonal, the Γm , where m = 1, ..., M, satisfy (12) obviously.
Generally, ηm , m = 1, ..., M, are recommended to be chosen as
normal orthogonal bases with decentralized power distribution.
Second, we give an explanation as follows about why we
constrain Υ with the two conditions a) and b).
According to (11) and (13), we can get

ˆ
dm = hH Agm Agm h, m = 1, ..., M

and each of dm repeats 4 times in [d1 , d2 , ..., dK ], K = 4M.
Design an adaptive γm as follows:

γm = diag e jθ0 e jθ1 e jθ2 ... e jθM−1 γm , m = 1, ..., M

where m = 1, ..., M and Ξ is a M × M matrix with all entries

as hm = [h2m−1 h2m ]T , m = 1, ..., M. After some simpliﬁcations
ˆ
and combining with (20), dm can be further derived as below

(17)

At the same time, from (15) we have
H
Γm Γm = (diag(γm ))H Ξ (diag(γm ))

(20)

where θ0 = 0 , and θ1 , θ2 , ..., θ M−1 are a set of phase control
factors which are fed back from receiver to transmitter. Obviously, the γm also satisfy the statements in Theorem 2. By
ˆ
ˆ
replacing γm with γm and combining (16), (18) and (19), dm
ˆ
can be rewritten as

where m = 1, ..., M, g = 1, ..., 4, and K = 4M. Then, combining
(4), (16) and NT = 2M, the following energy constrain of Γm
is obtained as

let all the entries of Υ have the magnitude 1. The constraint

IV. Adaptive Strategy to Obtain Full Diversity

θ1 , θ2 , ..., θ M−1 = Arg min |Re (ξm )| , m = 1, ..., M

In this section, we propose an adaptive strategy for the
rate one STBC with GOC proposed in section III to achieve
full diversity at the expense of limited feedback information,
while preserving the same decoding complexity. Without loss
Δ
of generality, we assume NR = 1 and H = hNT ×1 .
First, let we analyze the equivalent channel property of
OSTBCs, which are the only codes satisfying GOC and full
diversity. For an OSTBC, all Ak , k = 1, 2, ..., K, are unitary,
so that we can get dk = h 2 from (8). Then, the model
F
(10) can be rewritten as rk = ρ/NT h F sk + wk , where
k = 1, 2, ..., K. When the channels h1 h2 ... hNT will not deeply
fade simultaneously, the equivalent SISO channel h F will not
be zero, then the signals sk , k = 1, 2, ..., K, can be theoretically
recovered in the receiver. As a result, the NT orders transmit
diversity is obtained.
Then, let we consider the equivalent SISO channel of the
above constructed rate one STBC with GOC. We still rewrite
√
the (10) to rk = ρ/NT dk sk + wk , where k = 1, 2, ..., K. As
the weight matrices are not of full rank, we know from (8)
√
that dk may be zero even if h1 , h2 , ..., hNT will not deeply fade
simultaneously. This is the main diﬀerence between OSTBCs
and the constructed code and is also the reason why the
constructed code has not full diversity.

due to (22).
which is equivalent to minimize dm − h
On the other hand, we hope that the determinant of the
equivalent channel matrix D in (10), which also aﬀects the
coding performance [8], can be maximized.
From (14) we know that the rows in Υ are orthogonal to
M
∗
each other, thus m=1 γlm γim = 0 , i l . Combining (14), (22)
and (23), it is easy to ﬁnd the following equation holds

Then, the product m=1 dm reaches the maximum when dm =

det DH D . So, (24) is also equivalent to maximize det DH D .
Finally, two examples are given about the adaptive strategy.

A. Nt=4
In a system with four transmit antennas, we let γ1 = [1 1]T ,
γ2 = [1 − 1]T and
γm = diag([1 e jθ ])γm , m = 1, 2

According to (23) we can obtain

V. Numerical Results

proposed adaptive codes with GOC, which is labeled with
abbreviation “A-GOC”. All the simulations are considered
assuming one receive antenna for simplicity.

In general, θ is quantized with log2 (Q) bits as

feedback for both NT = 4 and 6. Just 2∼6 feedback bits used
in the proposed adaptive code can already guarantee Λmin is a
positive constant so that full diversity is obtained.

B. Simulation for Verifying Full Diversity
To verify that the proposed codes obtain full diversity with
limited feedback, we refer to the performance of the fourgroup decodable STBC (4Gp-STBC) introduced in [11], which
is a full diversity code with the lowest decoding complexity
among the known rate-one codes for open-loop systems.
The performance of A-GOC through diﬀerent number of
feedback bits are shown in Fig. 2 for both four and six transmit
antennas. The A-GOC uses 4QAM constellation and performs
single-real-symbol ML decoding (labelled with SRSD) for
NT = 4 . For verifying the equivalence of ZF and ML
decoding, the A-GOC is decoded with both SRSD and ZF
in the system of NT = 6 , where 16QAM constellation is
used. Correspondingly, the 4Gp-STBCs also use 4QAM and
16QAM constellation, respectively, for NT = 4 and NT = 6 ;
double and triple real symbols are employed to jointly decode,
respectively, for NT = 4 and NT = 6. It is easy to see that
when NT = 4, the A-GOC with only two feedback bits obtains

(34)

It is necessary to note that the equality in (30) will not be
satisﬁed when the length of |δ1 | , |δ2 | and |δ3 | cannot compose
a triangle. In this case, we let δ1 e jθ1 + δ∗ e− jθ2 + δ3 e j(θ2 −θ1 ) be
2
minimized by constraining the boundary conditions in (33) and
(34). In practical engineering, for avoiding calculating inverse
cosine and argument of complex numbers, the following
searching method is recommended if the number of quantized
bits is very small, as

When NT = 6, it is shown that 4 feedback bits can improve
performance by about 1.2 dB compared with that of the 4GpSTBC. We also see that ZF decoding is always equivalent
to ML decoding for A-GOC. In summary, with the expense
of a few feedback bits, the A-GOC obtains full diversity and
preserves linear decoding complexity and equivalence of ZF
to ML.

C. A-GOC Versus Adaptive QSTBC [8]
Recently, an adaptive Quasi-orthogonal STBC (labelled with
A-QSTBC) with angle feedback was introduced in [8] to
achieve full diversity but just using a simple ZF receiver for
four transmit antennas. Compared with the performance of
A-QSTBC with optimal feedback angle, we present the performance of A-GOC with 2 bits, 3 bits and optimal feedback
angle in Fig. 3. The optimal feedback angle for A-QSTBC
ˆ
is chosen as θ = ∠(h2 h∗ /h1 h∗ ) assuming the availability of
3
4
suﬃcient feedback bits, which is described in [8]. All of
the results are simulated with 4QAM constellation and ZF
decoding. It can be seen that the A-GOC with just 2 feedback
bits has slightly better performance than that of the A-QSTBC
with optimal feedback. Furthermore, the gain increases to
about 1 dB when 3 feedback bits is used.
VI. Conclusions
In this paper, we give a construction of the rate one
and full decoupled STBC. Based on the construction, an
adaptive coding strategy is proposed to obtain full diversity
under low-rate feedback. Basically, with the expense of a
few bits feedback, the proposed rate one code obtains all the
advantages of OSTBC, such as, having full diversity without
any constellation restriction, performing linear ML decoding
complexity, the simple ZF decoding reserving the equivalent
