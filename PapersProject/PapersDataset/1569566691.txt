Abstract—A new communication scheme for Gaussian diamond relay networks based on superposition coding and partial
decoding at the relays is presented. A ﬁrst level codebook is
constructed with symbols chosen from a binary alphabet while
a second level codebook is composed of codewords chosen with
Gaussian symbols. The relays partially decode the message to
identify when to amplify the incoming signals. The new communication scheme is a generalization of decode-and-forward, amplifyand-forward, and bursty-amplify-and-forward. The achievable
rates are studied in the asymptotic low SNR regime. It is shown
that the new scheme outperforms all previously known schemes
for some channels and parameter ranges.

been studied in [6] for low SNR via a minimum energy-per-bit
formulation. This work also establishes a relationship between
the minimum energy-per-bit and capacity, and characterizes
the minimum energy-per-bit within a constant factor. The
slow-fading Gaussian relay channel at low SNR has been
studied in [7] for low outage probability, where it is shown
that the BAF scheme (see below) is optimal and achieves the
outage capacity for certain parameter ranges.
We propose a new communication scheme tailored to
the low SNR regime which we denote binary-superpositionpartially-decode-and-forward (BSPDF). We generate a binary
codebook (i.e. with symbols chosen from {0, 1}) of sparse
binary patterns, and encode part of the source message through
the selection of a codeword from this codebook. The remaining
part of the source message is encoded through an independent
codeword with Gaussian symbols, transmitted in the symbol
positions where the binary codeword has ones. The relays then
decode the binary codeword and amplify the received signal
only in the time indices where the binary codeword has ones.
Finally the destination jointly decodes both codewords. We observe that BSPDF leverages the beneﬁts of BAF of increasing
the symbol SNR to avoid excessive noise ampliﬁcation, while
achieving a larger rate by conveying information through the
binary codeword.
We characterize the rates that can be achieved with the
BSPDF scheme, and analyze its performance in the asymptotic
regime of SNR→ 0 for symmetric diamond networks. Our
results show that our new communication scheme matches or
exceeds the performance of all previously known communication schemes in this asymptotic regime. We use the achievable
rate of BSPDF at low SNR to compute an upper bound on the
minimum energy-per-bit for the symmetric diamond network.
We show that the worst-case ratio of this upper bound to the
cut-set lower bound on the energy-per-bit is 1.87, improving
on the worst case ratios obtained with DF and BAF, which are
2 and 2.85 respectively.
While not explicitly discussed in this paper, it is possible
to improve the performance of other communication schemes
(e.g. CF, partial-decode-and-forward, etc.) by combining them
with the underlying ideas of BSPDF, i.e. increasing the symbol
SNR by communicating with small-duty-cycle signals and
encoding additional information in the binary codeword.
Regarding notation, an n-vector (x 1 , . . . , xn ) is written as

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cooperation in wireless networks is often modeled through
relay networks. In these models one or more source nodes
communicate with one or more destination nodes with the
help of intermediate relay nodes. Relay network models are
of relevance in wireless sensor networks where the sensor
nodes have limited transmission power capabilities and communication range. In this work we study a special type of
relay network called the diamond network or parallel relay
network, introduced by Schein and Gallager [1]. We focus on
the Gaussian case, in which the transmitted signals are real
and subject to an average power constraint, and the received
signals are affected by channel attenuation and additive white
Gaussian noise.
Despite the simplicity of the model, its capacity, that is,
the maximum reliable communication rate from source to
destination, is in general unknown. The best known capacity
upper bound is based on the cut-set bound. Many communication strategies have been proposed, such as decodeand-forward (DF), compress-and-forward (CF), amplify-andforward (AF), bursty-amplify-and-forward (BAF), rematchand-forward (RF), and combinations thereof, leading to various capacity lower bounds. Progress has been made in the
characterization of capacity by establishing the gap, either
additive or multiplicative, between the lower and upper bounds
[2], [3], [5]. Some of these characterizations apply to a general
class single-source multicast networks and can be sharpened
for the special case of symmetric diamond networks.
In this work we focus on the low SNR regime. The capacity
of the Gaussian relay channel (i.e. single relay network) has

III. ACHIEVABLE RATES
A. Existing communication schemes and capacity bounds
In this subsection we obtain the rates achievable with
DF and BAF which will be baselines for comparing the
performance of the proposed scheme BSPDF.
In DF each relay must decode the message transmitted
by the source node. As a result, the achievable rate cannot
exceed the capacity of the point-to-point channel from the
source to each relay. In addition, since both relays decode the
transmitted message, they can beamform their transmissions
to the destination. The achievable rate cannot exceed the
capacity of the multiple-input single-output (MISO) point-topoint channel from the relays to the destination. Combining
both rate constraints we obtain

II. C OMMUNICATION MODEL
We consider a diamond network consisting of a source node
S, two relay nodes Relay i , i = 1, 2, and a destination node D
(cf. Fig. 1).
We denote by X S [t] and Xi [t] the signals transmitted by
the source and relay i = 1, 2 at discrete time t respectively.
We assume the average power of the transmitted signals to
be upper bounded by P S and Pr , i.e. for a large block of n

√
Pr for i = 1, 2. We denote by gi ∈ √ + the channel
R
gain from the source to relay i and by hi ∈ R+ the
channel gain from relay i to the destination, noting that there
is no loss of generality in considering non-negative channel
gains. In the symmetric diamond network that we consider,
g1 = g2 = g and h1 = h2 = h. We normalize the channel
by choosing P S = Pr = 1 and absorbing the values of the
power constraints in the channel gains g and h. The received
signal at relay i = 1, 2, Yi and the received signal at the
√
destination, YD√ are given by Y i [t] = gXS [t] + Zi [t] and
,
2
YD [t] = i=1 hXi [t] + ZD [t] where Z1 [t], Z2 [t] and ZD [t]
are independent identically distributed random variables with
distribution N (0, 1).
The source communicates to the destination a message
W that is uniformly distributed in the set {1, 2, . . . , M }. A
(2nR , n) code for the diamond network consists of a set of
integers M = {1, 2, . . . , 2nR } with 2nR = M , called
the message set and the following encoding and decoding
functions. The source uses an encoding function Enc S :
{1, 2, . . . , M } → Rn to map any message W ∈ M into a
vector (XS [1], . . . , XS [n]) = EncS (W ). At time t relay i
maps the input signals {Y i [1], . . . , Yi [t − 1]} into an output
signal Xi [t] using an encoding function Enc t−1 : Rt−1 → R

for i = 1, 2 and t = 1, . . . , n. The decoder outputs an estimate

In BAF the source and relays transmit only during a fraction
δ of the time, staying silent during the remaining channel uses.
This allows to increase the transmission power at the source
and relays by a factor 1/δ while still satisfying the average
power constraints. Relay i ampliﬁes the received signal by a
factor γi and transmits the signal to destination. The ampliﬁcation factor at relay i, γ i , must satisfy γi 1/(δ + gi ). In the
symmetric channel, the optimal choice is γ 1 = γ2 = 1/(δ+g).
Since the channel is only used a fraction δ of time, which can
be optimized, the resulting achievable rate of the BAF scheme
is

the source encodes a new message in {1, . . . , 2 nR } which
is received by both relays, while the relays encode signals
based on the signals received in block m − 1. Finally, in
block b + 1 the source remains silent while the relays encode
signals based on the signals received in block b. Assuming
that the destination successfully decodes all the messages, the
communication rate is Rb/(b + 1) for large n, which tends
to R as b → ∞. We next describe and analyze the coding
scheme used in each block of length n. To simplify notation,
we use index t to represent the time index in block m for the
signal transmitted at the source and received at the relays, and
the time index in block m + 1 for the signal transmitted by
the relays and received at the destination, for m = 1, . . . , b.
Code construction: We generate a codebook C 1 with 2nR1
random i.i.d. codewords chosen according to the distribution
of U . For each u n 1 ∈ C1 , we generate a codebook C 2,i1 with
1,i
2nR2 codewords with symbols u 2,i1 ,i2 [t] chosen independently
according the distribution of X S |U = u1,i1 [t].
Each message W ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M } is represented by a pair
(i1 , i2 ). The source transmits message (i 1 , i2 ) by sending the
codeword u n 1 ,i2 ∈ C2,i1 . That is,

B. The BSPDF communication scheme
The BSPDF communication scheme that we propose is
a generalization of DF, AF, and BAF. In the BAF scheme,
the bursts occur in predetermined time intervals, and no
information is carried in the timing of the bursts. Our BSPDF
scheme is inspired by the observation that it is possible to
encode information in the burst position as long as the relays
and destination can identify the position of the bursts. The
relays need to determine the burst position in order to know
when to amplify the received signal and when to remain silent.
It is not necessary to transmit in bursts. The effective
SNR of AF can be increased by transmitting sparse or low
duty cycle signals. In the BSPDF scheme we create these
signals by generating a binary codebook C 1 with random i.i.d.
codewords u1,i1 with Bernoulli(δ) symbols, and for each of
these codewords u 1,i1 generating a random codebook C 2,i1
with codewords u 2,i1 ,i2 with symbols distributed as N (0, 1/δ)
for the time indices where u 1,i1 [t] = 1 and with constant value
0 for the time indices where u 1,i1 [t] = 0. The source transmits
a message indexed by (i 1 , i2 ) by transmitting u 2,i1 ,i2 . Then
the relays attempt to decode the binary codeword u 1,i1 and
amplify the received signal only in the time indices t where
u1,i1 [t] = 1, using appropriate gains to satisfy the power
constraints. Finally the receiver attempts to decode both u 1,i1
and u2,i1 ,i2 generating an estimate (ˆ1 , ˆ2 ).

The following theorem establishes the rates that can be
achieved with the BSPDF scheme.

There is an error whenever some relay or the destination
declares an error. For any given block, relay i = 1, 2 declares
an error if the correct codewords u n is not jointly typical
1,1

with Yi , or if an incorrect codeword u n 1 is jointly typical

Theorem 1. Let U be a random variable with Bernoulli(δ)
distribution and let X S be a random variable with conditional
distribution XS |{U = 1} ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) and XS |{U = 0}
having a mass point at 0 with probability 1, where 0 < δ < 1
√
and σ 2 δ < 1. For i = 1, 2, let Yi = gXS + Zi ,√
where Zi ∼
N (0, 1) independent over i. Finally, let Y D = hκU (Y1 +
Y2 ) + ZD , where δκ(gσ 2 + 1) < 1, and ZD ∼ N (0, 1)
independent of everything else. Then, the rate R = R 1 + R2
is achievable in the symmetric diamond network if
R1 < I(U ; Yi ),

i = 1, 2,

R2 < I(XS ; YD |U )
R1 + R2 < I(U, XS ; YD ).
Remark 1. Theorem 1 can be generalized to non-symmetric
diamond networks, with more than 2 relays, and to other
distributions for U and X S [8].
Proof: (Sketch) We communicate over b + 1 blocks of
length n each. In the ﬁrst block, the source sends a message
in {1, . . . , 2nR } which is received by both relays. The relays
remain silent during this ﬁrst block. In block m, 1 < m b,

distribution Y |U = 0 ∼ N (0, σ0 ) and Y |U = 1 ∼ N (0, σ1 ).
Then for small δ we have,

In addition, we declare an error if the average power of
the transmitted signal at the source is larger than one, or if
the average power of the transmitted signal at some relay is
larger than one. This is done to make sure that the power
constraints at the source and relays are satisﬁed.
Using the union bound, the law of large numbers, and
standard properties of jointly typical sets and jointly typical
sequences we can bound the probability of error at the relays
and destination by:

the conditions of the theorem are satisﬁed we can make the
average probability of error of the coding scheme, which is
averaged over all the random codebooks, arbitrarily small for n
large enough. Therefore, there exists a sequence of codebooks
with average probability of error going to zero as n tends to
inﬁnity. As a result, the rate R = R 1 + R2 is achievable.

Theorem 1 provides explicit expressions of achievable rates
for the BSPDF communication scheme. However, ﬁnding the
maximum achievable communication rate requires computing
differential entropies of mixtures of Gaussian random variables
and optimizing over the parameters δ, σ 2 , and κ. To simplify
the numerical computations and to gain more insight into the
low SNR regime we consider an asymptotic regime where the
channel gains tend to zero while maintaining a constant ratio
among them. Since in this regime the channel capacity goes to
zero, we measure performance by the ratio of the achievable
rates and some reference channel gain. Due to our channel
normalization, this asymptotic regime is equivalent to making
PS = Pr = P → 0 in the unnormalized channel while keeping
the channel gains ﬁxed, measuring performance by the ratio
between the achievable rate and some constant times P .
In the asymptotic regime that we consider, the optimal duty
cycle δ of the signals transmitted by the source and relays
with BSPDF tends to zero. In this case, the mixtures of
Gaussian distributions that are required in the evaluation of the
information quantities of Theorem 1 have a main component
occurring with probability (1 − δ) and a secondary component
occurring with probability δ. For small δ, the differential
entropy of these mixtures can be approximated using a Taylor
series expansion as stated in the following Lemma (see [8] for
a proof).

We have numerically solved the optimization for R BSPDF (α)
for various values of h/g. The results are plotted in Fig. 2
together with the achievable rates of DF, BAF, and the cut-set

both DF and BAF in the low SNR regime. It also follows
from the ﬁgure that for a certain range of h/g timesharing
different BSPDF schemes results in higher rates. This suggests
that generalizing BSPDF to more than two power levels (i.e.
{0, P }) to select the codeword symbols in the C 2,i1 may
lead to better performance (see [8] for this generalization and
corresponding performance improvements).

where C(P, ρP ) represents the capacity of the symmetric
diamond network with average power constraint P on the
source node and ρP on the relay nodes.
We can get a lower bound on E b by upper bounding
C(P, ρP ) in (5) using the cut-set upper bound in (3). In
addition, we can ﬁnd an upper bound on the minimum energyper-bit of the diamond network by lower bounding the capacity
in (5) with the achievable rate of any communication scheme.
For example, we can use the capacity lower bounds of DF (1)
and BAF (2) to derive upper bounds on E b .
