Abstract—Sequences with good correlation properties have
been widely adopted in modern communications, radar and sonar
applications. In this paper, we present that a single H-ary Golay
sequence or 4q -QAM Golay sequence has a large zone of zero
odd periodic autocorrelation, where H ≡ 0 ( mod 4) is a positive
integer and q ≥ 2 is an arbitrary integer. The conditions on the
permutations employed in the boolean functions are the same
as those for the sequences with a large zone of zero (even)
periodic autocorrelation. More importantly, sequences with large
odd periodic autocorrelations centered around the origin could
be used to reduce the multipath interference at the receiver end
and thus improve the performance of the communication system.

In [7], Gong et al presented several classes of Golay
sequences and QAM Golay sequences with a zero autocorrelation zone (ZACZ) of length approximately a half, a quarter or
one eighth of their periods. Please refer to [2], [11], [12], [1],
[13] more details on quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
Golay complementary sequences.
Except aperiodic correlation and (even) periodic correlation,
odd periodic correlation is also important [17], [18], [19].
Our motivation is to examine the odd periodic correlation
properties of Golay sequences and QAM Golay complementary sequences when it is being utilized for signal detection and synchronization purposes in applications such as
CDMA and conventional linear time invariant (LTI) system.
More speciﬁcally, if a single Golay sequence or QAM Golay
complementary sequence contains attractive autocorrelation
properties which can be exploited during detection and thus
improves the performance of the system. In this paper, we will
present several constructions of Golay sequences and QAM
Golay sequences with a zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone
(ZOACZ), which have the similar zone as those in [7] under
different constraints.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
provide the necessary preliminary materials required in the
later sections. In Sections III and IV, we show the large zero
odd periodic autocorrelation zone of Golay sequences and
QAM Golay complementary sequences. Finally, we conclude
our paper and point out that a Golay sequence cannot have the
same zero autocorrelation zone and zero odd autocorrelation
zone at the same time in Section V.

Keywords. Golay sequence, zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).
I. I NTRODUCTION
In modern communications, sequences with good correlation properties are desired for receiver synchronization and
detection purposes. In 1961, Golay proposed the idea of
aperiodic complementary sequence pairs [5], of which the sum
of out-of-phase aperiodic autocorrelation equals to zero. Later
on, Davis and Jedwab formulated a method for constructing
Golay complementary pairs by using quadratic generalized
boolean functions [3]. Due to this correlation property, Golay
sequences have been proposed to construct Hadamard matrix
for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA)
system [20], and to control the peak envelope power (PEP) in
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system
[22], [23], [9].
Quasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QSCDMA) system differs from conventional CDMA system [6]
in that it allows a small time delay in the arrival signals of
different users. In this case, sequences with zero correlations
centered at the origin are desired to eliminate or reduce the
multiple access and multipath interference at the receiver end
during detection. Such sequences are called zero correlation
zone (ZCZ) sequences respectively [14]. As a result, the
construction of new LCZ or ZCZ sequences for QS-CDMA
system has received researchers’s much attention [4], [8], [10],
[15], [21], [24].

Let a = (a0 , a1 , · · · , aN −1 ) be a complex sequence of
period N . The aperiodic autocorrelation function, (even) periodic autocorrelation function and odd periodic autocorrelation

respectively given by

where x∗ denotes the conjugate of the complex number x.
Note that odd periodic autocorrelation function is also sometimes referred to as negaperiodic autocorrelation function.
Deﬁnition 1: Let δ1 and δ2 be two integers with 0 < δ1 <
ˆ
δ2 < N and denote L = δ2 − δ1 + 1. If Ra (τ ) = 0 for any
δ1 ≤ τ ≤ δ2 , then the sequence a has a zero odd periodic
autocorrelation zone (ZOACZ) of length L.
Let H ≥ 2 be an arbitrary integer, ZH be the integer residue
√
ring modulo H, and ξ = exp(2π −1/H) be the primitive Hth root of unity. A sequence a = (a0 , a1 , · · · , aN −1 ) over ZH
can be regarded as a complex sequence (ξ a0 , ξ a1 , · · · , ξ aN −1 ).
The sequences a and b are called a Golay complementary pair
if Ca (τ ) + Cb (τ ) = 0 for any 1 ≤ τ ≤ N − 1. Any one of
them is called a Golay sequence.
In the following, we introduce some notations. We always
assume that π is a permutation from {1, · · · , m} to itself,
and (i1 , · · · , im ) is the binary representation of the integer
m
i = k=1 ik 2m−k , where m ≥ 4 is an integer.m

Fact 4: The sequences A and B form a 4q -QAM Golay
complementary pair [13]. Furthermore, for q = 2, A and
B become a 16-QAM Golay complementary pair which is
constructed by Chong, Venkataramani and Tarokh in [2]; For
q = 3, A and B become a 64-QAM Golay complementary pair
which is presented by Lee and Golomb in [11], and Chang,
Li, and Hirata [1].
In the remaining of this paper, we adopt the following
notations: For an integer τ , 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2m − 1, two integers
i and i , 0 ≤ i, i , j, j < 2m , we set j = (i + τ ) mod 2m
and j = (i +τ ) mod 2m , and let (i1 , · · · , im ), (i1 , · · · , im ),
(j1 , · · · , jm ) and (j1 , · · · , jm ) be the binary representations of
i, i , j, j , respectively.

Before presenting the main results in this section, we list
six sets of conditions on permutations π. They all have the
same condition on an afﬁne function with c1 ∈ {H/4, 3H/4}.
(A) π(1) = 1 and π(2) = 2.
(B) π(m) = 1 and π(m − 1) = 2.
(C) π(1) = 1, π(2) = 3, and π(2) = 2.
(D) π(m) = 1, π(m − 1) = 3, and π(m − 2) = 2.
(E) π(1) = 1, π(2) = 3, and π(m) = 2.
(F) π(m) = 1, π(m − 1) = 3, and π(1) = 2.
Theorem 5: If the Golay sequence a, deﬁned by Deﬁnition
2, satisﬁes one of the condition listed in (A) or (B), then the
sequence a has the following property:

then the sequence a has the following property:

where ck ∈ Z4 , k = 0, 1, · · · , m, and si,e and μi are deﬁned
as one of the following cases:
1. si,e = de,0 + de,1 iπ(m) , μi = 2iπ(1) for any element
de,0 , de,1 ∈ Z4 .
2. si,e = de,0 + de,1 iπ(1) , μi = 2iπ(m) for any element
de,0 , de,1 ∈ Z4 .
3. si,e = de,0 + de,1 iπ(w) + de,2 iπ(w+1) , 2de,0 + de,1 +
de,2 = 0, μi = 2iπ(1) , or μi = 2iπ(m) for any element
de,0 , de,1 , de,2 ∈ Z4 and 1 ≤ w ≤ m − 1.

Remark 7: The above theorems show that some Golay
sequences have a large odd periodic autocorrelation zone for
c1 ∈ {H/4, 3H/4}, while in [7], the authors showed that
some Golay sequences have a large ZACZ for c1 ∈ {0, H/2}.
Examples shows that there is no any Golay sequence with the
same large ZACZ and ZOACZ at the same time.
B. Proofs of the Results
In the following, for any given integers τ and u, where
1 ≤ τ ≤ 2m − 1, 0 ≤ i ≤ 2m − 1 − τ and 0 ≤ u ≤ τ − 1, set
v = u+2m −τ , and let (u1 , u2 , · · · , um ) and (v1 , v2 , · · · , vm )
be the binary representations of u and v, respectively.

Now we partition {i : 0 ≤ i < 2m − τ } into the following
three disjoint subsets:

Proof. For the case i ∈ J2 (τ ), setting i and j to be the
two integers deﬁned by

{0 ≤ i < 2m − τ : iπ(1) = jπ(1) }
{0 ≤ i < 2m − τ : iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(m) = jπ(m) }
{0 ≤ i < 2m − τ : iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(m) = jπ(m) }.

Similar to the discussion of i ∈ J1 (τ ), we can prove that

Hence, the aperiodic autocorrelation of a at shift τ is equal to

ai − aj − ai + aj = iπ(1) + jπ(1) + iπ(m) + jπ(m) = H/2

ξ ai −aj . (2) for i ∈ J2 (τ ), which results in

Note that for the cases J1 (τ ) and J2 (τ ), their proofs are

independent of the choice of π and i=1 ci xi + c0 . Hence,
Lemma 8: With the same notation in Fact 3, we have
by Lemmas 8 and 9, (2) can be reduced as

Proof. The proof is quite similar to that of Theorem 3 in
[3]. For completeness, we give it here.
Since j = i, we can deﬁne z as follows:
z = min{1 ≤ k ≤ m : iπ(k) = jπ(k) }.

Replacing τ by 2m − τ , similarly, we have
Ca (2m − τ ) =
u∈J3

ˆ
Note that Ra (τ ) = Ca (τ ) − (Ca (2m − τ ))∗ . We have

Obviously, z ≥ 2. For any i ∈ J1 (τ ), let i and j be the two
integers whose bits in the binary representation are deﬁned by

(4)

Proof. For any given i ∈ J3 (τ ), iπ(1) = jπ(1) and j = i + τ
imply that iπ(1) = 0 and jπ(1) = 1.
First we will show that iπ(2) = jπ(2) for any i ∈ J3 (τ ).
Otherwise iπ(2) = jπ(2) , and then we have
i + τ < 2m−1 + 2m−2 = jπ(1) 2m−1 + jπ(2) 2m−2 ≤ j
which indicates that i + τ < j since τ ≤ 2m−2 . This is a
contradiction with j = i + τ . Hence, one has iπ(2) = jπ(2) .
For any given i ∈ J3 (τ ), let u and v be the two integers
whose bits in the binary representation are deﬁned by

ai − aj − ai + aj

H/2(iπ(z−2) + jπ(z−2) + iπ(z) + jπ(z) ), z > 2

It is obvious to see that 0 ≤ u, v ≤ 2n − 1. Note that the
following facts hold: 1) i → j → u is a one-to-one mapping;
2) v − u = 2m − (j − i) = 2m − τ . Therefore, u enumerates
all the elements in J3 (2m − τ ) as i ranges over J3 (τ ). We

In other words, i and j are obtained from i and j
by “ﬂipping” the (z − 1)-th bit in (iπ(1) , · · · , iπ(m) ) and
(jπ(1) , · · · , jπ(m) ). Note that the following facts hold when
τ is given: 1) i → i is a one-to-one mapping; 2) j − i =
j − i = τ ; 3) iπ(1) = jπ(1) . Therefore, i enumerates all the
elements in J1 (τ ) as i ranges over J1 (τ ). Given i ∈ J1 (τ ),
by the deﬁnition of z in (3) we then have

In Section III, the idea of the proof on the ZOACZ of Golay

that ξ ai −aj − ξ av −au = 0.
Sketch proof of Theorem 12: Note that ai,0 is a quaternary

that the left side of (6) is equal to zero for 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2m−2 .
This is given by Lemma 10. For the case (B), by deﬁning a
mapping π (k) = π(m+1−k), k ∈ {1, · · · , m}, and replacing
π by π , the conclusion follows from that in case (A).
Lemma 11: With the same notation in Theorem 6 under

In this paper, we have shown that some Golay sequences
over ZH and 4q -QAM Golay complementary sequences have
a large zero odd periodic autocorrelation zone, where H ≡
0 (mod 4) is a positive integer and q ≥ 2 is an arbitrary
integer. The parameters of those constructions are the same to
those in [7] except for the values of H and c1 . Those classes
of Golay sequences or 4q -QAM sequences with large zero odd
periodic autocorrelation zone are disjoint with those sequences
with large zero autocorrelation zone. Those sequences with
large zero autocorrelation zone centered around the origin can
help reducing the multipath interference during the synchronization and detection, thus to improve the performance of the
system. Single sequences with large autocorrelation zone can
potentially be utilized to construct signal sets with desirable
auto and cross correlation properties. This can help reduce
the multi access interference. Note that a Golay sequence can
not have the same large zero autocorrelation zone and zero
ˆ
odd autocorrelation zone. Otherwise, if Ra (τ ) = Ra (τ ) = 0
for some consecutive τ , then we have Ca (τ ) = 0 for those
consecutive τ . Since
2m −1−τ

Ca (τ ) =
i=0

ξ ai −ai+τ =

H−1

Nk ξ k

k=0

where Nk = |{0 ≤ i < 2m − τ : ai − ai+τ ≡ k (mod H)}|,
then we have
H−1

Nj ξ j = 0 for some consecutive τ .

j=0

This indicates that N0 = N1 = · · · = NH−1 . Note that
H−1
m
j=0 Nj = 2 − τ . So we have
2m − τ = HN0 ≡ 0 (mod 2)
since H is even, and then τ is even. This contradicts the fact
that τ is consecutive or could be odd.
For the applications mentioned above, we should investigate
the following questions:
1) Look for sequences with zero autocorrelation zone
which also process low odd periodic autocorrelation with
the same zone.
2) Look for sequences with zero odd autocorrelation zone
which also process low periodic autocorrelation with the
same zone.
3) If the two above scenarios cannot be satisﬁed, then the
alternative is to look for sequences with low autocorrelation zone and low odd periodic autocorrelation with
the same zone. This is equivalent to ﬁnding sequences
with low aperiodic autocorrelation within a large zone.
