columns indexed by L. Likewise, we denote by Aj the j th
row of A, and by AJ the submatrix of A with rows given by
the subset J of the row indices.

II. N ETWORK -E RROR C ORRECTING C ODES

Abstract—Matroidal networks were introduced by Dougherty
et al. and have been well studied in the recent past. It was shown
that a network has a scalar linear network coding solution if and
only if it is matroidal associated with a representable matroid.
The current work attempts to establish a connection between
matroid theory and network-error correcting codes. In a similar
vein to the theory connecting matroids and network coding, we
abstract the essential aspects of network-error correcting codes
to arrive at the deﬁnition of a matroidal error correcting network.
An acyclic network (with arbitrary sink demands) is then shown
to possess a scalar linear error correcting network code if and
only if it is a matroidal error correcting network associated with
a representable matroid. Therefore, constructing such networkerror correcting codes implies the construction of certain representable matroids that satisfy some special conditions, and vice
versa.

As in [4], [6], we model the directed acyclic network as a
directed acyclic multigraph (one with parallel edges) G(V, E)
where V is the set of vertices of G representing the nodes in the
network and E is the set of edges representing the links in the
network. An ancestral ordering is assumed on E as the network
is acyclic. Each edge is assumed to carry at most one ﬁnite
ﬁeld symbol at any given time instant. A non-empty subset
S ⊆ V, called the set of sources, generates the information
that is meant for the sinks in the network, represented by
another non-empty subset T ⊆ V. Each sink demands a
particular subset of the information symbols generated by the
sources. Any node in the network can be a source and a
sink simultaneously, however not generating and demanding
the same information. Let nsi be the number of information
symbols (from some ﬁnite ﬁeld F) generated at source si . Let
|S|
µ = 1, 2, ..., i=1 nsi = n denote the ordered index set
of messages (each corresponding to a particular information
symbol) generated at all the sources. For each edge e ∈ E,
we denote by tail(e) the node from which e is outgoing, and
by head(e) the node to which e is incoming. Also, for each
node v ∈ V, let In(v) denote the union of the messages (a
subset of µ) generated by v and the set of incoming edges
at v. Similarly, let Out(v) denote the union of the subset of
messages demanded by v and the set of outgoing edges from
v. For any e ∈ E, we denote by In(e) the set In(tail(e)).
A network code on G is a collection of functions, one associated with each node of the network mapping the incoming
symbols at that node to its outgoing symbols. When these
functions are scalar linear, the network code is said to be
a scalar linear network code. In other words, a scalar linear
network code is an assignment to the following matrices.
• A matrix Asi of size nsi ×|E|, for each source si ∈ S, i =
1, 2, ..., |S|, denoting the linear combinations taken by the
sources mapping information symbols to the network.
• A matrix K of size |E| × |E| which indicates the linear
combinations taken by the nodes in the network to map
incoming symbols to outgoing symbols.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Matroids are discrete objects which abstract the notions of
linear dependence among vectors. The relationship between
network coding (introduced in [1]) and matroid theory was ﬁrst
introduced in [2] and further developed in [3]. The authors of
[2], [3] showed that the scalar linear solvability of a network
with a given set of demands was related to the existence of
a representable matroid (matroids which arise from matrices
over ﬁelds) satisfying certain properties.
In the current work, we present the connection between
matroids and network-error correcting codes, which was introduced in [4] and further developed in [5]. The results of
this work may be considered as the network-error correction
counterparts of some of the results of [2], [3]. We deﬁne
the notion of a matroidal error correcting network associated
with a particular matroid. Using this deﬁnition, we show
that a network has a scalar linear network-error correcting
code if and only if there exists a representable matroid M
such that the given network is a matroidal error correcting
network associated with M. Therefore, networks with scalar
network-error correcting codes are shown to be analogous to
representable matroids satisfying a certain set of properties.
Notations: The following notations will be followed
throughout the paper. A ﬁnite ﬁeld is denoted by the symbol
F. For some positive integer k, the identity matrix of size k
over F is denoted by Ik . The transpose of a matrix A over
F is denoted by AT . The space spanned by the columns of
a matrix A over F is denoted by cols(A). The support set of
a vector x and its Hamming weight are denoted by supp(x)
and wH (x) respectively. The symbol 0 represents an all zero
vector or matrix of appropriate size indicated explicitly or
known according to the context. For some matrix A, we denote

1

For more details on these matrices, we refer the reader to
[6]. Also, to each sink t ∈ T , we associate a matrix Bt of
size |E| × nt , where nt is the number of incoming edges at t.
Corresponding to the nt rows that index these incoming edges,
we ﬁx the nt × nt submatrix of Bt as an identity submatrix.
The other entries of Bt are ﬁxed as zeroes.
For i = 1, 2, ..., |S|, let xsi ∈ Fnsi be the row vector
representing the information symbols at source si . Let F =

I|E| − K

matrix

The error pattern corresponding to a network-error vector
z is deﬁned as its support set supp(z), which we shall also
alternatively refer to using the corresponding subset of E. Let
Fsupp(z),t denote the submatrix of Ft consisting of those
rows of Ft which are indexed by supp(z). The condition (2)
can then be rewritten as
yt = (x z )

= 0 ∈ Fnt , ∀ xsDt = 0,

∀ z ∈ F2α , ∀ supp(z) ∈ {F ⊆ E : |F| = 2α} .

A. A technical lemma
We now present a technical lemma, which will be used in
Section IV.
Lemma 1: Let IDt denote the (n + 2α) × |Dt | matrix
with a |Dt | × |Dt | identity submatrix in |Dt | of the ﬁrst
n rows corresponding to the demands Dt at sink t, and
with all other elements being zero. For some supp(z) ∈
{F ⊆ E : |F| = 2α} , the condition

The columns of AF are known as the global encoding vectors
corresponding to the edges of the network, indicating the
particular linear combinations of the information symbols
which ﬂow in the edges. We assume that no edge is assigned
an all zero global encoding vector, for then it can simply
be removed from the network and a smaller graph can be
assumed. The global encoding vector corresponding to the n
messages are ﬁxed to be the n standard basis vectors over F. A
network code can also be speciﬁed completely by specifying
global encoding vectors for all edges in the network, provided
that they are valid assignments, i.e., global encoding vectors of
outgoing edges are linear combinations of those of incoming
edges.
Let x = xs1 xs2 ... xs|S| be the vector of all information symbols. Let Dt ⊆ µ denote the set of demands at
sink t, and let xsDt denote the subvector of the super-vector
x corresponding to the information symbols indexed by Dt .
An edge is said to be in error if its input symbol and output
symbol (both from F) are not the same. We call this as a
network-error. We model the network-error as an additive error
from F. A network-error vector is a |E| length row vector
over F, whose components indicate the additive errors on
the corresponding edges. The case of multicast network-error
correction, where a single source multicasts all its symbols
to all sinks in the presence of errors, has been discussed in
several papers (see for example, [4], [5]) all being equivalent
in some sense. Network-error correction was extended to case
of non-multicast in [7]. Here, we brieﬂy review the results for
network-error correcting codes in the case of arbitrary number
of sources and sinks with arbitrary demands.
Let z be the network-error vector corresponding to a particular instance of communication in the network. Let FS,t be
the matrix AF Bt . Let F Bt = Ft . Then a sink t receives the
nt length vector yt = xFS,t + zFt .
A network code which enables every sink to successfully
recover the desired information symbols in the presence of any
network-errors in any set of edges of cardinality at most α is
said to be a α network-error correcting code. It is not difﬁcult
to see that a scalar linear network code is a scalar linear
α network-error correcting code if and only if the following
condition holds at each sink t ∈ T .

Therefore a given network code is α network-error correcting
if and only if the above condition holds for all supp(z) ∈
{F ⊆ E : |F| = 2α} at all sinks t ∈ T .
Proof: See [8].
III. M ATROIDS
In this section, we provide some basic deﬁnitions and results
from matroid theory that will be used throughout this paper.
For more details, the reader is referred to [9].
Deﬁnition 1: Let E be a ﬁnite set. A matroid M on E is an
ordered pair (E, I), where the set I is a collection of subsets
of E satisfying the following three conditions
1) φ ∈ I.
2) If X ∈ I and X ⊆ X, then X ∈ I.
3) If X1 and X2 are in I and |X1 | < |X2 |, then there is an
element e of X2 − X1 such that X1 ∪ e ∈ I.
The set E is called the ground set of the matroid and is also
referred to as E(M). The members of set I (also referred to
as I(M)) are called the independent sets of M. A maximal
independent subset of E is called a basis of M, and the set
of all bases of M is denoted by B(M). The set I(M) is
then obtained as I(M) = {X ⊆ B : B ∈ B(M)} . A subset
of E which is not in I is called a dependent set. With M, a
function called the rank function is associated, whose domain
is the power set 2E and codomain is the set of non-negative
integers. The rank of any X ⊆ E in M, denoted by rM (X),
is deﬁned as the maximum cardinality of a subset of X that
is a member of I(M). We denote rM (E(M)) = r(M).
Deﬁnition 2: The vector matroid associated with a matrix
A over F, denoted by M[A], is deﬁned as the ordered pair
(E, I) where E consists of the set of column labels of A,
and I consists of all the subsets of E which index columns
that are linearly independent over F. An arbitrary matroid M
is said to be F-representable if it is isomorphic to a vector

yt = xFS,t + zFt = 0 ∈ Fnt ,
∀ xsDt = 0 ∈ F|Dt | , ∀ z ∈ z ∈ F|E| : wH (z) ≤ 2α .

(B1) f (ei ) ∈ clM (B − f (µ))
/
(B2) rM (f (In(ei )) ∪ f (ei ) ∪ bn+i )
= rM (f (In(ei )) ∪ bn+i )

matroid associated with some matrix A over F. The matrix A
is then said to be a representation of M. The rank function
of a representable matroid M, given by rM (X), X ⊆ E
is therefore equal to the rank of the submatrix of columns
corresponding to X in the matrix A to which the matroid is
associated.
Lemma 2 ( [9]): Let M = M[A], A being some matrix
over F. The matroid M remains unchanged if any of the
following operations are performed on A
• Interchange two rows.
• Multiply a row by a non-zero member of F.
• Replace a row by the sum of that row and another.
• Adjoin or delete a zero row.
• Multiply a column by a non-zero member of F.
By the row operations of Lemma 2, it is clear that any Frepresentable matroid can be expressed as the vector matroid
of a matrix of the form Ir(M) Ar(M)×(|E(M)|−r(M)) ,
with elements from F.
Deﬁnition 3: Let M be a matroid on E and T ⊆ E.
Consider the set I
I = {I ⊆ E − T : I ∪ BT ∈ I(M)}

= rM (f (In(ei ))) + rM (bn+i )
= rM (f (In(ei ))) + 1.
(C) For each error pattern F = {ei1 , ei2 , ..., ei2α } ∈ F, let
BF = B −f (µ)−{bn+i1 , bn+i2 , ..., bn+i2α } . Let MF be
the n+2α+|E| element matroid M/BF . Let fF : µ∪E →
E(MF ) be a function such that fF (x) = f (x), ∀ x ∈
µ ∪ E. Then, at every sink t ∈ T , for each F ∈ F, we
must have
rMF (fF (InE (t)) ∪ fF (Dt )) = rMF (fF (InE (t))) ,
where InE (t) ⊆ In(t) denotes the set of incoming edges
at sink t and Dt is the set of demands at t.
Remark 1: In Condition (C) of Deﬁnition 5, the condition
fF (x) = f (x) for all x ∈ µ∪E requires that all f (x), x ∈ µ∪E
exist in E(MF ) in the ﬁrst place. However, this is ensured by
Condition (B1). To see this, ﬁrst we note that f (µ) ⊂ E(MF )
because these elements are in B and are not contracted out of
M. Now consider the set f (e) ∪ (B − f (µ)) for any e ∈ E,
which is independent in M because of Condition (B1). By (5)
in the deﬁnition of the contraction of a matroid, we have that
f (e) exists and is also not dependent in MF . Therefore, fF
is well deﬁned. As fF (x) = f (x) for all x ∈ µ ∪ E, we shall
use f to denote fF also.
We now present the main result of this paper which is the
counterpart of the results from [2], [3] which relate networks
with scalar linearly solvable network codes to representable
matroids.
Theorem 1: Let G(V, E) be an acyclic communication network with sources S and sinks T . The network G is a
matroidal α error correcting network associated with a Frepresentable matroid if and only if it has a scalar linear
network-error correcting code over F that can correct any α
network-errors.
Proof: If part: Suppose there exists a scalar linear α
network-error correcting code over F for G with the matrices
Asi (i = 1, 2, ..., |S|), F and Bt , t ∈ T , as deﬁned in Section
II, according to the given topological ordering on E. Let A be
the matrix as in (1).
AF
Let X be the row-wise concatenated matrix
of
F
size (n + |E|) × |E|, and Y be the column-wise concatenated
matrix In+|E| X . Also, let M = M[Y], the vector
matroid associated with Y, with E(M) being the set of
column indices of Y. Let f : E ∪ µ → E(M) be the function
deﬁned as follows.

(5)

where BT ⊆ T is a maximal independent subset within T.
Then I satisﬁes the axiom for the set of independent sets of
a matroid with ground set E − T. We call this matroid as the
contraction of T from M, denoted as M/T.
The contraction of a F-representable matroid is also Frepresentable. Let M[A] be the vector matroid associated with
a matrix A over F. Let e be a non-zero column of A. Suppose
using the elementary row operations listed in Lemma 2, we
transform A to obtain a matrix A which has a single nonzero entry in column e. Let A / {e} denote the matrix which
is obtained by deleting the row and column containing the
only non-zero entry of e. Then M[A]/ {e} = M[A / {e}].
Deﬁnition 4: Let M be a matroid on E and X be a subset
of E. The closure of X is then deﬁned to be the set clM (X) =
{x ∈ E : rM (X ∪ x) = rM (X)} .
IV. M ATROIDAL E RROR C ORRECTING N ETWORKS
In this section, we introduce matroidal error correcting
networks by extending the deﬁnition of matroidal networks
of [2] for the case of networks where errors occur.
Deﬁnition 5: Let G(V, E) be an acyclic network with a
collection of sources S with message set µ (with n elements)
and sinks T , and a given topological order on E. Let α ≤ |E|
be a non-negative integer, and F = {F ⊆ E : |F| = 2α} be
the collection of error patterns of size 2α. Let M be a
matroid over a ground set E with n + 2|E| elements, and with
r(M) = n + |E|. The network G is said to be a matroidal α
error correcting network associated with M, if there exists a
function f : µ∪E → E(M) such that the following conditions
are satisﬁed.
(A) f is one-one on µ, where f (µ) = ∪m∈µ f (m) ∈ I(M).
(B) For some basis B of M obtained by extending f (µ)
(where B − f (µ) = bn+1 , ..., bn+|E| is ordered according to the given topological order on E), the following
conditions should hold for all ei ∈ E, taken in the given
topological order.

f (mi ) = i, mi ∈ µ, i = 1, 2, ..., n.
f (ei ) = n + |E| + i, ∀ ei ∈ E in the given ordering.
We shall now prove the matroid M and function f satisfy the
conditions of the theorem. Towards this end, ﬁrst we see that
Condition (A) holds by deﬁnition of function f.
To see that Condition (B1) holds, consider the basis B =
{1, 2, ..., n + |E|}, i.e., the ﬁrst n + |E| columns of Y. Then

3

But according to Section II, we have, AF f (InE (t)) = FS,t ,
f (In (t))
and F I(F )E
= Fsupp(z),t , where supp(z) = F. By
Lemma 1, as the given network code is α network-error
correcting, we must have IDt ⊆ cols Z f (InE (t)) , where
Dt ⊆ µ is the set of demands at t. But then IDt = Z f (Dt ) .
This proves Condition (C) for sink t. The choice of error
pattern and sink being arbitrary, this proves the If part of the
theorem.
Only If part: Let M be the given F-representable
matroid, along with the function f, and basis B =
˙
f (µ)∪ bn+1 , bn+2 , ..., bn+|E| that satisfy the given set of
conditions. Let Y = (In+|E| X ) be a representation of M
over F, such that B = {1, 2, ..., n + |E|} . First we prove the
following claim.
Claim: There exists a n × |E| matrix A, and a |E| × |E|
matrix F of the form F = (I|E| − K)−1 for some strictly
upper-triangular matrix K, such that

we have that Y n+|E|+i ∈ cols(Y B−f (µ) ), because no edge is
/
assigned a zero-global encoding vector, i.e., no column of AF
is non-zero. Thus Condition (B1) holds.
To show Condition (B2), ﬁrst note that because the given
set of coding coefﬁcients for the network is a (valid) network
code, F is such that

ei ∈ E :

where 1j is a column vector in F|E| with all zeros except for
the j th entry which is 1 ∈ F. Also, (6) implies that

mi ∈µ

As Condition (B1) holds, we must have at least one ci,j =
0, ∀i = 1, 2, ..., n and because of Condition (B2), we must
have aj,j = aj,j = 0. This structure of Y f (ej ) also implies
that Y f (ej ) = Y b , for any b ∈ B. Moreover, we also see that
Y f (ei ) = Y f (ej ) , for any distinct pair ei , ej of edges in E.
Arranging all the Y f (ei ) s in the given topological order (i.e.,
with f (ej ) = n + |E| + j), we get Y f (E) = X , and

where Y n+j corresponds to bn+j ∈ B − f (µ) and the
non-zero coefﬁcients of Aj can occur only in those positions corresponding to the set of messages generated at
tail(ej ), if any, which is a subset of In(tail(ej )). Moreover,
Y n+j ∈ cols Y f (In(ej )) , because the (n + j)th row of
/
Y f (In(ej )) is all-zero because of the topological ordering in
the acyclic network. Thus Y n+|E|+j ∈ cols Y f (In(ej ))∪bn+j .
This proves that Condition (B2) holds.
Now we prove that Condition (C) also holds. Let I(F) =
{i1 , i2 , ..., i2α } be the index set following the topological
ordering corresponding to an arbitrary error pattern F ∈ F and
let the set {n + i1 , n + i2 , ..., n + i2α } be denoted as n+I(F).
First we note that by deﬁnition, MF is the vector matroid of
the matrix

X =

By Lemma 2, the matroid M does not change if some
row or some column of Y = (In+|E| X ) is multiplied
by a non-zero element of F. Let Y be the matrix obtained
from Y by multiplying the rows {n + 1, n + 2, ..., n + |E|}

V. D ISCUSSION
Exploiting the analogy between matroids and network error
correcting codes shown in this work, we present a construction
of matroidal error correcting multicast and multiple-unicast
networks in [8]. Using this construction, a MATLAB algorithm
is used in [8] to generate multicast and multiple-unicast
networks with scalar linear network error correcting codes.
Following techniques similar to [2], it might be possible to
show that there exists networks where linear network codes
prove insufﬁcient to provide the demanded error correction.

is the basis vector which picks the j th column of H, which
is equal to J j . We now use induction on j (according to the
topological order) to show that J j = HLj , ∀ j = 1, 2, ..., |E|.
Now assume that for some ej , all ei ∈ In(ej ) are such that
J i = HLi . By (9), we have
Jj =

By Condition (C), we have Z f (Dt ) ⊆ cols(Z f (InE (t)) ). But
we have by the notations of Section II, for supp(z) = F

As M is the vector matroid of Y also, without loss of
generality we assume that Y = Y , with a1,1 = a2,2 = ... =

Now let H be the n × |E| matrix whose columns are
populated as follows. For all j = 1, 2, ..., |E|,

= HLj ,
where the second equality above follows from the induction
assumption and the deﬁnition of H j , 1j is a column vector of
length |E| with all zeros except for the 1 at j th position, and
the last equality follows from (9). Thus we have J j = HLj .
Continuing the induction on j, we have that J j = HLj , ∀ j =
HL
1, 2, .., |E|. Therefore, we have X =
. Thus, with
L
A = H, and F = L, we have that X is of the form as in (8).
This proves the claim.
We ﬁnally show that there is a scalar linear α network-error
correcting code for G. Let the matrices Asi , i = 1, 2, ..., |S|
be obtained according to (1) with H = A, and let the network
coding matrix K = I − L−1 . Then, the columns of the matrix
HL denote the global encoding vectors of the edges of E in
the given topological order. Clearly this is a valid network
code for G, by the structure of the matrices H and L.
For some arbitrary error pattern, F ∈ F, MF (as in
Condition (C)) is clearly the vector matroid of the matrix
