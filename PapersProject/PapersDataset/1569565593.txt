calculus, a set of Euler-Lagrange differential equations can
be explicitly speciﬁed as necessary and sufﬁcient conditions.
Saddle-point solutions can then be obtained either analytically
or numerically.
The paper is structured as follows. Sec. II introduces our
ﬁngerprinting model and brieﬂy reviews the results in [3], [5].
Sec. III and IV attack small- and large-coalitions games of
ﬁngerprinting capacity respectively. Due to lack of space we
have omitted many detailed derivations and explanations from
this extended abstract. Details will be given in the full version
of the paper.

Abstract—Fingerprinting capacity has recently been derived
as the value of a two-person zero-sum game. In this work, we
study ﬁngerprinting capacity games with k pirates under the
ˇ
combined digit model proposed by Skori´ et al. For small k,
c
capacities along with optimal strategies for both players of the
game are obtained explicitly. For large k, we extend our earlier
asymptotic analysis for the binary alphabet to this general model
and show that capacity is asymptotic to A/k2 where the constant
A is identiﬁed. Saddle-point solutions to the functional maximin
game are obtained using methods of variational calculus.

I. I NTRODUCTION
This paper studies some theoretical aspects the of digital
ﬁngerprinting. Before distribution of a copyrighted content, a
ﬁngerprinting system embeds a unique identiﬁcation ﬁngerprint into each copy, which can be extracted and helps trace
unauthorized redistribution. A collusion attack is a powerful
attack by a group of malicious users called pirates who combine their copies to generate a new version that contains only
weak traces of their ﬁngerprints. The goal of a ﬁngerprinting
decoder is to identify the pirates even under severe collusion
attacks.
The challenges of designing an effective ﬁngerprinting system are manyfold. Firstly, it is difﬁcult to construct a suitable
uniﬁed model that describes the pirates’ collusion activities
for different applications. Secondly, theoretical studies have
shown that the maximum achievable rate, or capacity, decays
quadratically with the size of the coalition k [1]. Thirdly, recent constructions on capacity-achieving ﬁngerprinting codes
require exponential computational complexity [2], [3] while
efﬁcient designs fall short in achieving capacity [1], [3], [4].
In this work, we attempt to bring the theory one step
closer to practical requirements. We revisit the games of
ﬁngerprinting capacity [3], [5] under a modiﬁed version of
ˇ
the newly proposed combined digit model (CDM) by Skori´
c
et al. [6]. Our earlier results in [5] are extended under this new
CDM. For small coalitions, analytical or numerical solutions
are evaluated for different setups. The results not only show
how capacity depends on the model, but also shed light on
the structures of capacity-achieving codes, and on how the
colluders can maximally utilize their copies to avoid detection.
Asymptotic analysis allows us to approximate capacity and
optimal strategies when exact solution for large coalitions is
not feasible. We show how the asymptotic analysis of [5] can
be generalized to CDM. Also using the methods of variational

Notation
The mutual information of random variables X and Y is
denoted by I(X; Y ). The binary entropy function is denoted
by hq (p) = −p logq p − (1 − p) logq (1 − p). The base-q
Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability vectors
p and q is denoted by Dq (p q). The indicator function
denoted by δab takes value one if a = b and zero otherwise. The shorthand f ∼ g denotes the asymptotic equality
limk→∞ [f (k)/g(k)] = 1.

A. Fingerprinting System
Let X = Q = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1} denote a size-q alphabet,
M = {1, . . . , M } denote the user index set, and Wn a set of
secret key values. An (n, M ) randomized ﬁngerprinting code
C over X , or ﬁngerprinting ensemble, consists of an encoderdecoder pair (en , dn ). The encoder
en : M × W n → X n
assigns user m a length-n ﬁngerprint Xm = en (m, Wn ) where
Wn is the random key. The mapping en is known to the public
but the realization of Wn is kept secret from the pirates.
A coalition is formed by a subset of k users. Without loss of generality, we denote the set of indices by
K = {1, . . . , k}. The colluders observe ﬁngerprint sequences
XK = {X1 , . . . , Xk } and use them to produce a forgery
Y ∈ Y n . The process can be modeled by passing XK through
a collusion channel pY|XK .
Based upon the received forgery and the secret key Wn , the
decoder

The set of admissible collusion channels determines the
coalition’s capability of manipulating the ﬁngerprint sequences
available to them. The Boneh-Shaw marking assumption and
its nonbinary alphabet variants [7], [8] are the most commonly
adopted model in the literature. However, these models fail
ˇ
to completely capture plausible colluders’ actions. Skori´ et.
c
al. [6] recently proposed a more general setup called the
combined digit model. However, it combines the collusion
and the decoding process and is very hard to analyze. Here
we introduce a modiﬁed version of CDM which is tractable
and retains the spirit of the original model. We show how all
variants of the marking assumption ﬁt into our new model and
the trade-off among parameters.
We consider a memoryless collusion channel pY|XK , i.e.,

i=1

pY |XK (yi |xK,i ),

which implies that for each coordinate i the forgery symbol
yi depends only on x1,i , . . . , xk,i . Therefore the collusion can
be characterized by the single-lettered channel pY |XK and we
will drop the coordinate index i in the following analysis. We
also assume the channel to be user-symmetric, which means
that the forgery depends only on the sequences available to
the coalition, but not on which pirates receiving them. Here
we let Z = [Z0 , Z1 , . . . , Zq−1 ] ∈ {0, . . . , k}q with

C. Fingerprinting Capacity
Given a ﬁngerprinting code C and a class P c of collusion
channels, the worst-case error probabilities under the detect-all
and the detect-one criteria are deﬁned by

= {zj }t
j=1

(where t |Z|) be the set of all possible Z. Based on the usersymmetry assumption, Z is a sufﬁcient statistic in generating
Y , and the colluders’ strategy can be modeled by the set
{θ(z)}z∈Z where
θy (z)

,

where N (z) ≤ k denotes the number of distinct symbols seen
by the pirates.
This is indeed a fairly general model as it reduces to the
following four variants of the marking assumption in the
literature with different choices of rc and re :
• Restricted digit model (RDM): RDM only allows the
colluders to “mix and match” their copies of the content,
i.e., Y can only be one of the symbols in XK .
• Unreadable digit model (UDM): UDM allows slightly
stronger attacks. Besides the symbols they have, the
colluders can also generate an erasure when N (z) > 1.
• Arbitrary digit model (ADM): ADM does not allow
erasures, but Y can be any symbol in Q when N (z) > 1.
In Sec. III we show that ADM allows stronger attacks
than UDM.
• General digit model (GDM): GDM allows Y to be any
symbol in Q or an erasure when N (z) > 1. This allows
the strongest attacks.
Table I summarizes the parameters corresponding to different models. It also shows realistic values of parameters
based on simulations in [6]. Collusion classes are denoted
by PRDM , PUDM , etc. for speciﬁc models or P c in general.
Collusion channels in our following analysis are represented
by the (q + 1) × t matrix Θ [θ(z1 ), · · · , θ(zt )].

sequence of rate-R ﬁngerprinting codes with vanishing worstone
case error probability. The ﬁngerprinting capacities Ck,q (P c )
all
c
and Ck,q (P ) are deﬁned as the suprema of all achievable
rates with respect to the detect-one and detect-all criteria,
respectively.
As studied in [3], [5], the following two-phase ﬁngerprinting
construction and joint/simple decoding scheme approaches or
achieves capacity:
1) Encoding scheme: Let PW be a probability distribution
on the (q − 1)-dimensional simplex W q { w 1 = 1} .
A sequence of auxiliary random variables {Wi }n is
i=1
drawn independent and identically from the distribution
PW . For each i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, {Xm,i }M
m=1 are M
independent and identically distributed random variables
constructed from a categorical distribution with parameter
Wi . The class of all probability distributions on W q is
denoted by PW , and Pe denotes a compact subset of PW .
2) Decoding scheme: Two decoding schemes are proposed
in [3]. The simple decoder evaluates the empirical mutual
information I(xm ; y|w) for each user m and user m is
accused if and only if I(xm ; y|w) > η simple for some
threshold η simple . The joint decoder evaluates the score
S(A) = I(xA ; y|w) − |A|η joint for each coalition A ⊆
M where η joint is a threshold. The set A that has the
largest score is then accused.

The maximizing and minimizing strategies are denoted
(k,q)
by PW and Θ(k,q) respectively.
It is worth mentioning that although the simple decoding
scheme fails to achieve capacity, its computational complexity
is much lower than that of the joint decoding scheme. In Sec.
joint
simple
IV we show that the gap between Ck,q (P c ) and Ck,q (P c )
is actually negligible for large k.
III. F IGHTING S MALL C OALITIONS
Owing to the existence of the saddle-point solutions, the
joint and simple ﬁngerprinting capacity games can be solved
either analytically or numerically when k is small. In [5]
we showed the solutions for the binary alphabet case. Our
algorithm can be generalized to the q-ary alphabet with the
combined digit model. Also besides the user-symmetry constraint discussed in Sec. II, we impose symbol-symmetry on
both the embedding distribution PW and the collusion channel
Θ. This constraint enforces both players to treat each symbol
equally and greatly simpliﬁes the analysis. The optimality of
symbol-symmetric strategies is discussed in [5].
A. One Pirate
For k = 1, the joint and simple capacity games are the same.
The maximin game of (3) reduces to a compound channel
capacity game, or to a watermarking game [3]. For the four
variants of the marking assumption, capacity is trivially one.
(k,q)
For CDM, the optimal embedding distribution is Wx
≡ 1/q
for all x ∈ X . Upon receiving z = [1, 0, · · · , 0] , the colluder
utilizes strategy θ(z) = [1 − pc − pe , pc /(q − 1), · · · , pc /(q −
1), pe ] where pc is the crossover probability and pe is the
(k,q)
erasure probability. The optimal strategy is pe

taken with respect to PW . Also if P e = PW , then we drop

theorem summarizes the results in [3], [5].

where (x)+ max(x, 0). Using parameters in [6], the loss in
capacity from the ideal case is about 20% if parameters are
chosen properly.
B. Two Pirates
By studying the simplest case involving collusion attacks, we can see how different models allow different
strengths of attacks. By symbol-symmetry there are only
two types of patterns in Z, namely z1 = [2, 0, . . . , 0]
and z2 = [1, 1, 0, . . . , 0] . Similar to the analysis in III-A,
the crossover probabilities pc and the erasure probabilities pe determine the collusion attack. More speciﬁcally,

joint

all

Ck,q (P c ) = Ck,q (P c ) = Ck,q (P c ) ≥ Ck,q (P c ),

i.e., the joint decoding scheme achieves capacity while
the simple decoding scheme is generally suboptimal (the
inequality is in general strict).

A. Continuous Functional Game Approximation
We consider the sequence of joint/simple ﬁngerprinting
games. Similarly to [5], we impose a regularity condition on
the collusion channel Θ:

optimal collusion channel can then be characterized by pc

and pe . Numerical solutions for the joint capacity game
for binary and ternary alphabets are shown in Table II.
IV. A SYMPTOTICS FOR L ARGE C OALITIONS
The analysis in Sec. III allows us to solve the ﬁngerprinting
games for small coalitions. However, the solution itself has
cardinality in Θ(k q−1 ). For the binary case the complexity
grows linearly with k and we showed the solutions for up
to tens of pirates [5]. For the nonbinary case, the curse of
dimensionality makes the task difﬁcult even for small k. Therefore good approximations of the games’ solutions for largecoalition asymptotics (k → ∞) are important. Independently
ˇ
of this work, Boesten and Skori´ [9] extended our asymptotic
c
results in [5] to nonbinary alphabets under RDM. The analysis
showed that the asymptotic joint capacity is (q − 1)/(2k 2 ln q)
but it did not reveal the optimal strategies. Here we show
how we can extend our analysis of [5] to the more general
combined digit model for both the joint and simple capacity
games. Our main results are the following theorems:
Theorem 2: Assume that Condition 1 (deﬁned below) is
satisﬁed, then we have

when A (deﬁned below in (12)) is nonzero. Note that A
depends on the embedding distribution class P e and the
collusion class P c and is independent of the coalition size
k.
Theorem 3: The ﬁngerprinting capacities under RDM satisﬁes
joint
Ck (PRDM )

(7)

as k → ∞.
The condition assumes a smooth limiting function for the
sequence of collusion channels. For the binary case, the
assumption seems valid for the joint capacity game but not for
the simple capacity game [5]. However, as the simple decoding
scheme is indeed suboptimal, we assume the colluders do not
exploit such suboptimality and perform the optimal attack in
terms of capacity.
By the deﬁnitions in Sec. II, the conditional distribution
of Z given w follows the multinomial law with parameter
w and k trials. We denote the probability mass functions
by αz (w)
pZ|W (z|w) for z ∈ Z and w ∈ W q . Let
α(w) = [αz1 (w), . . . , αzt (w)] be a length-t probability
x
vector. Similarly αz (w)
pZ|X1 W (z|x, w) for x ∈ X ,
q
z ∈ Z, and w ∈ W .
Under the regularity constraint, the following theorem reduces the payoff functions for the joint/simple capacity games
to a functional T [w, g, g] where g is the (q + 1) × q
Jacobian matrix of g.
Theorem 4: Assume that Condition 1 is satisﬁed, then

*Note: The optimal distribution takes probability mass 1/3 at permutations

where PW belongs to P and g belongs to the class associated with P c . For the binary case (q = 2) under the
marking assumption (which is equivalent to RDM, UDM,
ADM, and GDM), the minimization problem of (12) can
be solved explicitly for ﬁxed PW using the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality, and the maximization problem can then be solved
using another Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Indeed since the
game of (12) has a convex payoff functional with respect
to g (analogous to Theorem 1), there exists a saddle-point
solution pair (P∗ , g∗ ), which are the arcsine distribution
W
and the interleaving attack for the binary case. They are the
maximizing and minimizing strategies for the capacity game
[5].
For the nonbinary case under the combined digit model,
the Cauchy-Schwarz trick does not yield the analytic solution
in general. However, the convexity of the payoff functional
and the saddle-point property still hold, and we can solve the
problem using variational calculus. A set of Euler-Lagrange
differential equations can be explicitly speciﬁed as necessary
and sufﬁcient conditions, and saddle-point solutions can be
obtained either analytically or numerically.

Sketch of the proof: Applying Lemma 1 by letting F =

theorem by applying Lemma 2.
Corollary 1: We consider RDM and the uniform distribu∗
tion PV on V q . The identity mapping h∗ (v) = v is the unique
∗
minimizer of (17). Moreover, (PV , h∗ ) is the saddle-point
solution pair to the maximin problem of (14).
Remark 1: Changing variables v and h back to w and g,
it is easy to verify that h∗ = v corresponds to the interleaving
∗
attack g∗ = w, and the uniform distribution of Pv corresponds
−1/2
∗
to Pw ∝
which is the Jeffreys’ prior for the

we deﬁne V q the manifold of points on the unit hypersphere in
the ﬁrst hyperoctant {v : v 2 = 1 and 0 ≤ vx ≤ 1, x ∈ X },
then v ∈ V q and h : V q → V q+1 . We need to solve the
