Abstract—We explore the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the
K > 3 user MT × MR MIMO Gaussian interference channel where each transmitter is equipped with MT and each
receiver is equipped with MR antennas. Expressing the DoF
characterization as a function of the ratio γ = M/N , where
M = min(MT , MR ) and N = max(MT , MR ), we ﬁnd that when
K−1
γ ≤ γo = K(K−2) = γo , the DoF value per user is piecewise
linear depending on M and N alternately, similar to the DoF
characterization for K = 3 which has been previously obtained.
The regime γ > γo , which is the dominant regime for K > 3
users and is not encountered in the K = 3 user setting, is the
main focus of this paper. Our DoF results in this regime are
obtained through a novel “genie chains” approach, which is the
main contribution of this work. It is a chain of mappings from
genie signals provided to a receiver to the exposed signal spaces
at that receiver, which then serve as the genie signals for the
next receiver in the chain, until an acceptable genie with the
required number of dimensions is obtained, essentially converting
an information theoretic problem into a linear algebra problem.

II. S YSTEM M ODEL AND D EFINITIONS
Consider a fully connected K user MIMO interference
channel where there are MT and MR antennas at each
transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), respectively, each TX
sending one independent message to its desired RX. Denote
by H [ji] the MR × MT channel matrix from TX i to RX
j where i, j ∈ K {1, · · · , K}. For simplicity, we assume
that the channel coefﬁcients are independently drawn from
continuous distributions. While our results are valid regardless
of whether the channel coefﬁcients are constant or varying
in time/frequency, we assume the channels are constant in
the exposition. Global channel knowledge is assumed to be
available at all nodes.
At time index t ∈ Z+ , TX i sends a complex-valued
MT ×1 signal vector X[i] (t), which satisﬁes an average power
T

constraint T t=1 E[ X[i] (t) 2 ] ≤ ρ for T channel uses. At
the receiver side, RX j observes an MR × 1 signal vector
Y[j] (t) at time index t, which is given by:

I. I NTRODUCTION
The information theoretic degrees of freedom (DoF) characterization of MIMO interference networks is a key objective in
the quest for understanding the mathematical nature of spatial
signal dimensions. Starting with the DoF characterization for
the 2 user arbitrary MIMO interference channel [5], intermediate successes along this path have included the K user
symmetric MIMO setting [6], the K user SIMO and MISO settings and their spatially scaled versions [1], the K user semisymmetric MIMO setting with sufﬁciently large number of
users relative to the number of antennas [2], and most recently
the 3 user semi-symmetric MIMO interference channel [3].
The DoF characterization for the 3 user setting in particular,
comprised of a piece-wise linear mapping with inﬁnitely many
linear intervals over the range of the parameter γ (the ratio of
numbers of transmit antennas and receiver antennas per user),
sheds light on several interesting elements such as redundant
dimensions, decomposability, subspace alignment chains and
feasibility of linear interference alignment. However, it is not
clear if the insights from the 3 user setting generalize to more
than 3 users. Indeed, as we show in this work, the 3 user setting
represents more of an exception than a rule in many aspects.
As we ﬁnd out here, the DoF characterization for the K = 4
user setting, which is in sharp contrast with the K = 3 setting,
is actually representative of all network size values, K > 4,
as well.

where Z[j] (t) is an MR ×1 column vector representing the i.i.d.
circularly symmetric complex additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) at RX j, each entry of which is an i.i.d. Gaussian
random variable with zero-mean and unit-variance.
Let Rk (ρ) = R(ρ) denote the symmetric achievable rate of
each user where ρ is referred to as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR). We deﬁne d(K, MT , MR )
limρ→∞ R(ρ)/ log ρ
as the symmetric DoF per user. Here, the user index k is
interpreted modulo K so that, e.g., User 1 is the same as User
K +1, etc. The dependence on K, MT , MR may be dropped
for compact notation when no ambiguity would be caused.
Notations: We use A to denote a matrix or column vector.
Also, we use A or A to represent the |A| dimensional space
spanned by its column vectors where |A| is the number of
columns in A. For two subspaces A, B, we denote by A \
B = A ∩ (A ∩ B)c the intersection of A with the null space
of A ∩ B. Moreover, we use o(x) to represent any function
f (x) such that limx→∞ f (x)/x = 0. Furthermore, we deﬁne
M = min(MT , MR ), N = max(MT , MR ).

A list of some easy to prove properties is provided next,

3b) h(L[1] |L[2] ) = h((X \ L[2] )|L[2] ).
The meaning of these properties should be intuitively clear.
For example, property (2) states that the entropy of a vector

simply states that the M variables X can be reconstructed from
generic sets of linear equations as long as the total number of

veriﬁed, because adding h(L[2] ) to each side of the equation
gives us h(X) on each side.

are set to zero. This is meaningful because the receiver is
always guaranteed to be able to reliably decode, and therefore
subtract out, its desired signals, leaving it with a view of only
the interference subspace from which it may attempt to resolve
undesired signal dimensions.
A. The 4 Ideas Comprising the Genie Chains Approach
The starting point of our outer bound is the common
principle of providing a receiver enough additional linear
combinations of transmitted symbols to allow it to resolve
all of the interferers, so that subject to noise distortion (which
is inconsequential for DoF), it can decode all messages. In
general, because we are proving a converse, which means that
we start with a reliable coding scheme, a receiver is already
guaranteed to reliably decode its desired message, which
also allows the receiver to subtract its desired symbols from
its received signal. Now, the question remains whether the
receiver can decode all messages. With N receive antennas,
and 3M > N undesired symbols, we have fewer equations
and more unknowns, so that resolution of symbols is not
guaranteed. So, we provide 3M − N genie dimensions, i.e.,
|G| = 3M−N independent linear combinations of interference
symbols. This provides the receiver enough equations to resolve all transmitted symbols. Equivalently, the undesired X[i]
are now invertible (within noise distortion) from the receiver’s
own observations combined with the genie dimensions. Since
noise distortion is irrelevant for DoF arguments, the ability to
resolve all symbols is equivalent to the ability to decode all
symbols for DoF purposes. This forms the general basis for
the outer bound, and is so far not a novel concept at all.
The challenging aspect, and where the novelty of our
approach comes in, is to determine which genie dimensions
to provide so that a useful DoF outer bound results. We
propose a series of steps where we continue to cycle through
various receivers in a chain of genie aided outer bounds
containing entropies of various vector subspaces, following
4 basic principles, that lead us eventually to a cancelation
of all subspace entropy terms, producing the desired outer
bound. The 4 basic principles of the “genie chain” approach
are highlighted next through the simplest examples.
Idea 1: Use the exposed space from one receiver as a
genie for the next.
Example 1: (M, N ) = (2, 5) ⇒ d ≤ 10/7
In this example, |G| = 3M − N = 1, so we need to
provide a 1 dimensional genie. Suppose we start with the
[1]
generic subspace X(1) as the genie for RX 2. Since this genie
allows the receiver to decode all messages, we have the Fano’s
inequality:

K−1
Here we will focus on K = 4 and M/N > K(K−2) = 3/8.
Our goal is to show the information theoretic DoF outer
MN
bound d ≤ M +N . We will propose a systematic approach,
labeled the“genie chains” approach, based on four central
ideas. To keep the presentation intuitive and compact, we
need additional terminology, speciﬁcally the notion of exposed
subspaces and some notations for generic subspaces and the
interference subspaces available to a receiver after decoding
and removing its desired signals.
Exposed Subspace: An exposed subspace, e.g., from TX1
at RX2, denoted as X[1∼2] refers to the linear equations
containing only X[1] variables, that are obtained at RX2 after
subtracting all desired signal variables (for RX2 this would
be X[2] ), and zero forcing (i.e., projecting into the null space,
or simply using Gaussian elimination to remove) the other
interferers (in this case X[3] , X[4] ). For example, consider the
exposed space X[1∼2] in the (M, N ) = (2, 5) setting. At RX2,
after removing desired signals X[2] , we have 5 equations in 6
variables X[1] , X[3] , X[4] (Since M = 2, each X[k] represents
2 variables). Eliminating 4 variables, X[3] , X[4] , leaves us with
1 equation in the two variables X[1] . This remaining linear
equation, containing only variables X[1] is the exposed space
from TX1 at RX2, i.e., X[1∼2] . The dimensionality of the
[1∼2]
exposed space may be indicated with a subscript, e.g., X1
in this example.
Generic Subspace: The notion of a generic subspace has
been deﬁned previously. Here we introduce only the notation.
[k]
We use X(m) to denote an m-dimensional generic subspace
[k]

of the M -dimensional vector space X[k] . Basically, X(m)
consists of m random linear combinations of the M variables
comprising X[k] .
Interference Subspace: We use the notation S[k] to refer to
the received signal at RX k, after the desired variables X[k]

+no(log(ρ))+no(n)

and switching to our compact notation we have:

(4)

Note that the exposed space has appeared as a negative entropy
term. As a rule, in our approach, the negative entropy terms
will become the genie signals for the subsequent bounds,
leading to their eventual cancellation. Also, we will use a
total of M bounds. In this case, M = 2, so we move to
our ﬁnal bound, and to the next receiver, RX 3. The genie,
as just mentioned, will be the previous negative entropy term

Now, the required size of the genie is |G| = 3M −N = 1
and exposed spaces have size 2. How to create a smaller genie?
We will do that by creating multiple exposed spaces, each of
which may be too big to be an acceptable genie, but their
intersection will turn out to be an acceptable genie.
A genie provides to RX 3 another random linear combina[1]
tion of X[1] , i.e, G2 = X(1) , so that we have
[1∼3]

4d ≤ 8 + d − h(X2

)

(18)

[1∼3]
X2

is the original two dimensional exposed
where O =
[1∼2]
space of TX 1 at RX 3. Since the construction of O = X2
and O only involve the channel coefﬁcients associated with
their own receivers, they are generic and have only 2+2−3 =
1 dimensional intersection, denoted as I = O ∩ O . Thus, we
can rewrite (18) as:

(8)

(11)

(9)

[1∼3]

4d ≤ 8 + d − h(X2
= 8+
= 8+

Now, with the additional exposed dimension, the exposed
[2∼3]
is two-dimensional and matches the desired size
space X2
of the genie. This gives us our third, and ﬁnal, bound as we
cyclically move on to the next receiver, RX 4, with the genie
[2∼3]
. Since the channel coefﬁcients associated with
G3 = X 2
RX 4 are generic, the one dimensional observation available
at RX 4 from TX 2 is linear independent with G3 . Thus, RX
4 can decode all messages, and we have
)

(16)

Remark: Idea 3 is especially useful in the MT > MR settings.
Idea 4: Obtain a smaller size genie by intersections.
Example 3: (M, N ) = (3, 8) ⇒ d ≤ 24/11
[1]
Starting with a generic genie G1 = X(1) at RX 2, we have
the ﬁrst inequality:

Adding up the three inequalities above, we again obtain

For the next bound, we move to RX 3. We will use the genie
[1∼2]
,
corresponding to the previous negative entropy term, X1
but since this is only one dimensional and we need 2 genie
dimensions, we will complement it with a random dimension
[2]
from the next transmitter, X(1) .
The most important element here is how a new dimension
gets exposed. RX 3 originally has one exposed dimension
[1∼2]
from TX 2, X[2] . However, when the genie provides X1
,
it exposes one additional dimension from TX 2, so that the
[2∼3]
.
new exposed space from TX 2 is denoted as X2
The resulting bound is the following:

Finally, a genie provides G 3 = {X1

space after RX 4 removes its desired signal. Thus, RX 4 can
decode all messages as well. So we have:

. Thus, we have:

Remark: The (M, N ) = (2, 5) example is perhaps a bit
serendipitous because the size of the exposed space exactly
matches the required size of the genie at the next receiver. In
general, the two will not be the same, and we need to create
either a bigger or a smaller genie. How to achieve a larger or
smaller genie is the subject of the remaining three ideas.
Idea 2: Obtain a larger genie by exposing more dimensions.
Example 2: (M, N ) = (3, 7) ⇒ d ≤ 21/10
In this example, |G| = 3M −N = 2 so we need 2 genie
dimensions, but N − 2M = 1, so the exposed space, e.g.,
X[1∼2] is only 1 dimensional. Similar to Example 1, we start
[1]
with a generic genie at RX 2 G1 = X(2) , which is trivially
linearly independent with X1

(13)

In the following we provide an alternative proof for this
example to shed light on the following idea.
Idea 3: Combine exposed subspaces from multiple receivers to create a larger genie.
After obtaining (7) at RX 2, similarly if a genie provides to
[1]
RX 3 two random linear combination of X[1] , i.e, G2 = X(2) ,
we can have another inequality at RX 3:

to recover the signal from TX k. This process produces
one sum DoF inequality 4d ≤ N + d + h(O). Adding up
all inequalities that we have so far produces the desired
bound. Then we stop.
• Step 4:
[k]
A genie provides G = {X[k+2] , O, X(M −M0 −|O|) } to
RX k+1. In the absence of interference from TX k + 2,
RX k+1 originally has M0 dimensional observations of
TX k, denoted as O . Since providing O to RX k + 1
releases other M0 observations of TX k, which is denoted
¯
¯
as O, RX k + 1 has a total of |O| + M0 dimensional
[k]
observations of X . This process produces the inequality

O = {O,
• Step 5:
[k]
A genie provides G = {O, X(2M −M0 −|O|) } to RX k+1.
In the N dimensional space S[k+1] , after zero-forcing the
interference from TX k −2, we still have N −M = M0
observations of the interference from TX k −1 and TX
k. After providing O to RX k +1, we continue to zero
force the remaining M −|O| dimensional observations of
X[k−1] , thus only leaving M0−(M−|O|) dimensional observations of X[k] , denoted as O . Note that O is linearly
[k]
independent with X(2M −M0 −|O|) provided by the genie,
and they together contribute a total of d DoF. This process
produces the inequality 4d ≤ N +h(O)+d−h(O ). Now
we update O = O and k = k + 1. Go back to Step 2.
Finally, adding up all the inequalities that we have produces
the desired DoF outer bound.
Remark: Note that we do not need the intermediate DoF
outer bound in this case. In contrast, for M/N ∈ [2/5, 1/2)
and [3/8, 2/5) cases the intermediate bound is necessary, as
we have shown in Example 3.

inequality (25) the “intermediate bound” which is constructed
by intersecting two subspaces at different receivers.
Finally, we should provide the observations we obtain in the
last step as the genie to RX 4, i.e., G3 = I. Since G3 only
involves the channel coefﬁcients associated with RX 2 and 3,
it is linearly independent with the original two dimensional
observations from TX 1 at RX 4. Thus, RX 4 can decode all
messages, and we have the last inequality:
4d ≤ 8 + h(I).

Adding up the inequalities (17), (25) and (26) we have
12d ≤ 3N + d ⇒ d ≤ 3N/11 = 24/11.

The three examples above show that our goal is to use a
chain of arguments, where we start with the exposed spaces
and continue to build new genies with more dimensions by
peeling off overlaps, or less dimensions by taking intersections, until we have the genie of the correct size, which
MN
requires exactly M steps, and produces the bound d ≤ M +N ,
if all genies in this process are acceptable, i.e., linearly
independent of the space already available to the receivers.
Next, we will sketch the outlines of the general proofs
through three speciﬁc algorithms for M/N ∈ [3/8, 1]. Due
to the space limitation, we only present the algorithm for the
M/N ∈ [1/2, 1] setting next. The algorithms for the other two
intervals M/N ∈ [2/5, 1/2) and [3/8, 2/5) can be similarly
constructed based on the 4 ideas highlighted in the paper, and
we defer them to [4]. Therefore, we covers the entire region
where decomposable inner bound is DoF optimal.
B. M/N ∈ [1/2, 1] Case
Since N − 2M ≤ 0, each receiver cannot directly obtain
exposed subspaces from any interferer by zero forcing the
signals from the other two interferers. For brevity we let
M0 = N −M where M0 is a positive integer. Also, note that
the random linear combinations provided by a genie in each
step are generic, although we may use the same notations.
Algorithm 1: (M/N ∈ [1/2, 1])
• Step 1:
Start from RX k = 2. A genie provides to RX k the
[k−1]
[k−1]
set G = {X[k+1] , X(M −M0 ) }, where X(M−M0 ) are M −
M0 random linear combinations from TX k − 1. In the
absence of the interference from TX k + 1, RX k has
M0 dimensional observations from TX k−1, denoted as
O. This process produces the ﬁrst sum DoF inequality
4d ≤ N + 2d − h(O).
• Step 2:
If |O| = |G| − M = M − M0 , go to Step 3.
If |O| < |G| − M = M − M0 , go to Step 4.
If |O| > |G| − M = M − M0 , go to Step 5.
• Step 3:
A genie provides to RX k+1 the set G = {X[k+2] , O}.
Note that in the absence of interference from TX k+2 and
after zero-forcing the interference from TX k+3, RX k+
1 originally has M0 dimensional observations of TX k,
denoted as O , which combined with the |O| dimensional
