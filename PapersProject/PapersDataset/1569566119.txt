as a straight forward extension of the 2-user case. We show
that while the sum-rate of the 2-user Gaussian IC-CR scales
as 2 log(P ) as the transmit power P → ∞, the K > 2 user
case scales as 2K log(P ). In other words, the 2-user case does
3
not follow the same law as the K > 2 user case. This DoF
is shown to be achievable using interference alignment as in
a K-user 2 × 1 MISO IC [9]. Thus we give a characterization
of the DoF of the K-user Gaussian IC-CR with time varying
channel coefﬁcients. It turns out that the per user DoF of the
K-user Gaussian IC-CR drop from 1 to 2/3 as we go from the
K = 2 to K > 2. This is in contrast to the K-user IC, where
the per-user DoF is 1/2 for all K ≥ 2. We also consider the
constant channel case, for which we obtain the DoF region of
the 3-user Gaussian IC-CR.
As a result, in contrast to [4], where it was shown that causal
relays can not increase the DoF of the wireless network, a
cognitive relay can increase the DoF of the K-user IC from
K/2 to 2K/3 with K > 2. Moreover, the results of this
paper give an example where cognition/relaying can help in
increasing the DoF of a wireless network.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II,
we give the general model of the K-user IC-CR. In section III,
we consider the time varying IC-CR and characterize its DoF,
and in section IV we consider the IC-CR with constant channel
coefﬁcients, where we give a new sum-rate upper bound for
the 2-user case and characterize the DoF region of the 3-user
case. Finally, we conclude in section V.

Abstract—It was shown recently that the 2-user interference
channel with a cognitive relay (IC-CR) has full degrees of freedom
(DoF) almost surely, that is, 2 DoF. The purpose of this work is
to check whether the DoF of the K-user IC-CR, consisting of
K user pairs and a cognitive relay, follow as a straight forward
extension of the 2-user case. As it turns out, this is not the case.
The K-user IC-CR is shown to have 2K/3 DoF if K > 2 for the
when the channel is time varying, achievable using interference
alignment. Thus, while the basic K-user IC with time varying
channel coefﬁcients has 1/2 DoF per user for all K, the K-user
IC-CR with varying channels has 1 DoF per user if K = 2 and
2/3 DoF per user if K > 2. Furthermore, the DoF region of
the 3-user IC-CR with constant channels is characterized using
interference neutralization, and a new upper bound on the sumcapacity of the 2-user IC-CR is given.

I. I NTRODUCTION
One of the approaches for approximating the capacity of
interference networks is ﬁnding the multiplexing gain. The
multiplexing gain, also known as the capacity pre-log or
degrees of freedom (DoF), characterizes the capacity of the
network at an asymptotically high signal-to-noise ratio. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in characterizing
the DoF of interference networks, e.g, the K-user IC [1] and
the X Channel [2], [3].
Besides the IC and the X channel, relaying setups have
also been studied from DoF point of view. For instance, [4]
studies the impact of relays on wireless networks and shows
that causal relays do not increase the DoF of the network.
Non-causal relays, on the other hand, can increase the DoF.
In [5], achievable rate regions and upper bounds for the 2user IC with a cognitive relay (IC-CR) were given, and it was
shown the interference channel with a cognitive relay has full
DoF, i.e., 2 DoF. The cognitive IC has also been studied in
[6]–[8] where capacity results for some cases were given, in
addition to new upper and lower bounds.
The question we try to answer in this paper is: How is
the behavior of the DoF of the IC-CR with K users? A
straight forward extension of the results of [5] suggest that
the K-user IC-CR has K DoF. The goal of this paper is
the characterization of the DoF for general K. Namely, we
consider the effect of a cognitive relay on the DoF of the Kuser IC. We study the K-user Gaussian IC-CR, and obtain the
DoF of this channel under time varying channel coefﬁcients
assumption.
It turns out that the case with K > 2 users does not follow

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
The K-user Gaussian interference channel with a cognitive
relay (IC-CR) is shown in Figure 1. It consists of K transmitreceive pairs and a cognitive relay, each with one antenna.
For k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, source k has a message mk ∈ Mk
{1, . . . , 2nRk } to be sent to destination k over n channel uses.
The messages mk are independent, uniformely distributed over
the messages sets, and are made available non-causally at the
relay. At each time instant (i), the output of the channel can
be represented as follows
K

hjk (i)Xj (i) + hrk (i)Xr (i) + Zk (i),

Yk (i) =
j=1

where Xr , Xk ∈ R, k = 1, . . . , K, are the channel inputs
and Yk ∈ R is the channel output, Zk is an independent

A. A Sum-capacity Upper Bound for the 2-User Gaussian ICCR
The 2-User Gaussian IC-CR with constant channel coefﬁcients was considered in [5], where achievable rate regions,
upper bounds, and the DoF region were given. The same DoF
upper bound as in [5] holds for the time varying case. That is
d1 + d2 ≤ 2.

We ﬁrst consider the case K = 3. The DoF upper bound

when extended to the 3-user case. However, as we show next,
this straight forward extension is not tight since the DoF of the
3-user IC-CR is upper bounded by 2. In the following lemma,
we give a DoF upper bound for the 3-user IC-CR.

and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise with zero mean and
unit variance Zk ∼ N (0, 1), and hjk (i) and hrk (i) represent
time varying channel gains from source j and the relay to
destination k, respectively. The channels are assumed to be
known apriori at all nodes, and are i.i.d. and drawn from a
continuous distribution. The IC-CR with constant channels is
deﬁned in the same way as above, with the exception that
hjk (i1 ) = hjk (i2 ) and hrk (i1 ) = hrk (i2 ) for all i1 , i2 ∈ N.
The inputs satisfy the following power constraint
2
E[Xj ] ≤ P,

∀j ∈ {1, . . . , K, r}.

Lemma 1. The DoF of the 3-user IC-CR is upper bounded
by
d1 + d2 + d3 ≤ 2.
Proof: See Appendix A.
The 3-user Gaussian IC-CR DoF upper bound can be used
to obtain the DoF upper bound for the K-user Gaussian IC-CR
with K ≥ 3 stated in the following theorem.

The transmitters and the relay use encoding functions to map
n
the messages to codewords Xk = (Xk (1), . . . , Xk (n)) and
n
Xr = (Xr (1) . . . , Xr (n)), respectively. The receivers want to
n
decode their desired messages from their received signals Yk
which induces an error probability. A rate tuple (R1 , . . . , RK )
is said to be achievable if the error probability can be made
arbitrarily small by increasing the code length n. The closure
of the set of all achievable rate tuples deﬁnes the capacity
region C.
K
An achievable sum-rate is deﬁned as RΣ = k=1 Rk with
(R1 , . . . , Rk ) ∈ C and the sum-capacity CΣ is the maximum
sum-rate. The sum DoF is deﬁned as

Proof: Using Lemma 1, we have: dj + dk + dl ≤ 2, for
all distinct j, k, l ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Adding all such inequalities,
we obtain K−1 dΣ ≤ 2 K , and the result follows.

C. Achievability of the K-User IC-CR DoF
Consider the following achievable scheme in a K-user
Gaussian IC-CR. At time instant i, the message mk , k ∈
[1]
[2]
{1, . . . , K}, is mapped to a vector xk (i) = [xk (i), xk (i)]T ,
the ﬁrst component of which is sent from Tx 1 and the second
component is sent from the relay. The overall relay signal is

xr (i) = k=1 xk (i) and the received signals at receiver j
can be written as:

In this section, we study the DoF of the K-user IC-CR. We

in more details afterwards.

hkj (i) = [hkj (i), hrj (i)]T .

(6)

Therefore, we can model the IC-CR with this scheme as a Kuser 2 × 1 MISO IC with time varying channel coefﬁcients.
Since the relay sends the sum of K signals, we guarantee that
the power constraint at each node of the IC-CR is satisﬁed by
deﬁning the power constraint of the resulting MISO channel
to be P/K at each node. Notice that this power scaling does
not reduce the achievable DoF.
It was shown in [9] that using interference alignment in a
K-user 2 × 1 MISO interference channel with time varying

Theorem 1. The DoF of the K-user IC-CR with time varying
channel coefﬁcients is given by

if K > 2

The proof of this theorem is given in the following subsections. We consider the 2-user case ﬁrst, and then the K-user
case, and derive upper bounds on the DoF. Then we provide
the achievability of these upper bounds.

channel coefﬁcients, 2 DoF are achievable if K = 2, and 2K
3
DoF are achievable if K > 2. It is important to note that by
the reciprocity of interference alignment [10], the same DoF is
achievable in the SIMO IC (with the same physical channels).
Here, we use the same scheme as in [9] for our setup, i.e.,
we make use of reciprocity. We consider the reciprocal 1 ×
2 K-user SIMO IC with the physical channels given by the
2 × 1 MISO IC interpretation of the IC-CR given in (5). In
this SIMO IC, the channel from transmitter j to receiver k is
hkj (i). Notice here the special structure of the SIMO channel
vectors: the second component of hjj (i) is the same as hkj (i)
(see (6))
Now, as in [9], we consider µn symbol extensions of the
channel. This makes the 1×2 SIMO IC and extended µn ×2µn
SIMO IC, where the channel matrix from Tx j to Rx k is
2µn × µn and has a block diagonal structure

Now for the general SIMO IC, the construction of Vk given
in [9] also satisﬁes (9) since their design of Vk is independent
of the direct channels Hkk which are generated randomly and
independently of all other channels. In our case, we should
examine this more carefully, since we have some dependency
in the channels given by
Hkk (2m, m) = Hkj (2m, m), m = 1, 2, . . .
where Hkj (a, b) is the component in the a-th row and bth column of Hkj . The design of Vk is not completely
independent of Hkk in our case. However, let us write Hkk
as follows
Hkk = Hkk + Hkk
where

where 02×1 is the all-zero vector of length 2. Notice that
hkj (i2 ) and hkj (i2 ) are independent. User j ∈ T1 = {1, 2, 3}

In this section, we focus on the IC-CR with constant channel
coefﬁcients. We give a new sum-rate upper bound for the 2user IC-CR. The DoF upper bounds in section III are general
and still hold in this case. However, what differs is that
achievable scheme. In what follows, we give an upper bound
on the sum-rate of the 2-user case, and we characterize the
DoF region of the 3-user case.

[9], where Vk is given as a function of all Hkj , j = k. By
choosing Uk to be the null space of the subspace spanned by
the interference, we satisfy (10).

Here, dk denotes the dimension of the subspace spanned by
¯
the desired signal at Rx k. Denote by dk the dimension of the
subspace spanned by all the interfering signals arriving at Rx

dimensions of the overall 2µn -dimenstional receive space to

Then, the construction of Vk is clearly independent of

rank(Uk Hkk Vk ) = dk almost surely and hence condition (9)

is satisﬁed. This achieves 3 2 µn + (K − 3) 3 − ǫn µn

consequence (due to reciprocity), by using Vj and Uj as postcoding and pre-coding matrices at Rx j and Tx j in the original
MISO IC, respectively, we achieve 2K/3 DoF. Thus the DoF
upper bounds (2) and (4) are achievable using interference
alignment.

As in [9], we choose V1 = V2 = V3 and V4 = V5 = · · · = VK .

V. C ONCLUSION
We studied the K-user Gaussian interference channel with
a cognitive relay. For the 2-user case, we have obtained a
new upper bound on the sum-capacity. In the general K-user
case with time varying channel coefﬁcients, we characterized
the DoF. We have shown that while for K = 2, the setup
has 2 DoF, for K > 2 users the DoF are upper bounded by
2K/3. Moreover 2K/3 DoF are achievable using interference
alignment when the channels are time varying. We notice that
the DoF per user is more compared to that in the K-user IC,
where we have 1/2 DoF per user. Thus, a cognitive relay can
increase the DoF of the IC. We notice also a decrease in the
per-user DoF for the K-user case from 1 to 2/3 as we go from
K = 2 to K > 2. We also considered the case with constant
channel coefﬁcients, where we gave the DoF region for the
3-user case and showed that it is achievable using interference
neutralization.

B. The 3-User Gaussian IC-CR with constant channel coefﬁcients
The sum DoF upper bound in Lemma 1 still holds in this
case. Thus
d1 + d2 + d3 ≤ 2.
In the following theorem, we give the DoF region of the 3-user
IC-CR with constant channel coefﬁcients.

Theorem 4. The DoF region D of the 3-user Gaussian IC-CR
is given by

then d1 + d2 + d3 = 3.

The statement of this theorem is obtained by giving
(Y1n , m1 ) as side information to receiver 2 and using classical
information theoretic approaches. In [5, Theorem 4], it was
shown that d1 + d2 satisﬁes (13), and that this upper bound is
indeed achievable using interference neutralization [11]. The
sum-rate upper bound in Theorem 3 combines the two DoF
cases in one expression. We notice a collapse of the DoF to
1 under the special conditions in (13). With random channel
realizations, the condition under which d1 +d2 = 1 constitutes
a set of measure zero. Thus the 2-user IC-CR with constant
channel coefﬁcients has 2 DoF almost surely achievable using
interference neutralization.

the corner points of this region, i.e. the points (1, 0, 0),(0, 1, 0),
and (0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), and (0, 1, 1) are all achievable,
the former three corners by keeping two users silent, and
the latter three corners by keeping one user silent and using
interference neutralization as in the 2-user IC-CR, the whole
region is achievable by time sharing, and the statement of the
theorem follows.

Gaussian IC-CR.
In some special cases, the 3-user Gaussian IC-CR has 3
