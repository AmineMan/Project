We analyse two transmission strategies using sequential
random codes [2]. We ﬁrst consider both source and channel
coding at the relay. A maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder is
not analytically tractable in this case, we therefore propose
and analyse a suboptimal message-truncating decoder. Alternatively, we consider a system without any source-coding at
the relay and an approximate ML decoder. Despite lacking a
source code, the system with the approximate ML decoder
outperforms the system with message-truncating decoder in
most cases. Particularly, when the source-relay channel is
symmetric, or when the relay-destination link is good, the
gains provided by source coding are not sufﬁcient to offset
the loss of suboptimal decoding. When the relay-destination
link is noisy, source coding may offer substantial gains in
delay-exponent, even with the suboptimal message-truncating
decoder. Apart from the achievable bounds for the delayexponent of relay networks, the analysis gives informative
guidelines for system design: whether to omit the source code
to facilitate high-performance decoder at the destination, or to
use source code and accept a suboptimal decoder.

Abstract—We study compress-and-forward relaying for delayuniversal transmission over a three-terminal network. An important performance measure of delay-universal transmission is the
delay-exponent. Two achievable bounds of the delay-exponent are
derived. The delay-exponent achieved by a suboptimal messagetruncating decoder is inferior to that achieved by an approximate
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder in most cases. However, ML
decoding is not analytically tractable when source compression
is employed at the relay terminal. Therefore, the system with
the message-truncating decoder performs better when signal
compression is essential, for e.g. when the source-relay link is
non-symmetric and the relay-destination link is noisy.
Index Terms—Delay-universal, compress-and-forward relaying, error-exponent, transmission for control.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Delay-universal transmission has been shown as an essential
requirement for controlling/tracking unstable systems through
noisy channels [1]. Different from classical block transmission
where decoding can only be performed when the whole codeword has been received, delay-universal transmission requires
that information symbols can be recovered after any delay, and
that their reliability increases with delay. An important performance measures of delay-universal transmission is the delayexponent, which is the exponential rate that error probability
decays with delay. The achievable delay-exponent has been
characterised for point-to-point channels in [2] and for lossless
source compression in [3, 4]. Further works has extended the
results to the broadcast and multiple access channels [5–7]. In
these results, the achievable delay-exponent is closely related
to the classical Gallager’s error-exponent [8].
Despite the aforementioned works, limited results are available for relaying networks. An achievable delay-exponent has
been derived for the two-hop erasure network, where no direct
link is available [9]. Reference [10] proposes a decode-andforward scheme that can achieve the optimal random-code
delay-exponent when errors are detected at the relay, for e.g.
when the source-relay link is an erasure channel. On the other
hand, when the relay terminal cannot decode the message, a
feasible strategy is to compress the relay’s received signal with
a source encoder, protect the compressed signal with a channel
code and forward it to the destination. In this work, we limit
ourselves to lossless compression at the relay terminal.

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
Consider delay-universal transmission over a discrete memoryless three-terminal relaying network. Information available
at the source terminal is encoded and transmitted over the
discrete memoryless channel (DMC) Wy,z|x , where x is the
channel input, y, z are the channel outputs at the destination
and relay terminals correspondingly. The relay terminal processes and forwards its received signal to the destination over
an independent DMC Wy|w , where w and y are correspondingly the channel input and output. The destination attempts to
recover the source information based on the received signals.
In delay-universal transmission, information sequence is
available in real-time at the source terminal. At each time
instant t, information symbol st arrives and a new coded
symbol xt is produced from the following encoding function
s
Et : S t → X ;

s
Et (st ) = xt ,

where xt ∈ X is the signal transmitted by the source terminal.
The information rate is R = ln |S| nats per unit time. In
this paper, we consider random tree codes studied in [2]

where xt = Et (st ) ∈ X has distribution Qx (xt ) and xt is

The relay sequentially forwards its received sequence to the

In this paper, we analyse the achievable performance of

Characterising the delay-exponent, and error-exponent in
general, of relaying networks remains an open problem. For
decode-and-forward relaying, large delay is needed for reliable
decoding the message at the relay; however, relayed messages
with larger delay are less useful in delay-constrained applications [10]. Reference [10] only tackles the challenge for
systems where error can be detected at the relay. Similarly in
CF relaying, the non-reliability of the relayed message posses
the main challenge for delay-exponent analysis.
In this section, we derive the delay-exponent achieved by
CF relaying. Recall that the destination decoder attempts to
t
recover the information sequence st based on the symbols y1
1
received from the source terminal and an unreliable represent
tation z1 of the relay message z1 . In systems with both source
ˆt
and channel codes at the relay, the optimal ML decoding is not
tractable. We therefore propose a message-truncating decoder

The delay-exponent has been characterised for point-topoint delay universal transmission [2].

delay-universal
transmission over a DMC Wy|x (y|x), x ∈ X , y ∈ Y using
random tree codes with coded symbol distribution Qx (x).
The probability of error at delay d is bounded by

in Section IV-A, which simply truncates and discard the less
reliable part of the sequence z1 . For systems without a source
ˆt
code at the relay, we propose and analyse an approximate
to the optimal ML decoder in Section IV-B. As we shall
see, the approximate ML decoder usually outperforms despite
lacking a source code. However, when zt is not equiprobable,
source coding may provide substantial gains, even with the
suboptimal message-truncating decoder.

Corollary 1: The achievable delay-exponent of CF relaying
over the network described in Section II is bounded by
E(R) ≥ max max
Qx

(12)
Proof: The error exponent is lower bounded by
Ec (R, Qx , Wy|x ), which is achieved by ignoring the relaying
stream. Furthermore, when d → ∞, optimising k/d in (9)
converges to optimising α ∈ [0, 1].

With both source and channel codes at the relay termit

consider an approximate to ML decoding. For tractability,
we only consider systems without source-coding at the relay

each channel use on the source transmitter.
Figure 2 illustrates the achievable delay exponents when the

optimal to relay z1 to the destination, and thus the approximate
ML decoder performs close to optimality. This observation is
clearly illustrated in Figure 2 where Eml (R) is close to the

However, when the relay-destination link degrades, the
delay-exponent achieved by approximate ML decoding diverges from the upper bound Ec (R, Wy,z|x ). Figure 3 illustrates the achievable delay-exponent at R = 0.2 for various
transition probability y of the relay-destination link. The
gaps between Eml (R) and Ec (R, Wy,z|x ) suggest that both
achievable delay-exponents Eml and Etr are signiﬁcantly
suboptimal, especially at large y . One possible method to
t
improve their performance is to lossily compress z1 prior to
relaying. Lossy compression is outside the scope of the paper.
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate that the approximate ML decoder
without source coding outperforms the message-truncating decoder. This observation is true for symmetric channels, where
source-coding at the relay does not bring signiﬁcant gains,
and thus the superior approximate ML decoder outperforms
the message-truncating decoder. However, when the channel

by the direct transmission delay-exponent Ec (R, Wy|x ) and

When a non-symmetric channel is observed at the relay
terminal, source-coding can signiﬁcantly reduces the rate requirements for the relay-destination link. However with source
coding, the ML decoding is not yet analytically tractable.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
We have derived achievable bounds for the delay-exponent
of CF relaying over a three-terminal network. Two transmission techniques are compared: a suboptimal destination
decoder with source-coding at the relay, and a near-optimal
destination decoder without source-coding at the relay. Our
analysis shows that the later scheme is superior to the former
one, except for networks with a non-symmetric source-relay
link and a bad relay-destination link. The analysis provides
guidelines for system design, highlighting how one should
tradeoff signal processing complexity between the transmitter
and the receiver in delay-universal relaying.

that y = 0.2. In this setting, Ec (ln |Z|, Wy|w ) ≈ 0, thus
it follows from Theorem 2 that the delay-exponent achieved
without source-coding is approximately that achieved by direct
transmission. Source-coding decreases the rate requirement for
the relay-destination link, leading to gains in the achievable
delay-exponent, even with a suboptimal destination decoder. In
Figure 4, the message-truncating method outperforms approximate ML decoding for R ≥ 0.1. Similarly in Figure 5, the
message-truncating method outperforms ML decoding without
