Abstract—Investigations on spatially coupled codes have lead
to the conjecture that, in the inﬁnite size limit, the average
input-output conditional entropy for spatially coupled low-density
parity-check ensembles, over binary memoryless symmetric channels, equals the entropy of the underlying individual ensemble.
We give a self-contained proof of this conjecture for the case
when the variable degrees have a Poisson distribution and all
check degrees are even. The ingredients of the proof are the
interpolation method and the Nishimori identities. We explain
why this result is an important step towards proving the Maxwell
conjecture in the theory of low-density parity-check codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Spatial coupling of graphical models has emerged as a useful design principle in order to construct graphical models that
show good performance under message-passing algorithms.
Two areas that have experienced signiﬁcant progress by using
spatial coupling are coding, see [1]–[3] and references therein,
and compressive sensing [4]–[7]. But there is also a large
literature on a variety of other graphical models and for each of
these models the same signiﬁcant improvement in performance
has been observed when going from the uncoupled to the
coupled model. For a more thorough review, we refer the
reader to [3].
The above examples all take advantage of the algorithmic
opportunities that spatial coupling provides. But there is a
second way in which spatial coupling of graphical models can
be useful, namely as a proof technique. The idea is to prove
a property of the underlying graph in the following way: (i)
prove that this property holds for the spatially coupled graph,
and (ii), show that the coupled and the uncoupled systems
behave in the same way (with respect to this property). Due
to the special nature of spatially coupled graphical models,
accomplishing step (i), i.e., proving the desired property for
the coupled system, is sometimes easier than for the uncoupled
one. Before we outline in more detail how we use spatial
coupling as a proof technique, let us introduce the underlying
problem.
We consider the so-called Maxwell conjecture. This conjecture states that the MAP threshold of an LDPC ensemble is equal to its area threshold. The area threshold is,
in turn, determined via the so-called BP-GEXIT curve. To
keep things simple, consider (l, r)-regular LDPC ensembles.
Figure 1 shows the case of the (3, 6)-regular LDPC ensemble
when transmission takes place over the BAWGN channel. It
is known, see [8, Theorem 3.120], that for regular degree

distributions the area threshold is an upper bound on the MAP
threshold, but it is more challenging to show a matching lower
bound. For a more thorough discussion of this conjecture, we
refer the reader to [8]–[10].
How can spatial coupling help to prove this conjecture,
i.e., to prove the missing lower bound? The idea is simple.
It was shown in [3] that both the MAP as well as the BP
threshold of spatially coupled ensembes are equal to the area
threshold (when the length of the chain and the connection
width tend to inﬁnity). Therefore, if we can show that the MAP
threshold of coupled ensembles is equal to the MAP threshold
of uncoupled ensembles then the Maxwell conjecture will have
been conﬁrmed.
Using the so called interpolation technique, in the form introduced in [11], we show the equality of the MAP thresholds
for coupled and uncoupled ensembles for the speciﬁc class
of LDPC ensembles with a check-regular degree distribution
and a Poisson distribution for the variable nodes. Why do we
consider this ensemble? The Poisson nature of the variable
degree distribution helps in the proof and so this is a natural
ﬁrst case to consider. But there is good reason to believe
that the same steps can also be carried through for regular
ensembles. Indeed, this is one of the main points slated for
future work. Assuming that this can indeed be accomplished,
this, together with the results in [3], will give a proof of the
Maxwell conjecture for all regular LDPC ensembles and all
binary-input memoryless and output-symmetric channels.
Although the present paper is only concerned with coding,

1

we remark that the basic idea of using spatial coupling as a
technique to prove properties of the underlying component
model might be applicable in a much broader context. It
remains to be seen whether this program can be carried out
successfully in other scenarios such as constraint satisfaction
problems, to answer questions such as the existence of phase
transitions or to improve upper and lower bounds.

where p(y|x) is the channel transition probability. It is easily
shown that h is a sufﬁcient statistic, i.e., it offers the same
amount of information on the prior x as the output y. For a
linear code G, one can easily show that

where by h · s we mean the dot product z∈ZL i=1 hz,i sz,i .
We denote this probability measure, called the Gibbs measure, by µG , and the average with respect to it by angular
brackets · (making the reference to h implicit), in order
to simplify notation and distinguish it from other types of
averages and expectations that will occur. The expectation
with respect to the channel will be denoted by Eh and the
one with respect to the LDPC ensemble will be of the form
Eens , where ens corresponds to the particular ensemble we
use. Note that these two expectations commute, since the
channel use is independent of the randomness in the ensemble.
The denominator that appears in (2) is denoted by ZG , the
1
partition function. The quantity fN,L,w = − N L Eens,h [log ZG ]
is the average free energy per node. It is related to the
average input-output conditional entropy of the code ensemble

hN,L,w = N L Eens [H(X|Y )] by the simple formula (see [12]
for a proof)

We consider coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) ensembles, constructed as follows. The variable nodes are distributed at L sites, with N variables at each site. Thus, there
are N L variables in total. The sites are indexed by elements
∆
of ZL = Z/LZ, i.e. lie on a periodic chain of size L.
The (1 − R)N L parity checks (R is the rate of the code)
always involve K variables, and are chosen randomly in the
following way. Independently for each parity check, a site z
is chosen uniformly at random, and we consider the group of
w ∈ {1, . . . , L} consecutive sites that start at site z, namely
z, z + 1, . . . , z + w − 1. We call this group (and all wN
variables lying at the sites in this group) a window and the
ﬁxed parameter w window size. The variables involved in the
parity check are chosen independently from each other and
uniformly at random from this window. In particular, we will
also consider the cases where w = L and w = 1. Note that
the random ensemble is completely speciﬁed by the numbers
N , L, K, R and w. Occasionally, we will ﬁnd it convenient
to think of codes as bipartite graphs, with N L variable nodes,
N L(1 − R) check nodes, check node degree K, with an edge
between a variable node and a check node if the variable
participates in the corresponding parity check.
Each variable is indexed by the site z to which it belongs
and by the position i ∈ {1, . . . , N } within the site. Its value
(0 or 1) will be denoted by xz,i and the whole variable
assignment by x = (xz,i ). Sometimes it will be useful to
work with values +1 and −1, which will be called spins, and
so we deﬁne sz,i = (−1)xz,i and accordingly s = (sz,i ).
Given a parity check n, we ﬁnd it convenient to denote the
variables it is connected to by n1 , . . . , nK . In this manner,
the fact that a variable assignment satisﬁes a parity check n
can be written as xn1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ xnK = 0 (where ⊕ denotes the
XOR operation) or in spin language as sn1 · . . . · snK = 1.
The local code Cn corresponding to a parity check n is the
set of all assignments that satisfy n; thus, the previous fact
can be written also as s ∈ Cn . Since a code is determined by
its parity checks, we extend this notation to arbitrary graphs
G, so CG is the intersection of all the local codewords of the
parity checks inside G.
We use the LDPC ensemble code to transmit x over a
binary memoryless symmetric channel. The output y = (yz,i )
of the channel is used to compute the 1 -log-likelihood ratios

We prove the following main lemma.
Lemma 1: For N, L, K, R, w ﬁxed, with K even, we have
fN,L,L ≥ fN,L,w ≥ fN,L,1 ,

(4)

and the average entropies (3) satisfy the reversed inequalities.
Let us discuss the consequences of this lemma. The ﬁrst
thing to note is that we deal with three types of ensembles:
• The connected ensemble, if the window size is L. In
this case, sites have no relevance, and the interaction
between two variables is the same, no matter the position
of their sites. Let fN and hN denote the average free
energy and entropy of an individual ensemble with N
variable nodes, and (1 − R)N check nodes (of degree
K) with edges connected independently uniformly at
random to the variable nodes. We have fN,L,L = fLN
and hN,L,L = hLN .
• The ring ensemble, if the window size is w, with 1 <
w < L.
• The disconnected ensemble, if the window size is 1. There
is no interaction between variables at different sites. By
construction, the numbers of check nodes at each site are
1
i.i.d. Bi (1 − R)N L, L . Therefore we expect that the
average free energy and entropy for this ensemble satisfy
fN,L,1 ≈ fN and hN,L,1 ≈ hN up to a correction term
O(N −1/2 ) coming from the ﬂuctuations in the number of
parity checks at each position. The size of the ﬂuctuations
is implied by the observation at the beginning of Section
IV.

These remarks and Lemma 1 show that fN L ≥ fN,L,w ≥
fN + O(N −1/2 ). An argument showing the existence of the
large block length limits then allows to deduce the following.

equality (7) is shown to hold for regular (l, r) degrees, then we

can conclude that MAP = area , in other words the Maxwell
conjecture holds. In fact one would presumably obtain a much
stronger result: namely that the BP-GEXIT curve is equal to
the MAP-GEXIT curve for all > MAP .

(5)

The same equality holds for the average entropies (3).
Note that since the right hand side does not depend on L we
trivially conclude that the extra limit L → +∞ of the left
hand side also exists.
As explained in the introduction, spatially coupled codes
involve open chain constructions. Here we consider the following construction, which is similar to the one in [2]. Think conceptually that sites z are indexed by all integers, and that there
are N variable nodes at each site. We have (1−R)N (L+w−1)
parity checks that we distribute independently uniformly at
random among positions z ∈ {−w + 1, . . . , L − 1}. The K
edges of each check at position z are connected independently
and uniformly at random to variable nodes in the range
{z, . . . , z + w − 1}. Finally erase all variable nodes (together
with their edges) that are at positions z < 0 and z ≥ L. Note
that the total number of variable nodes is N L. The deﬁnitions
of the average free energy and entropy are the same as in the
open
periodic case and these quantities are denoted by fN,L,w and
open
hN,L,w . Essentially the open and ring free energies/entropies
differ by a boundary term that is O(L−1 ).

The same estimate holds for the average entropies (3).
From Lemmas 2 and 3 we immediately deduce an important
corollary, whose signiﬁcance we brieﬂy discuss.

III. P ROOF OF THE M AIN L EMMA
Proof of Lemma 1: Two types of ensembles are involved
in each of the two inequalities that we have to prove. Let
the window sizes of these ensembles, which we call type A
and type B, be wA and wB (i.e., either wA = L, wB = w
or wA = w, wB = 1). Likewise, if a parity check is drawn
using window size wA , we say it is of type A, and if it is
drawn using window size wB , we say it is of type type B. We
will interpolate between the ensembles of types A and B, by
building a chain in the following way: an ensemble of type r
(0 ≤ r ≤ (1−R)N L) is one in which r check nodes are drawn
using window size wB , and (1 − R)N L − r are drawn using
window size A (the type r depends, of course, on what A and
B are, but we drop this reference in the interest of brevity).
We denote by EA , EB and Er the expectations with respect
to the ensembles of type A, B and r, respectively. The claim,
expressed as EA,h [− log ZG ] ≥ EB,h [− log ZG ], is implied
by monotonicity along the chain, a fact which remains to be
proved:
Er−1,h [− log ZG ] ≥ Er,h [− log ZG ] .

(8)

The generation of ensembles of type r − 1 and r can be
coupled in the following way. The generation is done in two
phases. In the ﬁrst phase, generate r − 1 check nodes of type
B and (1 − R)N L − r check nodes of type A, which will
compose a base ensemble. In the second phase, we add an
extra check node to the base ensemble. If we choose it of
type A, we obtain an ensemble of type r − 1, whereas by
choosing it of type B, we obtain an ensemble of type r.
Since the ensembles of type r − 1 and r only differ in the
last choice made in the second phase, we can ﬁx a particular
˜
graph G of the base ensemble. Then the claim follows if we
can prove that

(7)

Imagine that we have a family of BMS channels (say the
BEC( ), BSC( ) or the BAWGNC( )) indexed by the noise
parameter . Consider the inﬁnite block length entropies on
both sides of equality (7) as functions of . The singularities1
in (or phase transition thresholds) for the spatially coupled
open system and individual system are the same in the inﬁnite
length limit.
We expect that the same equality holds for more general
ensembles. This would allow to fully prove the Maxwell
construction conjecture [8]. For concreteness take a regular (l, r) individual ensemble. This has a MAP threshold:
(l,r)
the entropy vanishes for
∈ [0, MAP [ and is positive for
(l,r)
> MAP . Alternatively one may say that its derivative
(l,r)
(the MAP-GEXIT function) vanishes for ∈ [0, MAP [ and
(l,r)
jumps to a positive value at MAP . One can deﬁne an area
(l,r)
threshold area , such that the integral of the BP-GEXIT curve

(9)

Since the only randomness that is left from the ensemble
generation is in the second phase, i.e., in the choice of
one check node n (drawn using window size A and B,
respectively), we make it explicit in the following way:

1 Asymptotic conditional entropies/free energies are continuous and convex/concave functions of . Singularities are found in derivatives.

V. C ONCLUSION
It is conceptually interesting that one may prove the
Maxwell conjecture by going through the route of spatial
coupling. As explained in the introduction, the proof will be
complete once we extend the present results to (l, r)-regular
codes.
We brieﬂy mention a slightly different point of view on
the whole problem. The BP threshold of the spatially coupled
ensemble is an algorithmic lower bound to the MAP threshold
of the underlying ensemble (it so happens that this bound is
sharp). This suggests to use spatial coupling as a method to
obtain good, if not sharp, algorithmic lower bounds for phase
transition thresholds in other problems beyond coding theory.
We refer the reader to [16] for a more extensive discussion
of this point, and for a result analogous to Corollary 4 for
random constraint satisfaction problems.
Acknowlegment. This work was supported by the Swiss
National Science Foundation grant no 200020-140388.

We begin with the following observation: adding an extra
˜
clause n to a graph G in an ensemble can only change
the quantity Eens,h [− log ZG ] by at most a constant. This is
˜
because the change is in fact Eens Fw∗ ,G , whose absolute
˜
value is upper bounded using (17), together with the fact that
∞
1
sn s ≤ 1 and the convergence of the series r=1 2r(2r−1) .
The ﬂuctuation in the free energy per node caused by an extra
1
clause will then be O N L .
Proof of Lemma 2: We follow the lead of [11] and use
some of the arguments of Lemma 1, thus we only provide a
proof sketch (however see the remark at the end of the proof).
By inspecting the deﬁnition of the free energy, one easily sees
that it is bounded uniformly in the system size. Thus, by a
standard argument, the existence of the limit (for an individual
system) follows from superadditivity, i.e.,

R EFERENCES

√
.
fN1 +N2
N1 + N2
(27)
The rest of the proof will be concerned with showing (27).
We consider ensembles with just two sites (L = 2), but with
different amounts N1 and N2 of variables at each site (N =
N1 + N2 ). We will deal with the cases w = 1 (disconnected)
and w = 2 (connected). In the case w = 1 when we add a
check, we place it with probability p1 = N1 /(N1 + N2 ) on
the ﬁrst site and p2 = N2 /(N1 + N2 ) on the second. To avoid
disc
conn
confusion, we denote by fN1 ,N2 and fN1 ,N2 the free energies
per site in the two cases. Then by modifying slightly the proof
conn
disc
of Lemma 1, we obtain that fN1 ,N2 ≥ fN1 ,N2 .
conn
We now identify fN1 +N2 with fN1 ,N2 and we are left to
disc
prove that indeed fN1 ,N2 corresponds to the r.h.s. of (27).
Note that if the number of check nodes that are affected to
the two sides would be proportional to N1 and N2 , then there
would be no need for the O(·) term. However, the amounts
of check nodes on the two sides are in fact binomial random
√
variables, with standard deviation O( N1 + N2 ). For each
√
additional or missing check node (of which there are O( N )),
1
the ﬂuctuation is O( N ), and thus the superadditivity relation
is fulﬁlled.
Remark 5: Classical proofs of (27) for spin systems on
regular lattices do not work for random graphs. The idea of
interpolating between two systems goes back to Guerra and
has been applied to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass,
and constraint satisfaction problems [15], [11]; however it
usually leads to subadditivity of the free energy. In the present
situation, the proof hinges on channel symmetry - through the
use of the Nishimori identity - and leads to superadditivity.
Proof of Lemma 3: The result follows directly from the
observation made at the beginning of this section. The amount
of check nodes at the ends of the chain is typically O(wN ),
and their overall contribution cannot change the free energy
per node by more than O(w/L).
