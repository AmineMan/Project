Abstract—In this article we construct an inﬁnite family of
linear error correcting codes over Fq for any prime power q.
The code parameters are
[q 2t + q t−1 − q 2t−1 − q t , 2t + 1, q 2t + q 2t−2 + q t−1 − 2q 2t−1 − q t ]q ,

for any positive integer t. This family is a generalisation of the
optimal self-complementary binary codes with parameters

8d(n − d)
,
n − (n − 2d)2

where u = 2t−1 . The codes are obtained by considering a submatrix of a specially constructed generalised Hadamard matrix.
The optimality of the family is conﬁrmed by using a recently
derived generalisation of the Grey-Rankin bound when t > 1,
and the Griesmer bound when t = 1.

provided the RHS of the inequality is positive. The Hadamard
code meets this bound with equality. A result of McGuire
[10] states that a self-complementary code meeting this bound
must be either a Hadamard code or must arise from a quasisymmetric design with speciﬁed intersection numbers. We do
not discuss the details of the quasi-symmetric designs here,
but we are interested in the codes they give. In [5] and [8]
there are constructions of these designs, which yield codes
with parameters

I. I NTRODUCTION

(2u2 − u, 8u2 , u2 − u)2 ,

[2u2 − u, 2t + 1, u2 − u]2 ,

We use the usual notation (n, M, d)q to denote an error
correcting code in Fn of size M and minimum distance d. If
q
the code is a linear subspace of dimension k, then we denote
it as [n, k, d]q . As this work is a generalisation of a family of
binary codes, we begin by reviewing the binary case.

for u = 2m , m an integer, m > 1. These codes are believed
to exist for all even u. They have been shown to exist
whenever there exists a u times u Hadamard matrix (see [2]
and [3]). Also, there is a construction for u = 6 [4] but all
other cases where u is equivalent to 2 modulo 4 are open.
These constructions use the structure of Hadamard matrices
to obtain the quasi-symmetric designs and hence the codes.
When u = 2t−1 , t > 1 and the codes have minimum 2-rank,
they give the linear family of codes

Deﬁnition 1: A Hadamard matrix H is an n by n matrix
with entries in {1, −1} such that,
HH T = nI,

[2u2 − u, 2t + 1, u2 − u]2 .

where I denotes the n by n identity matrix.

This is the family of codes that we are going to generalise to
the q-ary Hamming space by using the structure of generalised
Hadamard matrices.

It can be easily demonstrated that for a Hadamard matrix to
exist n must be a multiple of 4. It is conjectured, with strong
evidence, that a Hadamard matrix exists for all n divisible by
4.
Deﬁnition 2: A binary error correcting code C is said to be
self-complementary if for all words x ∈ C we have x+1 ∈ C,
where 1 is the all-1 vector (1, . . . , 1).

II. P RELIMINARIES
Deﬁnition 3: Let G be a group of order g and let λ be a
positive integer. A generalised Hadamard matrix GH(g, λ)
over the group G is a λg × λg matrix such that the pairwise
difference of any two rows of the matrix contains every
element of G exactly λ times.

By changing the symbols in the rows of H from 1 and -1 to
0 and 1, then adding to this set of rows the complements of the
rows and puncturing this code in one coordinate (by deleting
any column) we obtain an optimal self-complementary code
with parameters (n − 1, 2n, n − 1)2 . This is known as a
2
Hadamard code. The Grey-Rankin bound, which is applicable

For more about generalised Hadamard matrices we refer the
reader to [6] .

t

Let ri = (0, αi , αi+1 , . . . , αi+q −2 ) denote a row of the matrix
H. We let r0 = 0 denote the ﬁrst row. Then observe that

The generalised Hadamard matrix is called normalised if
the ﬁrst row and the ﬁrst column consist of only the identity
element of G. In this work we consider G to be the additive
group in the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fqt for t ≥ 1, where q is the power of
a prime. The generalised Hadamard matrix is also considered
as a code where each row is a codeword of the code. For a
GH(g, λ), we get a code of length λg, size λg, and distance
λg − λ.
There has been more than one generalisation of the Grey
Rankin bound. In this article we are only using the most recent
one from Bassalygo et al. [1]. This generalised Grey-Rankin
bound is stated as follows.

III. C ONSTRUCTION OF GH(q k , q 2t−k )
In this section we show how to construct a speciﬁc Generalised Hadamard matrix with parameters GH(q k , q 2t−k ) from
a GH(q t , 1). The construction is achieved by considering the
GH(q t , 1) as a code and then performing code operations such
as extension and concatenation.
Let H denote the normalised generalised Hadamard matrix
GH(q t , 1) with entries

Lemma 3.1: The code CH is an optimal nonlinear equidistant code with parameters (q t + 1, q 2t , q t )qt .
Proof: The extended code clearly has length q t + 1 and
size q 2t . To determine the distances in the extended code we
ﬁrst determine the distances in the code CH . The distance
between elements ri + β1, rj + β 1 of cosets H + β1 and
H + β 1, β, β ∈ Fqt , respectively, in CH is given by

q t − 1, if β = β , i = j

d(ri + β1, rj + β 1) = q t − 1, if β = β , i = j

For an [n, k, d]q linear code, the Griesmer bound gives the
length n(k, d) of the shortest linear code with dimension k
and minimum distance d.

where αk = αi + αl αj .
The fact that H is a generalised Hadamard matrix follows
from its linearity. Consider the code CH obtained by taking H
along with all its cosets H + β1 and β ∈ Fqt . The code CH is
also linear and has parameters [q t , 2t, q t − 1]qt . In the article
that introduces the generalised Grey-Rankin bound [1] there
is a combinatorial construction of codes with these parameters
and they show that the parameters satisfy the bound with
equality.
Next we extend the code CH by appending an extra element to every vector of CH as described below. For each
i = 1, . . . , q t − 1, the row ri of H is extended by appending
the element αi and the ﬁrst row of H is extended by appending
the element 0. Similarly the row in the coset H + β1 which
is obtained from row ri of H, is extended by appending αi to
it, and the row in the coset H + β1 corresponding to r0 of H
is extended by appending 0 to it. Denote this extended code
+
+
by CH . The following lemma gives the parameters of CH .

If a code has the property that for all words x ∈ C we have
x + γ1 ∈ C for all γ ∈ Fq , then the condition that a code
can be partitioned into trivial maximal subcodes (n, q, n)q is
also satisﬁed. So this can be thought of as a generalisation of
the self-complementary property of binary codes. In particular,
any linear code that contains the all one vector will also have
this property. We also note, when q = 2 this bound reduces
to the binary Grey-Rankin bound.

Hence, the code is equidistant. The code CH is optimal because
it satisﬁes the Plotkin bound with equality. A code with
parameters (n, M, d)q satisﬁes the Plotkin bound if

where α is a primitive element of Fqt . This matrix, when
considered as a codematrix, is a linear code with parameters
[q t , t, q t − 1]qt . The linearity of H can be proved as follows.

Now we will construct a family of generalised Hadamard
matrices GH(q k , q 2t−k ), for k = 1, . . . , t from the matrix
+
H = GH(q t , 1) and from the code CH . This is obtained by

2

+
concatenating the code CH with a punctured matrix obtained
from H.
Consider a linear projection of each element (in the additive
group of Fqt ) of H on to the additive subgroup in Fqk for any
k ∈ {1, . . . , t}. This projection can be achieved by ﬁrst considering the ﬁeld elements as vectors, with respect to a ﬁxed
basis, and then mapping the last t−k coordinates to zero. This
gives a generalised Hadamard matrix H(k) = GH(q k , q t−k )
[6].
We construct a matrix H − (k) from H(k) by removing
its ﬁrst column. When considered as a code H − (k) has
parameters [q t − 1, t, q t − q t−k ]qk . We concatenate H − (k)
+
+
with CH by replacing every element αi in CH by the row ri
−
t
of H (k), i = 1, . . . , q −1, and by replacing the element 0 in
+
CH by the ﬁrst row of H − (k). Denote the concatenated code
+
by H − (k) ◦ CH . Finally, extend the concatenated codematrix
+
−
H (k) ◦ CH by prepending an all-zero column to obtain the
codematrix H 2 (k).

Consider the code C(s) obtained by augmenting the concatenated code by the all-one vector 1 of length s(q t − 1). Note
that the code C(s) can also be obtained by puncturing the
matrix H 2 (1) appropriately, and then augmenting it by the
s(q t −1)
all-one vector 1 ∈ Fq
. The lemma below establishes the
parameters of the code C(s).
Lemma 4.1: The code C(s) has parameters
[s(q t − 1), 2t + 1, (d − 1)s]q ,
where d = q t − q t−1 . The code C(s) has ﬁve distances (in
increasing order):
(d − 1)s, d(s − 1), sd + q t − s − d, sd, and s(q t − 1).
Proof: The distances in the code C(s) are derived from
the distances in the component codes H − (1) and CH . Any two
∗
rows of H − (1) have distance d = q t − q t−1 . Two rows of CH
∗
have distance either s or s − 1. Thus two rows of H − (1) ◦ CH
have distance either sd or (s − 1)d. Without loss of generality
∗
let r0 be a row from H − (1) ◦ CH and r1 be a row from the set
−
∗
of codewords {c + 1 : c ∈ H (1) ◦ CH }. If r1 = r0 + 1 then
t
the distance between them is s(q − 1). Otherwise, we can
write r1 = r + 1, where r = r0 . Then the distance between
the codewords is given as

s(q t − 1),
if r1 = r0 + 1,

d(r0 , r1 ) = s(d − 1),
if d(r0 , r ) = s,


sd + n − s − d, if d(r0 , r ) = s − 1,

Proposition 3.2: The matrix H 2 (k) is a generalised
Hadamard matrix GH(q k , q 2t−k ).
+
Proof: Since the distance between any two rows in CH is
t
q , the two rows are equal in exactly one position. Thus, the
+
number of zeroes in the difference of two rows of H − (k)◦CH
t t−k
t
is exactly q (q
−1)+q −1. The extended code contributes
one extra zero to this count.
For any nonzero element, the number of such non-zero
+
elements in the difference of two rows of H − (k) ◦ CH
is exactly q t (q t−k ) since H − (k) contains all the nonzero
elements equally often. This proves that the code H 2 (k) is
a generalised Hadamard matrix.

where the last case follows because the distance between the
vectors is (s − 1)(d − 1) + n − 1. This establishes the distances
in the concatenated code C(s). The minimum distance of the
code can be inferred from the inequality s(d − 1) ≤ (s − 1)d,
for s ≥ d.

IV. C ONSTRUCTION OF OPTIMAL LINEAR CODES
In this section we describe the construction of a family of
optimal linear codes with parameters

The optimal linear code is now obtained by reducing the
number of distances in the code to four distances. This is
effected by choosing s = d. It now has parameters

[d(q t − 1), 2t + 1, d(d − 1)]q ,

[q 2t +q t−1 −q 2t−1 −q t , 2t+1, q 2t +q 2t−2 +q t−1 −2q 2t−1 −q t ]q .

where d = q t − q t−1 . When t > 1 we will be using
the generalised Grey Rakin bound to demonstrate the codes
optimality, which means we are showing that these are the
best linear codes containing the all one vector.
This linear code is obtained from H 2 = H 2 (1). The
construction is performed by ﬁrst concatenating a punctured
code obtained from CH with the code H − (1). Then the
resulting concatenated code is augmented by the all-one vector.
Fix a positive integer s ≥ d. Puncture the code CH such that
the resulting code contains only the ﬁrst s coordinates (more
generally, one may puncture it on any set of coordinates such
that the resulting code has exactly s coordinates). Denote the
∗
punctured code by CH . It has parameters [s, 2t, s − 1]qt .
∗
Consider the concatenation of the code CH with the code
∗
H − (1). We denote the concatenated code by H − (1) ◦ CH .
−
∗
Since the codes H (1) and CH are Fq -linear, the concatenated
∗
code H − (1) ◦ CH is also a linear code over Fq (see [7]).

Denote this linear code by C = C(d). Below we prove the
optimality of the code by comparing it to the generalised GreyRankin bound for t > 1, and to the Griesmer bound for t = 1.
When t = 1 the code has parameters;
[q 2 − 2q + 1, 3, q 2 − 3q + 2]q .
Theorem 4.2: For a linear code containing the all one
vector, the code C = C(d) is optimal when t > 1. When
t = 1, C(d) is an optimal linear code.
Proof: Let n = q t and d = n − n/q. Let C be any linear
code with parameters [N, K, D]q where N = d(n − 1), D =
d(d − 1), and K is the dimension of the code. Let M be the
size of C.
We ﬁrst prove the result for t > 1. Substituting the values
of N, D from the parameters of C gives us the generalised

We have used the fact that d = n − n/q in arriving at the
above expression. Also note that n = q t and hence the term
multiplying qn2 = q 2t+1 is strictly less than q. To show this,
substitute n = q t and note that for t ≥ 2,
(q − 2) (q − 1)
< 1.

For the linear code C with dimension K = 2t+1, it is optimal
if no larger linear code with dimension 2t + 2 can be found.
The generalised Grey-Rankin bound thus proves the optimality
of C.
For t = 1, we use the Griesmer bound and show that C
satisﬁes the Griesmer bound with equality. Note that K =
2t + 1 = 3. To satisfy the Griesmer bound with equality we
need to show that
