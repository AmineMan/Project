MIMO capacity. For example, the gap of the turbo coded
MIMO system with 200 transmit/receive antennas from MIMO
capacity is more than 7 dB. In this paper, we aim to reduce the
remaining gap by considering non-binary low-density paritycheck (NBLDPC) codes [8].
In this study, we have investigated the application of
NBLDPC codes to large MIMO systems which utilize the lowcomplexity minimum mean square error (MMSE) detection
as MIMO detector. We present how the soft-output MMSE
detector can straightforwardly work with NBLDPC decoder.
We demonstrate that the NBLDPC coded system performs best
among other coded schemes at SNR which is near to the large
MIMO capacity. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
We ﬁrst introduce NBLDPC codes in Section II. In Section
III, the system model used for all simulations is described.
In Section IV, we explain the soft-output MMSE detector
for NBLDPC decoder. In Section V, we present the decoding
performance of NBLDPC coded large MIMO systems. This
paper is closed with conclusions.

Abstract—In this paper, we have investigated the application of
non-binary LDPC codes to spatial multiplexing MIMO systems
with a large number of low power antennas. We demonstrate that
such large MIMO systems incorporating with low-complexity
MMSE detector and non-binary LDPC codes can achieve low
probability of bit error at near MIMO capacity. The new
proposed non-binary LDPC coded system also performs better
than other coded large MIMO systems known in the present
literature. For instance, non-binary LDPC coded BPSK-MIMO
system with 600 transmit/receive antennas performs within 3.4
dB from the capacity while the best known turbo coded system
operates about 9.4 dB away from the capacity. Based on the
simulation results provided in this paper, the proposed nonbinary LDPC coded large MIMO system is capable of supporting
ultra high spectral efﬁciency at low bit error rate.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this paper, we focus our attention to the spatial multiplexing MIMO system that employs hundreds transmit/receive
antennas and refer to such a system as large MIMO system.
The prominent advantage of large MIMO system is the improving in capacity which is proportional to the minimum of
the number of transmit and receive antennas [1]. As pointed
out in the literature [2], [3], placing a large number of antennas
is more amenable because the transmitted RF energy can be
more sharply focused in space. Therefore, we believe that a
large MIMO system would be practical in the near future to
support the increasing demand for high data rates in wireless
communications.
Concatenating the MIMO system with channel codes is a
methodology to increase reliability and performance of the
MIMO system. There has been a tremendous effort to develop
the coded MIMO systems, which include code-design, the
invention of soft-output detectors, joint detection and decoding
techniques and so forth, with the ultimate goal to approach
MIMO capacity (see e.g. [4], [5], [6]). We note that almost
works have studied the coded MIMO system with less number of transmit/receive antennas (e.g. 2 to 8 transmit/receive
antennas). Therefore, lacking in the literature is a performance
study of coded large MIMO system.
To the best of our knowledge, only large MIMO systems
concatenated with turbo code have been studied in [2], [3],
[7]. Although the turbo coded large MIMO system mentioned
above is very attractive in term of computational complexity
but there still exists a signiﬁcant performance gap to the

II. NBLDPC C ODES
An NBLDPC code C over Galois ﬁeld GF(2m ) is deﬁned
by the null-space of a sparse P × N parity-check matrix
A = {aij } deﬁned over GF(2m ), for i = 1, . . . , P and
j = 1, . . . , N
C = {x ∈ GF(2m )N | AxT = 0 ∈ GF(2m )P },
where m > 1 and x = (x1 , . . . , xN ) is a codeword. The i-th
parity-check equation can be written as
ai1 x1 + ai2 x2 + · · · aiN xN = 0,
where ai1 , . . . , ai1 ∈ GF(2m ) are the entries of i-th row of A.
The parameter N is the codeword length in symbol. Assuming
that A is of full rank, the number of information symbols is
K = N − P and the code rate is R = K/N .
We note that a non-binary symbol which belongs to GF(2m )
can be represented by the binary sequence of m bits. For
each m, we ﬁx a GF(2m ) with a primitive element α and
its primitive polynomial π. Once a primitive element α of
GF(2m ) is ﬁxed, each non-binary symbol is given by an mbits representation [9, p. 110]. For example, with a primitive
element α ∈ GF(23 ) such that π(α) = α3 + α + 1 = 0,
each symbol is represented as 0 = (0, 0, 0), 1 = (1, 0, 0),

1

Binary source

α = (0, 1, 0), α2 = (0, 0, 1), α3 = (1, 1, 0), α4 = (0, 1, 1),
α5 = (1, 1, 1) and α6 = (1, 0, 1). Let L(x) be the binary
representation of x ∈ GF(2m ). For the above example, we
can write L(x = α3 ) = (1, 1, 0). Thus, each coded symbol
xi ∈ GF(2m ), ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , N } of a non-binary codeword
represents m bits. We also denote n = mN and k = mK as
the codeword length and information length in bit, respectively.
An NBLDPC code is (dv , dc )-regular if the parity-check
matrix of the code has constant column weight dv and row
weight dc . The parity-check matrix A can be represented by
a Tanner graph with variable and check nodes [10, p. 75].
The belief propagation (BP) algorithm for NBLDPC decoder
[8] exchanges the probability vector of length 2m between
variable nodes and check nodes of the Tanner graph at each
iteration round ℓ.
In this paper, only is the (dv = 2, dc )-regular NBLDPC
code deﬁned over GF(28 ) considered due to the following
reasons :
1) The process to optimize the parity-check matrix A is
not required since this code is empirically known as the best
performing code especially for short code length. Moreover,
the NBLDPC code with dv = 2 can be encoded in linear time
[11].
2) The high decoding complexity of NBLDPC decoder can
be compensated since the A is very sparse [12].
3) This code seems to offer the best performance for
MIMO system with optimal MAP detection [13]. We therefore
expect that this code will offer the excellent performance over
large MIMO systems. We also note that the performance of
NBLDPC codes for MIMO systems with suboptimal detector
has not been reported.
Thank to these advantages, the NBLDPC codes have recently received an upsurge of research interest from wireless
community including the application to MIMO channels [13],
[14], [15], [16].

is a number of coded symbols per each transmission. Let
s = [s1 , s2 , . . . , sNt ]T ∈ CNt be the transmit signal vector.
Each entry si , ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , Nt } taken from AM must satisfy
the component-wise energy constraint E[∥si ∥2 ] = Es /Nt
where Es is the total transmitted power and E[·] denotes the
expectation. With this energy constraint, a large number of
transmit antennas Nt imply low power consumption per each
transmit antenna.
Considering a baseband discrete time model for a ﬂat fading
MIMO channel, the received vector y = [y1 , y2 , . . . , yNr ]T ∈
CNr of the spatial multiplexing Nt × Nr MIMO system is
given by
y = Hs + n.
(1)
The matrix H = [H1 H2 . . . HNt ] ∈ CNr ×Nt denotes the
channel fading matrix whose entry hkj is assumed to be
complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and unit
variance E[∥hkj ∥2 ] = 1. The vector n = [n1 , n2 , . . . , nNr ]T ∈
CNr is a noise vector whose entry is a complex white Gaussian
2
noise with zero mean and variance σn per real component.
The MIMO detector performs detection and produces the
prior probabilities (soft-output) for NBLDPC decoder. After
all N variable nodes are initialized, the NBLDPC decoder
performs decoding process and provides the estimated nonbinary symbols (hard output). These estimated symbols are
ﬁnally demapped to a sequence of estimated information bits.
In this paper, the channel matrix H is assumed to be known at
the receiver and we only focus on the square channel matrix,
i.e. Nt = Nr .
Since each entry of H has unit variance, the average signal
energy per receive antenna is Es . We follow the convention
2
that N0 /2 = σn to deﬁne the signal to noise ratio. In this
setting, the average signal to noise ratio (SNR) per receive
antenna, denoted by γ, is given by [4]

III. S YSTEM M ODEL
We adopt the conventional notation to denote the MIMO
system with Nt transmit antennas and Nr receive antennas as
Nt × Nr MIMO system. Let AM be the complex modulation
constellation of size M = 2p where p represents bit(s)
per modulated symbol. In this study, each antenna uses the
same modulation scheme and the mapping is a Gray-labelled
constellation. Figure 1 shows the spatial multiplexing MIMO
system concatenated with an NBLDPC code of rate R deﬁned
over GF(28 ).
At the transmitter side, a bit to symbol mapper maps a group
of 8 information bits to a non-binary symbol in GF(28 ). The
stream of K non-binary symbols is encoded into a codeword
of length N symbols through an NBLDPC encoder. Assuming
that the dimension of code and modulation is matched, i.e.,
m can be divided by p, each coded symbol in GF(28 ) is
then mapped to a group of q = 8/p modulated symbols by a
constellation mapper. At each time instant (each channel use),
the transmitter simultaneously sends Nt = Kt q modulated
symbols in parallel through Nt transmit antennas where Kt

The spectral efﬁciency (transmitted information rate) of

where the superscript H denotes the Hermitian transpose

be evaluated via the Monte-Carlo simulation. Both of spectral
efﬁciency and capacity are measured in bits/sec/Hz (bps/Hz).

to send the v-th coded symbol (any coded symbol is mapped
to q modulated symbols). The generation of soft-output from

IV. S OFT-O UTPUT MMSE D ETECTOR
FOR NBLDPC D ECODER
One of the major problems that prohibits large MIMO systems from practical implementation is the high computational
complexity of MIMO detector. Even with modern and highspeed circuits, the optimal MAP detector is still infeasible.
Therefore, many works have recently focused on inventing
the low-complexity detectors to enable the use of large scale
multiple antennas [17].
In this paper, we consider the MMSE detector which is a
famous class of linear detection since it has low computational
complexity. Based on the complexity analysis provided in
[2], the MMSE detector has an average per-bit complexity of
O(Nt Nr ) which is lower than the well-known ZF-SIC (zeroforcing with successive interference cancellation) detector
whose average per-bit complexity is O(Nt2 Nr ). Several nearoptimal MIMO detection algorithms such as sphere detection
or lattice reduction-aided detection also exhibit high computational complexity which is much greater than O(Nt Nr ) [2].
Let us introduce the MMSE detector and the soft-output
generation for NBLDPC decoder. Following [18], a detection
estimate sk of the transmitted symbol on k-th antenna by
ˆ
multiplying yk with the MMSE weight matrix Wk

where sk+i is the estimation on the (k + i)-th receive anˆ
tenna, sk+i ∈ AM and the eight bits ordered sequence of
(sk , sk+1 , · · · , sk+q−1 ) must be equal to the binary representation L(x). According to (8), 28 (q − 1) real multiplications
(0)
for each coded symbols are needed to calculate pv (x) for
8
all x ∈ GF(2 ). We note that the computational complexity
of generating soft-output for NBLDPC decoder is rather low
when comparing to the computation of MMSE matrix. We then
use the soft output calculated from (8) to initialize the belief
propagation (BP) algorithm employing as NBLDPC decoder
[8]. BP algorithm exchanges the probability vector of length
2m between variable nodes and check nodes of the Tanner
graph at each iteration round ℓ.
V. S IMULATION R ESULTS
In this section, the performance of NBLDPC coded 600 ×
600 MIMO system with MMSE detector (NBLDPC coded
system for simplicity) is presented. Nt = Nr = 600 are
chosen in order to compare with the coded performances
presented in [2]. The maximum iteration of NBLDPC decoder
ℓmax is set to 100 for all simulation results.
Figure 2 presents the simulation results for 600×600 MIMO
system. This ﬁgure shows that R = 1/3 and R = 1/2
NBLDPC coded systems operate within 3.4 and 3.6 dB,
respectively, from the corresponding MIMO capacities. The
turbo coded system with MMSE-LAS detector in [2] is used
as the competitor. The performance of this turbo coded system
over 600 × 600 MIMO system is away from the capacity
by about 9.4 dB. It is obviously seen that R = 1/3 turbo
coded system underperforms R = 1/3 NBLDPC coded system
by more than 6 dB. More interestingly, R = 1/2 NBLDPC
coded system absolutely outperforms R = 1/3 turbo coded
system by about 3.4 dB. Therefore, the NBLDPC coded
system outperforms the turbo coded system both in term of
performance and spectral efﬁciency.
We also investigate the BER performance of coded large
MIMO system with higher-order modulation. The coded performance of 600 × 600 MIMO system with 16-QAM is shown
in Fig. 3 and 4. From both ﬁgures, the following observations
can be listed as follows :
• R = 1/3 and R = 1/2 NBLDPC coded systems with n =
2400 bits operate within 6 dB and 8 dB, respectively, from
MIMO capacity.
• R = 1/3 and R = 1/2 turbo coded systems [2] operate very
far (more than 15 dB) from MIMO capacity. The main factor

This MMSE weight matrix Wk is chosen so as to minimize

that contributes to this large gap from capacity is the detector
considered in [2] is not soft-output based detector. So, it is not
surprising that the NBLDPC coded systems indeed beat turbo
coded systems
• By increasing the length of code from n = 2400 bits to
n = 28800 bits, the coding gain about 0.7 dB can be obtained
from R = 1/3 NBLDPC coded system.
• For moderate codeword lengths (n = 2400 bits) and the
same MMSE detector, R = 1/3 NBLDPC coded systems
outperform both the optimized and regular binary LDPC
(BLDPC) codes (see Fig. 4). The coding gains obtained over
optimized and regular binary LDPC codes are about 0.8 and
2 dB respectively. The regular binary LDPC code has column
weight 4 and row weight 6 whereas the optimized binary
LDPC code is taken from Table. III in [21] The maximum
degree of variable node of selected optimized binary LDPC
code is 16. This optimized code can asymptotically perform
within 0.19 dB from the capacity of single input single output
Rayleigh fading channel.
• Another advantage of using NBLDPC code which can be
seen from Fig. 4 is the excellent frame error rate (FER).
Comparing with optimized BLDPC code, sharp decrease in the
FER curve is obtained. Although the BER curve of optimized
BLDPC code is good but its corresponding FER curve is quite
poor.
For binary LDPC coded MIMO system with MMSE detector, We compute the input of binary LDPC decoder according to the expression given in [18]. It is known that the
performance of BLDPC coded system can be enhanced by
adding the number of iterations between decoder and detector
but, for large MIMO systems, this will greatly increase the
computational complexity. Thus, the simulation for BLDPC
coded system with joint detection and decoding is not carried
out.

1/3 BLDPC codes on 600 × 600 MIMO systems with 16-QAM modulation
at n = 2400 bits. The solid curves represent the BER performance while the
dashed curves are the corresponding FER performance.

Although the MMSE detector has very poor detecting
performance for MIMO system with Nt = Nr but in this
section we have demonstrated that the application of this
detector to NBLDPC coded system is somewhat excellent.
Therefore, one may be surprised why MMSE detector yields
such good coded performance. Let us take a closer look at the
uncoded results shown in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the
uncoded performance of MMSE detector for 600 × 600 and
16 × 16 MIMO systems are very similar to those of nearoptimal MIMO detectors for low SNR region. Noticeably,

4

those regions are the operating regions for coded systems.
By trial and error, we suspect that the key component to
achieve good performance from NBLDPC coded system is not
a detection part but a soft-output generation. We note that other
methodologies for generating soft-output from linear MIMO
detection such as the one described in [22, p. 358] leads to
seriously degraded performance (not shown here).

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, the NBLDPC coded large MIMO systems
are studied. The low-complexity MMSE detector is employed
to provide the soft-input for NBLDPC decoder. We have
demonstrated that the proposed NBLDPC coded system can
signiﬁcantly decrease the remaining gap from MIMO capacity
which is previously obtained from the best known turbo coded
systems. By using moderate length NBLDPC codes (a few
thousand bits), the proposed coded system can perform near
MIMO capacity which is closest than ever. We therefore
conclude that the NBLDPC coded large MIMO system can
be one of the best choices to achieve both the excellent BER
performance and the ultra high spectral efﬁciency.
