Abstract—In this paper, an improved multiple input multiple output Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (MIMO-THP) is introduced, where the transmit power loss is reduced based on
optimizing the interference to be canceled. The concept behind
the proposed technique builds on the fact that both the desired
and interfering signals originate from the base station (BS) of
the downlink system itself. Based on this observation, the proposed method inﬂuences the resulting interference, to reduce the
transmission power required to cancel it, without altering the
information content of the downlink message. The aim is to bring
the interference closer to the replicas of the desired symbols
for all users in the THP modulo-extended constellation. In this
way, the power required to pre-subtract interference is decreased.
Theoretical and simulation results both conﬁrm that, by optimizing
the interference to be canceled, the proposed technique offers a
considerable transmit power reduction compared to conventional
THP while securing an equal error rate performance.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The need to produce power- and cost-efﬁcient mobile devices
has recently stimulated interest towards precoding schemes for
the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) downlink transmission. Simple forms of precoding schemes already appear in communication standards such as the 3GPP Long Term Evolution
(LTE) [1] and are expected to dominate future implementations
of telecommunications networks. Capacity achieving non-linear
dirty paper coding (DPC) techniques [2] have been proposed
for pre-subtracting interference prior to transmission. The DPC
methods developed so far are in general complex as they require
sophisticated sphere-search algorithms [3] to be employed at
the transmitter and assume codewords with inﬁnite length for
the encoding of the data. On the other hand, linear precoding
schemes [4]-[6] offer the least complexity, but their performance
is far from achieving the optimum maximum likelihood bound.
Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) is presented for the
MIMO downlink in [7] as a low complexity, sub-optimum
alternative to DPC. This scheme, inspired by the work in [8]
proposed for the inter-symbol interference channel, applies a
modulo pre-subtraction of the known interference. However, the
THP scheme suffers three forms of performance losses: power
loss, modulo loss and shaping loss.
The use of the modulo operation at the transmitter and
receiver results in an increased transmit power compared to
the case when no precoding is used. This is quantiﬁed by the
power loss and happens because the transmitted symbols are
distributed in the Voronoi region [7] of the nominal constellation
points which consists of an extension of the symbol constellation area. To alleviate this problem, in [9] it is proposed to
adaptively tilt the constellation used, in such a way that the

1

transmit power is minimized on an instantaneous basis. This
causes a reduction in the transmission efﬁciency due to the
need to allocate channel resources for the transmission of side
information, to inform the receiver which angle was used at the
transmitter. This paper proposes a dynamic THP scheme which
adaptively inﬂuences the interference to reduce its quantized
distance to the desired symbol and the resulting power loss.
In particular, the interference experienced between the MIMO
sub-streams is generated by the symbols transmitted by the BS
itself, which means that the transmitter can inﬂuence and alter
the interference between the transmitted symbols. Furthermore,
as a result of the QR factorization used in THP one of the users
experiences no interference, while causing interference to all
remaining users.
Based on this observation, the proposed scheme takes a
further step in precoding along the interference. The amplitude
and phase of the transmitted symbol of the interference-free
user is optimized so that the resulting interference experienced
by the rest of the users is moved closer to one of the replicas
of the desired constellation points, in the modulo-extended
symbol constellation. This is done under the constraint that a
threshold performance for this user is guaranteed. By doing
so, the precoding power loss is reduced, without affecting
the average error rate performance. Initial results involving
amplitude-only optimization of the transmitted symbol of the
interference-free user were shown in [10]. It should be made
clear that the proposed scheme does not consist of a power
allocation THP scheme. The amplitude and phase of the ﬁrst
user here are optimized to align interference to the desired
symbols, as opposed to power allocation THP schemes (e.g.
[11]) where power is allocated to the users according to their
channel conditions and required transmission rates. In fact,
power allocation can be used as an add-on to the proposed
scheme by adjusting the bases of the modulo operations. For
simplicity and to restrict the focus of the paper, power allocation
is not considered here and we consider the zero forcing THP
design.
II. C HANNEL M ODEL AND C ONVENTIONAL P RECODING
A. MIMO Downlink Channel Model
We consider a downlink system comprised of a single BS
equipped with N transmit antennas and M ≤ N users with a
single receive antenna each. The received signals of all antennas
can be represented by the vector
r=H·x+w

(1)

Here r ∈ CM ×1 and H ∈ CM ×N ∼ CN (0, M1N IM ⊗ IN )
contains the frequency ﬂat fading channel coefﬁcients with the

(m, n)-th element hm,n being the complex-Gaussian channel tap
between the n-th transmit and the m-th receive antenna. Also,
x ∈ CN ×1 is the vector with the symbols transmitted by the N
transmit antennas and w ∈ CM ×1 ∼ CN (0, σ 2 IM ) is the vector
of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) components at the
M receive antennas. For the purposes of the analysis below, full
knowledge of channel state information (CSI) is assumed at the
BS transmitter, which is a common assumption for precoding
schemes.
B. Zero Forcing Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP)
For THP the channel matrix is ﬁrst lower-triangularized to
attain the following lower triangular matrix with ones on its
diagonal
B=G·H·F

(2)

where F is a unitary precoding matrix obtained by the QL
factorization (an equivalent of QR factorization) of the channel
matrix HH = F · L where LH = H · F is lower triangular and
G = diag({L}−1 ) represents the scaling operation of the signal
i,i
at the receiver. In this way the MIMO channel is transformed
into the formulation

III. C OMPLEX D OMAIN I NTERFERENCE O PTIMIZED THP
(CIO-THP)
Fig. 1 graphically illustrates the concept of CIO-THP processing by comparison to THP, for the example of 4QAM, for
a two-user downlink (considered for simplicity). The dashed
lines correspond to THP and the solid lines to the proposed
CIO-THP. For THP, it is assumed that x1 = u1 (denoted by
the dashed green arrow) is the non-optimized interference-free
symbol, while x2 experiences interference I2 = b2,1 x1 (dashed
red arrow) from symbol x1 . The aim of the transmit processing
is to code along I2 and transmit its quantized distance to the
desired symbol u2 . The transmit modulo operation then selects
the symbol replica that matches the instantaneous data symbol
and is closest to the direction of interference, and transmits
its distance to I2 (dashed black arrow). In the abovementioned
THP processing and in (3) it can be seen that user 1, being an
interference-free user, does not need to apply any interference
subtraction. Therefore, the modulo operation to limit the transmitted power can be avoided for user 1. This allows a margin
for inﬂuencing the symbol x1 without sacriﬁcing the reliability
of its detection.
To illustrate the concept behind the proposed algorithm, the
solid lines in ﬁg. 1 show the operation of CIO-THP. Now the
˜
amplitude and phase of x1 are changed in x1 (solid green
arrow). x1 is altered in such a way that the resulting interference
˜
˜
˜
I2 = b2,1 x1 (solid red arrow) to u2 is brought closer to a replica
u2 of the constellation point of u2 . It can be seen that in this
ˆ
case the system beneﬁts in two ways: a) since the amplitude
of x1 is increased, user 1 experiences better performance and
˜
b) the resulting interference (which is also amplitude-phase
optimized) is closer to the replica u2 of the information symbol
ˆ
u2 and hence lower transmitted power needs to be spent for
the cancellation of the interference in x2 (solid black arrow).
˜
Note that the total transmit power Ptot = |x1 |2 + |x2 |2 is the
same for both techniques in ﬁg. 1. It can therefore be observed
that for CIO-THP, from the total amount of power transmitted
a larger percentage is invested in the information of the symbol

x1 than in the cancellation of interference in x2 , compared to
THP. To guarantee a performance threshold for the interferencefree user after the optimization of its interference to the second
user, x1 can fall within the region of the constellation where
˜
the distances to the decision thresholds (real-imaginary axes)
are above a speciﬁed threshold. This is denoted by the green
area around x1 in ﬁg. 1. Using this constraint, the modiﬁcation
of the phase and amplitude of x1 (factor α below) need not be
signaled to the receiver.

To exploit the above observations, it is proposed that the real
and imaginary parts of the symbol of the interference-free user
are scaled by the factors αr , αi respectively such that the output
power distribution is optimized. The transmitted symbol of user
k is then given as

the most practical modulation schemes relevant to existing
communication standards. In this table g1,1 is the ﬁrst diagonal
element of the diagonal matrix G and γ is a signal-to-noise
(SNR) threshold.
Note that, since α is such that the received symbol falls in
the green shaded area of ﬁg. 1 and the received SNR is strictly
increased, there is no need to equalize α at the receiver. Hence α
need not be fedforward to the receiver and the receive processing
follows the one for standard THP as shown in eq. (6).

In (20) {L}k,k = lk,k is the k-th diagonal element of the matrix
L. We shall calculate the probability of error for THP and CIOTHP based on the SNR of this expression and separately taking
into account the modulo loss imposed by the modulo operation
at the receiver.
A. THP
Using the results in [15] it can easily be seen that for the QR
decomposition of the scaled channel matrix H assumed here
2
with elements of zero mean and variance σh = M1N we have
1

i.i.d elements with lk,n ∼ CN (0, σlk,n = M N ) for n < k and
2
2
lk,k ∼ Xd with d = 2(M −k+1) , where lk,n is the (k, n)-th
MN
element of the lower triangular matrix L. Using the above, the
average received SNR for THP can be written as
Eb 2(M − k + 1)
·
(21)

M ·N
where Eb and N0 are the per bit and noise power respectively.
The probability of symbol error for a ﬂat fading channel for

where Q(x) = √1

the effect of the modulo operation at the receiver (modulo loss)
is to double the probability of error for 4QAM modulation for

The extension to higher order modulation such as 16-QAM is
straightforward using the following and the derivations of [14]
on the resulting modulo loss. From (6) it can be seen that, the

By substituting γ1 in (22) we can calculate P for CIO-THP

from (IV-A). In the following section the above expressions are
compared to numerical results, revealing a close match between
theory and simulation.
V. S IMULATION R ESULTS
This section presents numerical results based on Monte Carlo
simulations of the proposed CIO-THP and conventional THP
for the frequency ﬂat Rayleigh fading statistically uncorrelated
MIMO channel whose impulse response is assumed perfectly
known at the transmitter. A system employing 4QAM modulation is explored for the case with N = M while it is clear that
the beneﬁts of the proposed technique extend to systems with
more antennas and higher order modulation.
In ﬁg. 2 the power loss for THP and CIO-THP with γ =
Eb /N0 , i.e. when the SNR threshold for the interference-free
user is equal to the average transmit SNR, is compared for
increasing numbers of antennas N =M . It can be observed that
there is actually a power gain for systems with up to N =4
antennas. Clearly, however, the power loss reduction for CIOTHP continues for higher numbers of antennas.
Fig. 3 shows the power loss averaged over the users with
increasing average transmit SNR=Eb /N0 (in dB) for a 4 × 4
MIMO system for conventional THP compared to for CIO-THP
for γ=15 / 20 / 25 dB and when γ = Eb /N0 . It can be seen
that a degree of reduction of the power loss appears for low
transmit SNR values which signiﬁcantly ampliﬁes for higher
transmit SNR values where greater margins are available for

coding along interference, where the transmitter controls the
resulting interference to make its cancellation more efﬁcient.
It was shown that by judiciously adjusting the amplitude and
phase of the interference-free user, the proposed scheme needs
to invest less transmission power in order to cancel interference
and the power loss for THP is signiﬁcantly reduced.

the optimization of the interference caused by user 1. For the
case when γ = Eb /N0 a constant gain in transmit power is
observed which amounts to 21.95% of the power transmitted
with THP.
Next we quantify the beneﬁts of CIO-THP in the error rate
performance when the saved transmission power is reinvested
to attain a greater received SNR. In ﬁg. 4 the symbol error rate
(SER) is shown for increasing SNR for a 2 × 2 MIMO for both
THP and CIO-THP with γ = Eb /N0 and γ = 20dB. For this
comparison the power saved by CIO-THP is used to scale up
the transmitted symbols and hence both techniques have equal
transmitted power. The analytically calculated average performance of section IV for both techniques is also included and it
is evident that it closely matches the simulated performance. It
can be seen that an SNR gain of up to 5dB for CIO-THP can
be achieved in this small scale 2 × 2 MIMO system.
