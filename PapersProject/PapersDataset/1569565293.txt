discrete memoryless ICs, i.e.,

Abstract— There exist vector Gaussian interference channels
that may not satisfy the strong interference condition but for
which the capacity can still be achieved by jointly decoding
the signal and the interference. This kind of interference is
called generally strong interference. Sufﬁcient conditions for a
vector Gaussian interference channel to have generally strong
interference are derived. The sum-rate capacity and the boundary
points of the capacity region are also determined.
Furthermore, new sufﬁcient conditions for a vector Gaussian
interference channel to achieve the sum-rate capacity by treating
interference as noise are derived, which generalize all the existing
results. Some boundary points on the capacity region of a
vector Z interference channel under noisy interference are also
determined to be achieved by treating interference as noise.

I (X1 ; Y1 |X2 ) ≤ I (X1 ; Y2 |X2 )

I (X2 ; Y2 |X1 ) ≤ I (X2 ; Y1 |X1 )
0 ≤ R1 ≤ I (X1 ; Y1 |X2 Q)

where Q is a time sharing random variable.
Although the discrete memoryless ICs, scalar ICs and
MIMO ICs all have the same strong interference condition,
the same capacity achieving coding scheme and the same expression for the capacity region, an observation about the very
strong interference condition leads us to reconsider whether
the deﬁnition of strong interference is appropriate. A scalar
IC is said to have very strong interference [6] if

zero mean and identity covariance matrix; and Hi and Fi ,
i = 1, 2, are the channel matrices which are assumed to be
known at both the transmitters and receivers. Transmitter i
has ti antennas and receiver i has ri antennas. Without loss
of generality, we assume Hi = 0 and Pi > 0.
The capacity region of a MIMO IC with strong interference

Gaussian IC with very strong interference is

For the scalar Gaussian IC, the very strong interference condition (6) is a special case of the strong interference condition
(2) Fi2 ≥ Hi2 . However, for the MIMO IC the very strong
interference condition is generally not a special case of strong
interference. As an example, we consider a MIMO IC with

B means that A, B and A − B
are all symmetric positive semi-deﬁnite. This result includes
the single-input-multiple-input (SIMO) IC [2], and the scalar
IC with strong interference [3], [4] both as special cases. It
can be shown that the strong interference condition (2) is

where R1 (r) is the maximum in the following optimization
problem:

The above inconsistencies motivate us to reconsider more
appropriate strong interference conditions than those in [1] and
[3]–[5]. Noting that the key is whether or not joint decoding
of X1 and X2 achieves the capacity, not whether inequalities
(3) and (4) are satisﬁed by all input distributions, we deﬁne a
new strong interference condition as follows:
Deﬁnition 1: An IC is said to have generally strong interference, if its capacity region is given by (5a)-(5c); or
equivalently, if the capacity region is achieved by jointly
decoding X1 and X2 at each receiver.
We focus on only the input distribution and the coding
scheme that achieve the boundary of the capacity region,
instead of any possible input distributions. Clearly, generally
strong interference includes both strong interference and very
strong interference as special cases. For the IC with generally
strong interference, there may exist input distributions that are
not capacity achieving, such that the receiver cannot correctly
decode the interference (e.g., the MIMO IC implementing
zero-forcing beamforming).
Besides generally strong interference, we also consider
noisy interference which is deﬁned as the condition such that
treating interference as noise achieves the capacity. The MIMO
IC with noisy interference was studied in [1], [7] and [8].
Speciﬁcally, [1] and [8] obtained different sufﬁcient conditions
for noisy interference. When reducing to diagonal channel
matrices, [1] and [8] are both special cases of [7]. In this paper,
we derive a new set of conditions which include all the above
results as special cases and extends upon them. Moreover, we
obtain some boundary points of the capacity region of a MIMO
Z interference channel (ZIC) which are achieved by treating
interference as noise.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present
results for generally strong interference and noisy interference
in Sections II and III, respectively. Numerical examples are
given in Section IV. We conclude in Section V.

Proof: The rate pair {R1 (r), r} is achievable since it satisﬁes

of problem (13) given R2 = r. The Lagrangian conditions are
from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theorem.

Proof: We only outline the proof due to the space limitations.
Suppose that x 2 and f 1x 1 + n 1 are provided to receiver 1
where n 1 ∼ N (0, I) is correlated with z 1 as E z 1n T =

with average input covariance matrices S1 and S2 , we obtain
gs1 (S1 , S2 ). Similarly, we obtain gs2 (S1 , S2 ).

i
i
∗
(R1 (r) , r) is on the boundary of the capacity region, and
is achieved by Gaussian inputs x i ∼ N (0, S∗ ) and by jointly
i
decoding x 1 and x 2 .
Proposition 2: For the MISO ZIC in the form of (21) with
a1 = 0, a2 = a and θ2 = θ, if a cos2 θ ≥ 1 + P1 , then the
capacity region is Ri ≤ 1 log(1+Pi ), i = 1, 2, and is achieved
2
by (22) with φ∗ = θ.
If a cos2 θ ≤ 1 + P1 , then for any φ∗ that satisﬁes

where Oi is deﬁned in (19), then the rate pair
∗
{R1 = R1 (r), R2 = r} is on the boundary of the
capacity region, and is achieved by the input distributions
x i ∼ N (0, S∗ ), i = 1, 2, and jointly decoding the signal and
i
the interference.
Proof: We give an outline of the proof. From the outer bound
in (15), we ﬁrst formulate an optimization problem similar to
(13) to ﬁnd the boundary of the outer bound. Next we show
that the new optimization problem is also a convex problem
and write the KKT conditions similar to those in Lemma 2
¯
with Lagrangian multipliers αi , βi , νi and Ki . It can be shown
¯ ¯ ¯
¯
that with the same S∗ , if αi = αi , βi = βi , νi = νi and
¯
¯
i
¯
Ki = Ki −βj Oi , the KKT conditions for the new optimization
problem are satisﬁed and the maximum is the same as the
maximum in problem (13) under condition (20). Therefore,
∗
{R1 (r), r} is on the boundary of the capacity region.
Remark 1: The very strong interference condition (7) implies βj = 0. In this case the generally strong interference
condition is satisﬁed and we do not need the existence of Ai .
The strong interference condition (2) implies Oi = 0. It is
obvious that strong interference may not include very strong
interference as a special case, but both are special cases of
generally strong interference.
Using Theorem 1, we obtain the capacity for multiple-inputsingle-output (MISO) and SIMO ICs with generally strong
interference. We note that any MISO or SIMO IC has the same
capacity region as that of a two-antenna MISO or SIMO IC
[8] with channel vectors being h i and f i , or h T and f T , where

IV. N UMERICAL EXAMPLES
Figs. 1 and 2 show the maximum or minimum values of a
for a MISO ZIC to have generally strong interference or noisy
interference. In both ﬁgures, we let f 1 = 0 and f 2 = [a, 0]T .
Fig. 3 is an achievable region of a MISO ZIC. By Proposition
6, the curve segment AB is on the boundary of the capacity
region and is achieved by treating interference as noise.

V. C ONCLUSION
We have determined the generally strong interference capacity region and the noisy-interference sum-rate capacity for
MIMO ICs, and have determined some boundary points of the
capacity region of MISO ZICs under noisy interference.
