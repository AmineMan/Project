Here, ·, · denotes the scalar product on Rd and β ∗ (z, r)
is equal to supt∈R [tr−β(z, t)] for r ∈ R. In (2)/(3), the
minimization/maximization is called primal/dual problem, the
inﬁmum/supremum primal/dual value, and a minimizer/maximizer, if exists, is a primal/dual solution. Since β is strictly
convex, the primal solution, denoted by ga , is unique in the
sense that any two minimizers are equal µ-a.e.
Minimization problems as in (2) emerge across various
scientiﬁc disciplines, notably in inference. When g is an
unknown probability density, or any nonnegative function,
whose moment vector is determined by measurements and
a speciﬁc choice of β is justiﬁed, often the primal solution
as above is adopted as the ‘best guess’ of g. Among autonomous integrands, typical choices of β are t ln t or − ln t
or t2 giving Hβ (g) equal to the negative Shannon or Burg
entropy or the squared L2 -norm of g 0. Note also that the
maximum likelihood estimation in exponential families is a
special case of the dual problem (3), with β equal to t ln t.
When a ‘prior guess’ h for g is available, that would be
adopted before the measurement, it is common to use a nonautonomous integrand β depending on h for which Hβ (g)
represents a non-metric distance of g from h. Two cases
are prominent: γ-divergence Z h γ(g/h)dµ with γ ∈ Γ
[6], [1], [20] and Bregman distance [5], [13], [16], see (6).
Then the corresponding primal solution is often referred to
as a projection of h to Ga . In particular, the most familiar
I-projections correspond to the information (I-) divergence
that belongs to both families of distances. Note that while
the minimization of a γ-divergence can be reduced to that
of an integral functional with autonomous integrand, this is
in general not possible for Bregman distances whence the
nonautonomous integrands become unavoidable.
The primal problem is well understood when the following
primal constraint qualiﬁcation (PCQ) holds

Abstract—Integral functionals based on convex normal integrands are minimized subject to ﬁnitely many moment constraints. The integrands are assumed to be strictly convex but not
autonomous or differentiable. The effective domain of the value
function is described by a modiﬁcation of the concept of convex
core. The minimization is viewed as a primal problem and studied
together with a dual one in the framework of convex duality. Main
results assume a dual constraint qualiﬁcation but dispense with
the primal constraint qualiﬁcation. Minimizers and generalized
minimizers are explicitly described whenever the primal value
is ﬁnite. Existence of a generalized dual solution is established
whenever the dual value is ﬁnite. A generalized Pythagorean
identity is presented using Bregman distance and a correction
term. Results are applied to minimization of Bregman distances.

This work addresses minimization of integral functionals

Z

β(z, g(z)) µ(dz)

of real functions g on a σ-ﬁnite measure space (Z, Z, µ),
subject to the constraint that the moment vector Z ϕg dµ of
g is prescribed. Here, ϕ is a given Rd -valued Z-measurable
moment mapping.
In (1), β is any mapping Z×R → (−∞,+∞] such that β(·, t)
is Z-measurable for t ∈ R, and β(z, ·), z ∈ Z, is in the class Γ
of functions γ on R that are ﬁnite and strictly convex for t > 0,
equal to +∞ for t < 0, and satisfy γ(0) = limt↓0 γ(t). In
particular, β is a normal integrand whence z → β(z, g(z)) is
Z-measurable if g is [18, Chapter 14]. If neither the positive
nor the negative part of β(z, g(z)) is µ-integrable, the integral
in (1) is +∞ by convention. The integrand is autonomous if
β(z, ·) = γ, z ∈ Z, for some γ ∈ Γ .
Given a ∈ Rd , let Ga denote the class of those nonnegative
Z-measurable functions g whose moment vector exists and
equals a. By the assumptions on β, the minimization of Hβ
restricts to Ga . Following the key papers [3], [4], convex
duality has become a standard tool in the mathematically
oriented literature on the subject. The value function

Here, ri stands for the relative interior and dom for the effective domain. Theorem 1 below implies by standard convex
duality results [17] that under the PCQ the primal and dual
values coincide, a dual solution exists and explicitly speciﬁes
the primal solution when the latter exists. This covers for
example the classical maximization of Shannon differential
entropy over probability densities on R with given mean and
variance. Even under the PCQ the primal solution need not

The DCQ follows from dom(Kβ ) = ∅ when one component
of ϕ is 1. When Kβ is ﬁnite on an open set, the DCQ holds if
and only if

exist, as in Example 1. Note that while the PCQ often holds
for each a ∈ dom(Jβ ), perhaps with exception of the origin,
in many inference problems of practical interest this is not the
case. Hence, dispensing with the PCQ is desirable.
This work is a follow-up of the authors’ contribution [11]
at ISIT’08 motivated by their previous work [9] about Iprojections. As there, the PCQ is dispensed with, and in the
case when no primal/dual solutions exist, generalized solutions
in the sense of [19], [7] are studied. In [11], as in most
of the previous literature, it is assumed that the integrand
is autonomous, differentiable, and that the moment mapping
has one coordinate function identically equal to 1. In this
contribution, these assumptions are avoided, saving as many
conclusions as possible. For previous works not making these
assumptions see [14], [15], using advanced tools of functional
analysis. No such tools are used here, and neither is differential
geometry, see [2], which is powerful but requires strong
regularity assumptions.
Non-autonomous integrands do not entail conceptual difﬁculties since problems with measurability can be handled via
the machinery of normal integrands [18]. Non-differentiability
of β causes few results to fail. Absence of the special coordinate of ϕ is cured by adopting a dual constraint qualiﬁcation.
Some results here are new even in the framework of [11].
Space limitations do not admit a detailed presentation of
results, let alone their proofs. For these, and more references,
see the full paper [12] available on arXiv.

(5) µ z ∈ Z : ϕ(z) = 0 and limt↑+∞ β(z, t) = ±∞ = 0 .
If the DCQ holds then the maximization in the dual problem
can be restricted to Θβ without changing the dual value and
loosing a dual solution. Under the DCQ, if dual solutions ϑ
exist then each one induces the same function fϑ , called here
∗
the effective dual solution ga .
Proposition 1. For any a ∈ Rd , if fϑ ∈ Ga for some ϑ ∈ Θβ
∗
with Kβ (ϑ) ﬁnite then fϑ equals the effective dual solution ga ,
as well as the primal solution ga . Under the PCQ, the primal
solution ga exists if and only if Ga ∩ Fβ = ∅.
As a consequence, if Kβ is essentially smooth and (5) holds
then the primal solution ga exists for each a ∈ ri(dom(Jβ )).
The Bregman distance based on β is given by
(6)

∆β (z, g(z), h(z)) µ(dz)

γ(s) − γ(t) − γsgn(s−t) (t)[s − t] if γ+ (t) is ﬁnite,
and s · (+∞) otherwise. Here, γ ∈ Γ abbreviates β(z, ·) and
sgn(r) denotes + if r 0 and − if r < 0.
Bregman distances enter into the primal problem via the
following identity.
Proposition 2. Assuming the PCQ for a ∈ Rd and the DCQ,

∗
Theorem 1. If Jβ ≡ +∞ then Jβ = Kβ .

∗
Hβ (g) = Jβ (a) + Bβ (g, ga ) + Cβ (g),

g ∈ Ga .

In (7), Cβ is a sophisticated nonnegative correction functional
deﬁned explicitly in [12].
These results have been known in special settings with β
autonomous and (7) in a weaker form as the inequality obtained by neglecting the correction. If β is essentially smooth
then the correction vanishes anyhow and (7) is known as a
Pythagorean identity. For autonomous β that is differentiable
but not essentially smooth, the correction is determined in [11].

The hypothesis holds if Kβ is ﬁnite on an open set. The weaker
assumption that Kβ is proper (not identically +∞ and not
attaining −∞) is not sufﬁcient for Jβ ≡ +∞, see [12].
Theorem 2. If Kβ is ﬁnite in a neighborhood of ϑ ∈ Rd then
it is differentiable there, and Jβ ( Kβ (ϑ)) is ﬁnite.
A special role is played by the set Θβ of those ϑ ∈ dom(Kβ )
for which the function r → β ∗ (z, r) is ﬁnite in a neighborhood
of r = ϑ, ϕ(z) for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z. Equivalently,

If the primal value Jβ (a) is ﬁnite and all sequences gn in Ga
with Hβ (gn ) → Jβ (a) converge to a common limit function
ga then ga is called the generalized primal solution. Here, the
ˆ
ˆ
convergence is locally in measure, thus in measure on each set
A ∈ Z of ﬁnite µ-measure. Proposition 2 implies that, subject
to the PCQ and DCQ, the generalized primal solution ga exists
ˆ
∗
and equals the effective dual solution ga . Under the PCQ, the
generalized primal solution exists if and only if the DCQ holds.
This is a new result here, included in Theorem 6(iii).
The following example shows that the generalized primal
solution ga may be independent of a, and its moment vector
ˆ
need not exist. For other examples illustrating possible irregularities see [12].

Θβ = ϑ ∈ dom(Kβ ) : ϑ, ϕ(z) < β (z, +∞) µ-a.e.
where β (z, +∞) denotes the limit of right derivatives β+ (z, t)
when t ↑ +∞. Since β(z, ·) ∈ Γ implies that β ∗ (z, ·) is
differentiable on (−∞, β (z, +∞)), if ϑ ∈ Θβ then
z ∈Z,

deﬁnes a function fϑ on Z, up to a µ-negligible set. Similarly
to [11], the family Fβ
{fϑ : ϑ ∈ Θβ } plays the role of
generalized exponential families, provided that the following
dual constraint qualiﬁcation (DCQ) holds

a nonnegative integrand such that ∆β (z, s, t) for z ∈ Z and

The key for the close relationship of the primal and dual
problems is the following fact which, in this generality, does
not seem to directly follow from known results. It can be
proved via modiﬁcations of arguments in [18].

Example 1. Let µ be the Cauchy distribution on Z = R with
dµ = [π(1 + z 2 )]−1 dz, let β be the autonomous integrand
given by β(z, t) = t ln t, t > 0, and ϕ(z) = (1, z), z ∈ Z. For
a = (a1 , a2 ) with a1 0 and g ∈ Ga , if ν denotes the measure
with dν = g dµ then Hβ (g) equals the I-divergence D(ν||µ).
In the particular case a1 = 1, the primal problem is equivalent
to minimization of I-divergence from µ over the probability
measures ν with mean a2 . In dual problems, β ∗ (z, r) = er−1 ,
ϑ = (ϑ1 , ϑ2 ) and Kβ (ϑ1 , ϑ2 ) = R eϑ1 +ϑ2 z−1 µ(dz) is equal
to eϑ1 −1 if ϑ2 = 0, and +∞, otherwise. Hence, Θβ equals
dom(Kβ ) = R × {0}. For a in ri(dom(Jβ )) = (0, +∞) × R

cc(Q) consists of the integrals Rd x P (dx) where P is a
probability measure dominated by Q.
Lemma 1. The closure of cnc(Q) coincides with the smallest
closed convex cone with Q-negligible complement.
Let µϕ denote the ϕ-image of µ. In general, it is not σ-ﬁnite.
Lemma 2. If ν is a measure equivalent to µ and the image
νϕ is σ-ﬁnite on Rd \ {0} then cnϕ (µ) = cnc(νϕ ).
It follows that ϕ(z) ∈ cl(cnϕ (µ)) for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z.
Lemma 3. If F is a face of cnc(Q) then cnc(Qcl(F ) ) = F .

∗
Jβ (a) = Kβ (a) = maxϑ1 ∈R a1 ϑ1 − eϑ1 −1 = a1 ln a1 ,

Here, Qcl(F ) denotes the restriction of Q to cl(F ). Hence, the
ϕ-cone of the restriction of µ to ϕ−1 (cl(F )) equals F , and
µ(ϕ−1 (cl(F ))) > 0 except perhaps for F = {0}.

(1+ln a1 , 0) is the dual solution, and the effective dual solution
∗
∗
ga identically equals a1 . Since ϕga is not µ-integrable the
primal solution does not exist, by Proposition 1. Nevertheless,
∗
ga equals the generalized primal solution ga , by Proposition 2.
ˆ

Theorem 4. The conic core cnc(Q) consists of the integrals
xP (dx) for all ﬁnite (or σ-ﬁnite) measures P dominated
Rd
by Q such that x is P -integrable.

Additionally to (7), Bregman distances emerge also in the
dual problem (3), via the following existence result.

It follows that cnc(Q) equals the conic hull of cc(Q). The
faces of the two sets are not related to each other in general.
However, if Q is concentrated on a hyperplane that does not
contain the origin then there is a bijection between the families
of faces of cc(Q) and cnc(Q), up to the face {0} of the
latter: the faces of cnc(Q) are the conic hulls of the faces of
cc(Q). In particular, this takes place for Q = µϕ whenever
one coordinate of ϕ is 1, a fact that has been used in [11].

∗
Theorem 3. Assuming the DCQ, for every a ∈ Rd with Kβ (a)
ﬁnite there exists a unique Z-measurable function ha such that
∗
(8) Kβ (a) −

ϑ, a − Kβ (ϑ)

Bβ (ha , fϑ ) ,

ϑ ∈ Θβ .

As a consequence, if the dual problem has a solution ϑ ∈ Θβ
∗
then ha equals ga = fϑ . In general, (8) implies that whenever
ϑn is a maximizing sequence for ϑ, a − Kβ (ϑ), the Bregman
distances Bβ (ha , fϑn ) tend to zero, and thus fϑn converges
to ha locally in measure. The function ha in (8) is regarded
as generalized dual solution for a, extending the concept of
generalized maximum likelihood estimate introduced in [9] and
explicitly constructed in [10]. Our current proof of Theorem 3
is non-constructive, except for the case of equal primal and
dual values, when ha is equal to the generalized primal
solution ga .

Lemma 4. The moment vector Z ϕg dµ of a function g 0
with the ϕg integrable belongs to a face F of cnϕ (µ) if and
only if g(z) = 0 for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z with ϕ(z) ∈ cl(F ).
/
Let Fβ denote the family of faces F of cnϕ (µ) such that
the positive part of the integral {ϕ∈cl(F )} β(·, 0) dµ is ﬁnite.
/
The improper face cnϕ (µ) belongs to Fβ , and if F ⊆ G are
faces of cnϕ (µ) and F belongs to Fβ then so does also G.
Theorem 5. dom(Jβ ) =

III. T HE EFFECTIVE DOMAIN OF THE VALUE FUNCTION

F ∈Fβ

ri(F ) whenever Jβ ≡ +∞.

This shows that dom(Jβ ) is closed to positive multiples.
Another consequence is that Z β(·, 0) dµ < +∞ is a
sufﬁcient condition for dom(Jβ ) = cnϕ (µ). This condition is
also necessary when {0} is a face of cnϕ (µ) and ϕ = 0, µ-a.e.,
in particular, when one coordinate of ϕ identically equals 1.

The set of the moment vectors Z ϕg dµ of all nonnegative
functions g with ϕg integrable is a convex cone, referred to as
the ϕ-cone cnϕ (µ) of µ. It contains the effective domain of Jβ .
In this section, the domain is described via faces of cnϕ (µ).
Recall that a subset C of Rd is a cone if 0 ∈ C, and tx ∈ C
whenever t > 0 and x ∈ C. A face of a convex set C is a
nonempty convex subset F of C such that every closed line
segment in C with a relative interior point in F is contained
in F . The face is proper if F = C. A face of a convex cone
is a convex cone.
The ϕ-cones will be studied via a new notion deﬁned next,
for Borel measures Q on Rd that are σ-ﬁnite on Rd \ {0}.

Example 2. Let Z = R × {0, 1} and µ = µ1 × µ2 where µ1 is
a ﬁnite measure on R equivalent to the Lebesgue measure and
µ2 is the counting measure. Let the moment mapping be given
by ϕ(z) = (1, z1 , z2 ), z = (z1 , z2 ) ∈ Z. Then the ϕ-cone of µ
equals the sum of the sets
F = {(r, s, 0) : r > 0 , s ∈ R} ∪ {0}
G = {(r, s, r) : r > 0 , s ∈ R} ∪ {0} .
Its proper faces are F , G and {0}. Let the integrand β be given
by β(z, t) = (t + z2 )−1 , z ∈ Z, t > 0. Then β(·, 0) equals
+∞ on ϕ−1 (F ) = R × {0}, and 1 on ϕ−1 (G) = R × {1}.
Theorem 5 implies that dom(Jβ ) equals

Deﬁnition 1. The conic core cnc(Q) of Q is the intersection
of all convex Borel cones with Q-negligible complements.
A predecessor of this construction appeared ﬁrst in [8]: the
convex core cc(Q) of Q is the intersection of all convex Borel
sets with Q-negligible complements. By [10, Theorem 3],

ri(F ) ∪ ri(cnϕ (µ)) = {(r, s, q) : r > q

0 , s ∈ R} .

Deﬁnition 2. The extension exn(Fβ ) of the family Fβ is
deﬁned as union of the families FF,β = {fF,ϑ : ϑ ∈ ΘF,β }
over the faces F of cnϕ (µ).

IV. D ISPENSING WITH THE PCQ IN THE PRIMAL PROBLEM
In this section, the primal problem is studied when the value
Jβ (a) is ﬁnite but the PCQ is not assumed, a ∈ ri(dom(Jβ )).
The main idea is to replace the measure µ by its restriction
to the set {ϕ ∈ cl(F )} ϕ−1 (cl(F )) where F is an appropriate face of the ϕ-cone cnϕ (µ). To indicate this, the letter
F is added to indices, e.g. GF,a denotes the class of Zmeasurable functions g : Z → [0, +∞) such that the integral
ϕg dµ exists and equals a.
{ϕ∈cl(F )}
For a face F of cnϕ (µ) and a ∈ Rd , the minimization in
JF,β (a)

Corollary 1. For a ∈ Rd with Jβ (a) ﬁnite the primal solution
ga exists if and only if the families exn(Fβ ) and Ga intersect,
in which case the intersection equals {ga }.
This corollary practically amounts to solving the equation
Z

over the faces F of cnϕ (µ) and ϑ ∈ ΘF,β .
The following result seems to be the most general version
of Pythagorean identity.

inf g∈GF,a HF,β (g) ,

where HF,β (g)
β(z, g(z)) µ(dz), is the F -primal
{ϕ∈cl(F )}
problem and the maximization in

Hβ (g) = Jβ (a) + Bβ (g, ga ) + Cβ (g) ,

g ∈ Ga .

The generalized primal solution ga in (9) is described explicˆ
itly by Theorem 6(iii).

where KF,β (ϑ)
β ∗ z, ϑ, ϕ(z) µ(dz), is the F {ϕ∈cl(F )}
dual problem for a. If the F -primal value JF,β (a) is ﬁnite and
attained then the minimizers vanishing outside {ϕ ∈ cl(F )}
deﬁne the µ-unique F -primal solution gF,a for a. The generalized F -primal solution gF,a is deﬁned likewise.
ˆ
Let the set ΘF,β consist of those ϑ ∈ dom(KF,β ) for which
the function r → β ∗ (z, r) is ﬁnite around r = ϑ, ϕ(z) for
µ-a.a. z ∈ Z with ϕ(z) ∈ cl(F ). For ϑ ∈ ΘF,β let fF,ϑ (z)
equal (β ∗ ) (z, ϑ, ϕ(z) ) if ϕ(z) ∈ cl(F ) and the derivative
exists, and zero otherwise.
The assumption ΘF,β = ∅ plays the role of DCQ in the
F -dual problem and is weaker than the DCQ for the original
problem (3). The role of PCQ in the F -primal problem for a
with Jβ (a) ﬁnite is played by the assumption that a ∈ ri(F ).
Under these assumptions, the standard results under PCQ and
DCQ imply attainment in the F -dual problem for a ∈ Rd ,
where each F -dual solution ϑ belongs to ΘF,β and gives rise
to the same function fF,ϑ . This function is referred to as the
∗
effective F -dual solution gF,a for a.

V. B REGMAN PROJECTIONS
This section is devoted to the minimization in
(10)

inf g∈Ga Bβ (g, h) ,

a ∈ Rd ,

an often emerging special case of (2).
The function h is assumed to be nonnegative, Z-measurable
and h(z) > 0 if β+ (z, 0) = −∞. Then, for t 0
(z, t) → β(z, t) − β(z, h(z)) − βsgn(t−h(z)) (h(z))[t − h(z)]
is an integrand denoted by [βh], and g → Bβ (g, h) = H[βh] (g)
is a functional of the form (1). It follows that the inﬁmum in
(10) equals J[βh] (a) and the minimization is in the framework
of the primal problem (2). A (generalized) primal solution is
renamed to a (generalized) Bregman projection of h to Ga .
The dual problem to (10) features the function K[βh] , see (4)
with β replaced by [βh]. The crucial set Θ[βh] consists of those
ϑ in dom(K[βh] ) that satisfy

For a ∈ cnϕ (µ) let F (a) denote the unique face of cnϕ (µ)
whose relative interior contains a.

ϑ, ϕ(z) < β (z, +∞) − β+ (z, h(z)) for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z .

d

Theorem 6. For a ∈ R such that Jβ (a) is ﬁnite

The DCQ holds because ϑ = 0 always belongs to Θ[βh] . The
family F[βh] is parameterized by ϑ ∈ Θ[βh] and consists of
the functions given µ-a.e. by

∗
(i) the F (a)-dual value KF (a),β (a) is attained and the pri∗
mal value Jβ (a) equals {ϕ∈cl(F (a))} β(·, 0) dµ + KF (a),β (a),
/

(ii) the primal solution ga exists if and only if ΘF (a),β is not

empty and the moment vector of gF (a),a exists and equals a,

f[βh],ϑ (z)

(β ∗ ) z, ϑ, ϕ(z) + βsgn(

ϑ,ϕ(z) ) (z, h(z))

.

In particular, f[βh],ϑ = h when ϑ = 0.
Since [βh]
0, the PCQ reduces to a ∈ ri(dom(J[βh] )).
Assuming J[βh] ≡ +∞, thus existence of a and g ∈ Ga with
Bβ (g, h) ﬁnite, the relative interiors of dom(J[βh] ) and cnϕ (µ)
coincide, by Theorem 5. Thus, the PCQ is equivalent to the
condition a ∈ ri(cnϕ (µ)), not depending on h.

(iii) the generalized primal solution ga exists if and only if
ˆ
∗
ΘF (a),β is not empty, in which case ga = gF (a),a .
ˆ
∗
If Jβ equals −∞ at some point then Jβ is identically +∞
and the dual problems (3) bear no information on the primal
ones. However, Theorem 6 makes sense since Jβ can still be
ﬁnite at some point a and the F (a)-dual problem provides
complete understanding of the primal problem for this a. This
situation is illustrated in [12, Example 10.7].

Theorems 6 and 7 can be reformulated as follows. In these
reformulations, in addition to restricting µ, the integrand β
is replaced by [βh], as indicated in indices. Accordingly,
(F, [βh])-problems, (F, [βh])-solutions, etc., come into play.

Lemma 5. For any nonnegative Z-measurable functions g, g

rentiable at t = h(z) for µ-a.a. z ∈ Z with h(z) > 0.
In particular, for β(z, ·) differentiable at each t > 0, z ∈ Z,
the two Bregman distances coincide. In that case, Theorem 9
implies that if the Bregman projection g[βh],a exists, then
Bβ (g, h)

(11)

Bβ (g, g[βh],a ) + Bβ (g[βh],a , h) , g ∈ Ga .

If β is even essentially smooth then h > 0, the correction term
in Theorem 9 vanishes, and (11) becomes an equality, which
is the usual Pythagorean identity for Bregman distances.
If β is not differentiable, the Pythagorean inequality (11)
may fail.
Example 3. Let β be autonomous, given by γ differentiable
except at t = 1, let µ be a probability measure on (Z, Z) and
ϕ ≡ 1. Then, Ga consists of the nonnegative Z-measurable
functions whose µ-integral equals a. For the function h ≡ 1
and a > 0, the Bregman distance Bβ (g, h) equals
Z

γ(g(z)) − γ(1) − γsgn(g(z)−1) (1)[g(z) − 1] dµ(z) .

This is minimized subject to g ∈ Ga when g ≡ a, by Jensen
inequality. In other words, the Bregman projection g[βh],a of h
to Ga exists and equals identically a. By a simple calculation,
Bβ (g, h) < Bβ (g, g[βh],a ) + Bβ (g[βh],a , h) ,
when 0 < a < 1,
not µ-negligible.

The choice h = fϑ , for some ϑ ∈ Θβ , meets the running
assumption and is of special interest.
Theorem 10. If β is differentiable, Jβ ≡ +∞ and ϑ ∈ Θβ
satisﬁes ϑ, ϕ β+ (·, 0), µ-a.e., then dom(Jβ ) = dom(J[βfϑ ] )
and for a ∈ dom(Jβ )
Bβ (g, fϑ ) = J[βfϑ ] (a) + Bβ (g, ga ) + Cβ (g) , g ∈ Ga .

This identity implies that the generalized primal solution ga

from Theorem 6(iii) coincides with the generalized Bregman
