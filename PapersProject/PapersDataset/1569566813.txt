message is the same as that in the Shannon cipher system.
Speciﬁcally, they proved a lower bound on the size of the key
which can be attained by a group code. This result is further
generalized in Cheng and Yeung [3] for an arbitrary A. They
proved a lower bound on the size of the key and showed that
it can be achieved by a linear code.
Imperfect secrecy was independently studied in Yamamoto
[10] and Yeung [11] (p. 116). The communication model
in [11] is the same as the model described in the Shannon
cipher system, except that the wiretapper can obtain partial
information about the message, which is measured by the
mutual information between the message and the symbols
obtained by the wiretapper. The imperfect secrecy theorem
states that this mutual information is lower bounded by the
difference between the size of the message and the size of the
key. In [10], Yamamoto studied source coding problems for
Shannon cipher system with correlated source outputs (X, Y )
by considering several situations such that both X and Y , only
X, or only Y must be transmitted to the receiver, or both
X and Y , only X, or only Y must be kept secret from the
wiretapper. The admissible region of the cryptogram rate and
the key rate for a given security level is derived for each case.
A result equivalent to the perfect secrecy theorem is proved
in the converse part. When imperfect security is considered
in a wiretap network G = (V, E), where V is the set of nodes
and E is the set of channels, Cai and Yeung in [2] proved
two tight bounds on the minimum length of the key and the
maximum length of the message, provided that the collection
A of all the possible wiretap sets consists of all the subsets of
E with size r and the information leakage about the message
in each wiretap set is at most i log q, where i is a ﬁxed integer
satisfying 0 ≤ i ≤ r and q is the size of the alphabet.
Xu and Chen in [9] studied how to communicate securely
over a network in which each channel may be noisy or noiseless. Their model is a single-source single-sink acyclic planar
network without network coding and the communication between the source and the sink is subject to non-cooperative
eavesdropping on each link, namely A consists of all the
subsets of the channel set with a singe channel. From each
wiretap set in A, the wiretapper can obtain partial information
about the message, which is measured by the wiretapper’s
equivocation. They deﬁned an achievable rate tuple including
the message rate, the key rate and the equivocation rate for
each wiretap set. They proved sufﬁcient conditions in terms
of the communication rates and the network parameters for
provably secure communication, along with an intuitive and

Abstract—In a point-to-point communication system which
consists of a sender s, a receiver t and a set of noiseless
channels, the sender s wants to transmit a private message to
the receiver t through the channels which may be eavesdropped
by a wiretapper. The wiretapper can access any one but not
more than one set of channels, which is referred to as a wiretap
set. It is assumed that from each wiretap set, the wiretapper
can obtain some partial information about the private message
which is measured by the wiretapper’s equivocation. The security
strategy is to encode the message with some random key. Under
these settings, we deﬁne an achievable rate tuple in terms of the
message, the key and the wiretapper’s equivocation, and prove
a tight rate region of the rate tuples.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Information-theoretic security was launched by Shannon in
his seminal paper [8], in which a sender wants to transmit
a private message to a receiver with the existence of a
wiretapper. This model, referred to as the Shannon cipher
system, requires that the wiretapper can obtain no information
about the message. In this paper, we will refer to it as perfect
security for ease of discussion. In order to protect the message,
the sender encodes the message with a random key which is
shared with the receiver a priori but unknown to the wiretapper.
The sender transmits the ciphertext on a public channel to the
receiver and the receiver can recover the message by the key
and ciphertext. For the wiretapper, it can obtain no information
about the private message without the key; i.e. the ciphertext
is statistically independent of the message. The conclusion,
known as the perfect secrecy theorem, is that the the size of
the key should be not less than the size of the message if
perfect security is required. A recent result by Ho et al. in [5]
showed an even stronger bound: in the Shannon cipher system,
the size of the key is lower bounded by the logarithm of the
cardinality of the message alphabet.
The Shannon cipher system was generalized to secret sharing by Blakley [1] and Shamir [7]. Ozarow and Wyner [6]
also studied a similar problem which they called the wiretap
channel II. In this model, information is sent to the receiver
through a set of point-to-point channels. It is assumed that
the wiretapper can access any one but not more than one set
of channels, called a wiretap set, out of a collection A of all
possible wiretap sets, where A is speciﬁed by the problem
under consideration. In [6], A consists of all the subsets of
the channel set with size r. The strategy to protect the private

efﬁcient coding scheme. Furthermore, the derived achievable
rate region is tight for several special cases. In the following,
we refer to this model as the non-cooperative imperfect secrecy
system.
In this work, we deﬁne a security model which generalizes
the model in [6]. The communication model is the same as
that in [6]. The main difference here is that in our model
A is arbitrary and from each wiretap set in A, the wiretapper
may obtain some information about the message. On the other
hand, our model subsumes the noiseless part of the model in
[9], since the communication in a single-source single-sink
network without network coding can be simpliﬁed as a pointto-point system. We also deﬁne an achievable rate tuple similar
to that in [9] and a tight rate region is proved under these
settings.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we give
the problem formulation and introduce some related results in
Section II. Then we present our main result on the rate region
in Section III including the converse and the achievability. At
last, we conclude in Section IV.

Deﬁnition 1. The encoder is a function f such that f :

that g : i=1 F → M × K. The corresponding rate tuple
(RM , RK , Ri:1≤i≤d ) is an achievable rate tuple if g ◦ f is the
identity function and (3) holds for all i = 1, 2, ..., d.
The rate region R is deﬁned as the set of all achievable
rate tuples (RM , RK , Ri:1≤i≤d ). In the sequel, we refer to
this model as a cooperative imperfect secrecy system.
Next, we deﬁne the achievable rate tuple by a block code
in terms of M , K and YIi , 1 ≤ i ≤ d.
Deﬁnition 2. A rate tuple of (RM , RK , Ri:1≤i≤d ) is achievable by block codes if there exists a sequence of (Mn , Kn )

where Mn ∈ Mn ⊆ Mn , Kn ∈ Kn ⊆ Kn , and YIi ,n ∈ F n .

The communication model in our problem is described as
follows:
• The communication is between a transmitter s and a
receiver t, which are connected by a set of point-to-point
noiseless channels. Let E = {e1 , e2 , ..., eh } be the set
of channels and h = |E|. Symbols transmitted on the
channels are from a common alphabet F and q = |F|.
For each channel ei , 1 ≤ i ≤ h, the channel capacity
is Ci log q, where Ci is an integer. Denote the symbols
transmitted on ei by Yei .
• The message M is generated at the transmitter s according to a uniform distribution on the message set M. The
key K, also generated at the transmitter s, takes value
in an alphabet K according to the uniform distribution,
and is independent of M . The transmitter needs to send
the ciphertext to the receiver and the receiver needs to
recover both the message and the key. The rates of the
message and the key are deﬁned as follows.

The inequality in (6) means that, for any positive real
number ε, there is a positive integer n0 such that
Ri − ε ≤

1 H(Mn |YIi ,n )

log q

for all n ≥ n0 .
In the sequel, we assume that the base of the logarithm in
the entropy quantities (e.g., H(X), I(X; Y )) is q. Then the
1
factor log q can be omitted in (1)-(6).

In the wiretap network model [2], the following result

Let A be the set of wiretap sets and d = |A|. For the
wiretapper, it can access at most one wiretap set in A.
For each wiretap set Ii , 1 ≤ i ≤ d, let YIi be the symbols
transmitted in Ii . It is required that the wiretapper’s

which is equivalent to (9).
2) Secure Coding over Networks: The system model in [9]
is a single-source single-sink directed acyclic network with the
assumption that each wiretapper can access only one channel
and there is no network coding in the network. Each channel
in the network may be noisy or noiseless.
When all the channels in the network are noiseless, the
network can be simpliﬁed as a point-to-point communication
system, in which each channel is a path from the source node
to the destination node in the original network and the set of
wiretap sets A is arbitrary. Hence our model subsumes the
non-cooperative model for this special case.
In [9], an achievable rate region of rate tuples was obtained
for noisy channels, and the region was shown to be tight for
several special cases. Based on the achievable rate region, they
also gave an algorithm for constructing a secure code on the
network.
In a network G = (V, E), a cut is a partition (W, W c ) of
the set of vertices V such that W ∪W c = V and W ∩W c = ∅,
and the cut-set is the set of the edges from W to W c . The
achievable rate region for noiseless channels is stated below.

A. Converse
In this section, we prove that if (RM , RK , Ri:1≤i≤d ) ∈ R,
then the constraints (11)-(16) hold. Since the converse is valid
for both the blocking coding and single-shot coding, we just
prove the single-shot coding for simplicity. The constraints
(13) and (14) are obvious.
We ﬁrst prove the constraint (12). By the constraint (3),
Ri ≤ H(M |YIi ) ≤ H(M ) = RM .

(17)

Hence the constraints (12)-(14) hold.
Let us consider an equivalent condition of constraint (3).
For all 1 ≤ i ≤ d, let
ci = RM − Ri = H(M ) − Ri .

(18)

The constraint (3) is equivalent to
I(YIi ; M ) ≤ H(M ) − Ri ,
or
0 ≤ I(YIi ; M ) ≤ ci .

Theorem 4 (Theorem 2, [9]). A rate tuple (RM , RK , Re ),
e ∈ E, is achievable, if there exist auxiliary numbers re such
that

(19)

By (17) and (18),
0 ≤ ci ≤ RM .
Next, we prove a lemma which generalizes Theorem 2.

0 ≤ re ≤ RM + RK ;

Lemma 1. In a cooperative imperfect secrecy system, let
M be the message, K be the key and YI be the symbols
transmitted in wiretap set I. Then

0 ≤ RM + RK ≤ min

Re ≤ RM + RK − re .

I(YI ; M ) = H(YI ) − H(YI |M )
In the above, Re and Ce correspond to Ri and Ci in our
formulation; ECut is the set of channels across a given cut

III. R ATE R EGION OF THE R ATE T UPLE

rate region R given by the following theorem.

In the next theorem, we prove the constraints (11), (15), and
(16).

B. Achievability
In this section, we prove that (RM , RK , Ri:1≤i≤d ) ∈ R if
there exists (r1 , r2 , ..., rh ) such that the constraints (11)-(16)
are satisﬁed.
In the following, a special code in which the symbols sent on
the channels are mutually independent is studied. We design a
block code with length n as follows. The sender generates M
and K at rates RM and RK , respectively, and sends symbols
on each channel ei (1 ≤ i ≤ h) at rate ri . Next, we prove that
the tuple (RM , RK , Ri:1≤i≤d ) can be attained by a linear
code.
Let the symbols on channel ei (1 ≤ i ≤ h) be Yei . For
simplicity, assume that the quantities ci , Ci , RM , RK , and ri
are all rationales, so that there is a sufﬁciently large n such
that

Proof: By Lemma 1 and the inequality (19), for each
wiretap set Ii ,
H(YIi ) − H(K) ≤ I(YIi ; M ) ≤ ci ,

For each channel ei , 1 ≤ i ≤ h,

nK = nRK = nH(K);

H(Yei ) ≤ Ci .

ni = nri = nH(Yei ), 1 ≤ i ≤ h.

Since Y(ei :1≤i≤h) is a function of (M, K) and (M, K) can be
recovered by Y(ei :1≤i≤h) ,
H(Y(ei :1≤i≤h) ) = H(M, K) = H(M ) + H(K).

In this paper, we have proved a tight rate region for the
cooperative imperfect secrecy model in terms of a linear
program, in which the key idea is from the imperfect secrecy
theorem. The result can be treated as a bound from a cut-set
if network coding is allowed in a general wiretap network.
Although for a general case, the rate region of rate tuples
is still open, our result has paved the way for the further
discussion on this problem.

Proof: The code can be constructed as follows:
Let the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq be the common alphabet of M and
K and the common alphabet of all the channels F = Fq . The
symbols transmitted on channel ei (1 ≤ i ≤ h) is taken from
n
Fq i , which means there are ni symbols from Fq transmitted
on ei . Let x1 , x2 , ..., xnM +nK be all the symbols to send,
where the ﬁrst n1 symbols are sent on e1 , the next n2 symbols
are sent on e2 , ..., and the last nh symbols are sent on eh . We
construct xi ’s according to their positions in the sequence.
Generate nK mutually independent symbols K =
(k1 , k2 , ..., knK ) from Fq . Transmit K at the ﬁrst nK positions,
i.e., 1, 2, ..., nK . Namely,
