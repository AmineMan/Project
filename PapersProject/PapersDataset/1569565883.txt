Abstract— We study LDPC codes for the channel with 2m -ary
input x ∈ Fm and output y = x + z ∈ Fm . The receiver knows
2
2
a subspace V ⊂ Fm from which z = y − x is uniformly chosen.
2
Or equivalently, the receiver receives an afﬁne subspace y − V
where x lies. We consider a joint iterative decoder involving the
channel detector and the LDPC decoder. The decoding system
considered in this paper can be viewed as a simpliﬁed model
of the joint iterative decoder over non-binary modulated signal
inputs e.g., 2m -QAM. We evaluate the performance of binary
spatially-coupled MacKay-Neal codes by density evolution. The
iterative decoding threshold is seriously degraded by increasing
m. EXIT-like function curve calculations reveal that this degradation is caused by wiggles and can be mitigated by increasing
the randomized window size. The resultant iterative decoding
threshold values are very close to the Shannon limit.

polar codes [6] and irregular LDPC codes [7]. According to the
channel, polar codes need frozen bit selection [6] and irregular
LDPC codes need optimization of degree distributions. We
note that recently Aref and Urbanke proposed SC rateless
codes [8] which are conjectured to universally achieve the
capacity of BMS channels without knowing even the capacity
of the channel at the transmitter.
MacKay-Neal (MN) codes [9] are non-systematic two-edge
type LDPC codes [10], [2]. The MN codes are conjectured
to achieve the capacity of BMS channels under maximum
likelihood decoding. Murayama et al. [11] and Tanaka and
Saad [12] reported the empirical evidence of the conjecture
for BSC (Binary Symmetric Channel) and AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channels, respectively by a nonrigorous but powerful statistical mechanics approach known
as replica method. In [13], Kasai and Sakaniwa presented a
spatial coupling method of SC-MN codes. Empirical results
showed that SC-MN codes with bounded density achieve the
capacity of the BEC. It was observed that the SC-MN codes
have the BP threshold close to the Shannon limit.
In this paper, we study coding over the channel with
2m -ary input x ∈ Fm and output y ∈ Fm . The receiver
2
2
knows a subspace V ⊂ Fm from which z = y − x is
2
uniformly chosen. Or equivalently, the receiver receives an
afﬁne subspace y − V := {y − z | z ∈ V } in which the
input x is compatible. This channel model is used in the
decoding process for network coding [14] after estimating
noise packet spaces. In [14], non-binary LDPC codes are used,
which results in high-decoding complexity O(m3 ) at each
channel factor node and parity-check nodes. We do not use
non-binary codes but binary codes for coding the non-binary
input channel. Furthermore, we consider the joint iterative
decoding between the channel detector and the code decoder.
The channel detector calculates log likelihood ratio (LLR) of
the transmitted bits from a channel output and messages from
the BP decoder. Such a decoding system can be viewed as
the simplest model of joint iterative decoders which involve
the channel detector of non-binary modulation (e.g., 2m -QAM
(quadrature amplitude modulation)) and the BP decoder for
LDPC codes.
The aim of this paper is to evaluate the joint iterative
decoding performance of binary SC-MN codes over the nonbinary input channels. To this end, we use density evolution
(DE) analysis for joint iterative decoding of binary SC-MN

I. I NTRODUCTION
Spatially-coupled (SC) low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes attract much attention due to their capacity-achieving
performance and a memory-efﬁcient sliding-window decoding
algorithm. The studies on SC-LDPC codes date back to the invention of convolutional LDPC codes by Felstr¨ m and Zigano
girov [1]. They introduced a construction method of (dl , dr )regular convolutional LDPC codes from (dl , dr )-regular block
LDPC codes [2]. The convolutional LDPC codes exhibited
better decoding performance than the underlying block LDPC
codes under a fair comparison with respect to the code length.
Lentmaier et al. observed that (4,8)-regular convolutional
LDPC codes exhibited the decoding performance surpassing
the belief propagation (BP) threshold of (4,8)-regular block
LDPC codes [3]. Further, the BP threshold coincides with the
maximum a posterior (MAP) threshold of the underlying block
LDPC codes with a lot of accuracy. Constructing convolutional
LDPC codes from a block LDPC code improves the BP
threshold up to the MAP threshold of the underlying codes.
Kudekar et al. named this phenomenon “threshold saturation” and proved rigorously for the binary-input erasure
channel (BEC) [4] and the binary-input memoryless outputsymmetric (BMS) channels. [5]. In the limit of large dl , dr , L
and w, the SC-LDPC code ensemble (dl , dr , L, w) [4] was
shown to universally achieve the Shannon limit of BMS
channels under BP decoding. This means the transmitter does
not need detail statistics of the channel but needs to know
only the channel capacity. Such universality is not supported
by other efﬁciently-decodable capacity-achieving codes, e.g.,

Let N denote the number of channel uses for one codeword,
in other words, at each channel use, an m-bit symbol is transmitted through the channel. The total number of transmitted
bits are n := mN . We use SC-MN codes of length n.
In this section, we deﬁne binary SC-MN codes. We deﬁne
a (dl , dr , dg , L, w) SC-MN code ensemble as follows. The
Tanner graph of a code in the (dl , dr , dg , L, w) SC-MN code
ensemble is constructed as follows. At each section i ∈ Z :=
{0, ±1, ±2, . . . }, consider dr M bit nodes of degree dl , M bit
dl
nodes of degree dg . We refer to those two types of bit nodes
as type 1 and type 2, respectively. Additionally, at each section
i, consider M check nodes which adjacent to dr bit nodes of
type 1 and dg bit nodes of type 2. Connect randomly these
nodes in such a way that for i ∈ Z and j = 0, . . . , w − 1, bit
nodes of type 1 at section i and check nodes at section i+j are
M
connected with drw edges and bit nodes of type 2 at section
d M
i and check nodes at section i + j are connected with g
w
edges. Shorten the bit nodes of type 1 and 2 at section |i| > L,
in other words, set the bits to zero and do not transmit them.
Puncture the bit nodes of type 1 at section |i| ≤ L, in other
words, the bits are not transmitted. Hereafter, we call bit nodes
of type 1 and 2, punctured and transmitted bits, respectively.
Note that this code ensemble is nicely represented as LDPC
codes deﬁned by a joint degree distribution [16]. The deﬁnition
of the (dl , dr , dg , L, w) SC-MN code ensemble is based on
that of (dl , dr , L, w) randomized SC-LDPC code ensemble.
For more details on (dl , dr , L, w) randomized SC-LDPC code
ensemble, we refer the readers to [4, Section II.B].
Denote the number of transmitted bit nodes, punctured
ˆ
nodes by Vt , Vp , respectively. n = Vt = LM, Vp =
dr ˆ
ˆ
LM, where L := 2L + 1. The number of check nodes

II. C HANNEL M ODEL
In this paper, we consider channels with input x ∈ Fm
2
and output y = x + z ∈ Fm , where z ∈ Fm is uniformly
2
2
distributed in a linear subspace V ⊂ Fm . We refer to this
2
subspace as noise subspace. The dimension of V is distributed
as Pr(dim(V ) = d) =: pd . Given the dimension d, V is
also uniformly distributed, i.e., Pr(V = v| dim(V ) = d) =

The normalized capacity per input bit is given by

max(I(X; Y )) =
max(H(Y ) − H(Y |X))

The latter part equals to H(Z) which is independent of p(X)
and the former part is maximized when X is uniformly
distributed. Hence, it follows that the normalized channel
m
d
capacity is given as 1 − d=0 m pd .
We consider two types of smooth channels deﬁned by pd .
The simplest dimension distribution is deterministic one. The
channel W(m, w) for w ∈ {0, 1, . . . , m} is deﬁned by
pd :=

1 (d = w),
0 (d = w).

W(m, w) for large m was used in a decoding process of
the network coding scenario [14]. In [14], the data part of
each packet is represented as x ∈ Fm . Packets are coded by
2
non-binary LDPC codes whose parity-check coefﬁcients are
in the general linear group GL(m, F2 ). The noise subspace
V is estimated by padding zero packets and using Gaussian
elimination. Note that, in this paper, unlike [14] we use binary
LDPC codes for coding the 2m -ary input channel. Note also
that, our DE calculation is currently limited for small m.
In order to evaluate the performance of a given coding and
decoding system, we prefer smoothly parametrized channels.
Instead of W(m, w), let us consider CD(m, ) as a smoothly
parametrized version of W(m, w), where CD stands for concentrated dimension.

IV. D ECODING A LGORITHM
In this section, we deﬁne a factor graph [17] for decoding
the SC-MN code over the channel. Denote a (dl , dr , dg , L, w)
SC-MN code by C. Denote the transmitted code symbols, punctured bits and the received symbols by x =
(x1 , . . . , xmN ) =: (x1 , . . . , xN ), z = (z1 , . . . , zVp ) and y =
(y 1 , . . . , y N ), respectively.
We adopt the sum-product algorithm [17] over a factor
graph deﬁned by the following factorization of P (x, z|y).

For m = w, W(m, w) is identical to CD(m, ). The normalized capacity of CD(m, ) is given by 1 − .
Another interesting non-binary input channel is BD(m, )
whose dimension distribution is given by the binomial distribution pd := m d (1 − )m−d , where BD stands for binomial
d
distribution. This channel is realized by multiplying random
m × m binary non-singular matrix A by the input bits x
before transmitting through the binary erasure channel with
erasure probability [15]. The afﬁne subspace is given by
{x : AE xT = AE c xT c }, where E ⊂ {1, . . . , m} is the set of
E
E
erased output indices, AE denotes the submatrix of A indexed
by the elements of E, and xE is the corresponding subvector.
The normalized capacity of BD(m, ) is given also as 1 − .

where ∂t k (resp. ∂p k) is the set of indices for transmitted
(resp. punctured) bit nodes adjacent to the k-th check node
of C, and #C represents the size of C. Figure 1 shows an
example of a factor graph representation of SC-MN codes with
dl = 4, dr = 2, dg = 2 over CD(m = 2, ) or BD(m = 2, ).
The calculation for message μi→im+j (xim+j ) from the
factor node ˆ of (1) to the variable node xim+1 is given by

the probability that a randomly picked message from the
transmitted bit nodes are erased by z. Denote the indices of
known messages by K. Note that 1 ∈ K. Deﬁne a subspace

i
efﬁciently accomplished by Gaussian elimination with O(m3 )
calculations. Since the factor node for each factor in (2) is a
check node. Hence, the messages stay in {0, 1, ?}.

Since bits whose indices in K are known, i.e., 0, D2 is
distributed over index support {1, . . . , m} \ K. The outgoing
message μ is known if the support of V2 does not include
1. By counting the number for subspace of dimension i and
i − 1 over the support of size k, we obtain the probability
Pμ|D2 ,D1 (?|k, i) that outgoing message is ? given that V2 has
dimension k and V1 has dimension i is given as follows.

Therefore, we have the probability f ,m (z) := P (μ = ?) that

The messages stay in {0, 1, ?} during the entire decoding
process. DE update equation for the check node is obvious.
First, we will focus on deriving the DE for the factor node ˆ

window size w. Note that scale is magniﬁed 100 times from left to right.
