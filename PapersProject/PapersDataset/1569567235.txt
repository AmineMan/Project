Abstract—A novel spatial model for extreme events is proposed.
The model may for instance be used to describe the occurrence
of catastrophic events such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, or hurricanes
in certain regions; it may therefore be relevant for, e.g., weather
forecasting, urban planning, and environmental assessment. The
model is derived from the following ideas: The above-threshold
values at each location are assumed to follow a generalized Pareto
(GP) distribution. The GP parameters are coupled across space
through Markov random ﬁelds, in particular, thin-membrane
models. The latter are inferred through an empirical Bayes
approach. Numerical results are presented for synthetic and real
data (related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico).

GP parameters depend on the location. The thresholds are
determined through quantile regression, using Legendre polynomials. Our proposed model is similar in spirit, but is based
on graphical models instead of polynomial regression.
In the model proposed here, the threshold exceedance
at each location is modeled by the GP distribution. Thinmembrane models characterize the variation of the GP parameters across space. We then follow an empirical Bayes
approach, inferring the smoothness parameters of the thinmembrane models using expectation maximization (EM).
Numerical results for synthetic and real data (related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico) show that the proposed spatial
extreme model can indeed capture spatial variations in the
characteristics of extreme events. By inferring the smoothness
parameters of the thin-membrane model, the smoothness is
adjusted automatically in a suitable manner. In some numerical
examples, the MRF-GP model yields location-independent GP
shape and scale parameters, while the GP threshold is location
dependent. Spatial variations in the characteristics of extreme
events are then fully captured by only varying the threshold in
space, resulting in a model with signiﬁcantly fewer parameters.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we brieﬂy
review the GP distribution and thin-membrane model, which
are the main components of the proposed model. The model
itself is explained in detail in Section III. Numerical results on
synthetic and real datasets are brieﬂy presented in Section IV.
We offer concluding remarks in Section V.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Statistical models can help to assess the likelihood of
extreme events [1], such as earthquakes, ﬂoods, or hurricanes,
and the dependency among the events (see, e.g., [1], [2], [3]).
The models may serve as quantitative tools to assess the risks
associated with certain infrastructures and facilities exposed
to extreme conditions.
Extreme value theory provides a solid basis for analyzing
extreme events [1]. The Pickands-Balkema-de Haan (PBdH)
theorem, often called the second theorem in extreme value
theory [4], states that for a large class of unknown underlying
distribution functions F of a random variable X , the conditional excess distribution Fu , for a large threshold u, is well
approximated by the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution.
The characteristics (e.g., GP parameters) of extreme events
often vary systematically with a number of covariates. For
example, the characteristics of extreme waves in hurricane
dominated areas vary systematically with location, time, and
storm direction [5], [6]. Those covariates need to be incorporated in extreme value models. In this paper, we propose to
use graphical models to capture spatial covariate effects.
So far, spatial extreme models have only received limited
attention. It is common practice to locally ﬁt the GP parameters, without exploiting the spatial dependency, leading
to inaccurate characterization of the extreme events. In the
following, we brieﬂy review the literature on spatial extreme
models. In [2] a procedure is proposed to compute the pairwise
spatial dependence of extreme events, i.e., the probability of
threshold exceedance at one site conditioned on exceedance
at one other site [3]. Alternatively, Naveau et al. [7] quantify
pairwise spatial dependence through the concept of variogram.
Both studies are limited to pairwise dependency. Recently,
Northrop et al. [6] proposed a parametric model where the

II. P RELIMINARIES
In this section, we give a short description of the generalized
Pareto (GP) distribution and the thin-membrane model.
A. Generalized Pareto Distribution
We consider a random variable X with unknown distribution F . We are interested in inferring the conditional excess
distribution function Fu . If the selected threshold u is high
enough, for a large class of distributions F , the conditional
excess distribution function Fu converges to a generalized
Pareto (GP) distribution [4]:

for x ≥ u and 1 + γ/σ(x − u) ≥ 0, where γ ∈ R is the shape
parameter and σ > 0 is the scale parameter.
If the random variable X has a GP distribution for a ﬁxed
threshold u, the conditional distribution of X −t, given X ≥ t,
corresponding to a higher threshold u+t, also has a GP distribution. The shape parameter γt of the conditional distribution
remains unchanged, i.e., γt = γ, while the scale parameter σt
is a linear function of the threshold, i.e., σt = σ + γt.

B. Thin-Membrane Model

V

A Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) or a graphical model is a
collection of random variables indexed by the vertices of an
undirected graph G = (V, E). Each node i ∈ V is associated
with a random variable Xi . An edge (i, j) is absent if the corresponding two variables Xi and Xj are conditional independent: P (Xi , Xj |XV|i,j ) = P (Xi |XV|i,j )P (Xj |XV|i,j ), where
V|i, j denotes all the variables except Xi and Xj . In particular,
for Gaussian distributed X, the graph G is characterized by
the inverse of the covariance matrix (precision matrix) K, i.e.,
K(i, j) = 0 if and only if the edge (i, j) ∈ E [8].
The thin-membrane model is a Gaussian MRF that is
commonly used as smoothness prior. Such model tries to
minimize the difference between neighbors, and its probability
density function (pdf) can be written as:

Suppose that we have n samples xi at each of the p
locations, where i = 1, · · · , p and j = 1, · · · , n. Our objective
is to infer the three parameters u, γ, and σ.
Let y = (y1 , y2 , . . . , yp ) denote the “observed” value of z =
(z1 , z2 , . . . , zp ), where z is either u, γ or σ. In our approach,
the “observed” yi are computed at each site i from the n
observed samples at that site. We model the observations as
y = z +b, where b ∼ N (0, Rz ) is a zero-mean Gaussian white
noise with a diagonal covariance matrix Rz .
Since we assume that the prior distribution of z is a thinmembrane model (cf. (2)), the posterior distribution is given
by:

(2)

where N (i) denotes the neighboring nodes of node i, and α
is the smoothness parameter. The matrix Kp is the adjacency
matrix: its diagonal elements [Kp ]i,i are equal to the number
of neighbors of site i and its off-diagonal elements [Kp ]i,j
equal −1 if the sites i and j are adjacent and 0 otherwise.
III. S PATIAL E XTREME M ODEL
In this section, we introduce our novel spatial extreme
model (denoted as MRF-GP model), which is based on the
following two assumptions:

1
−1
P (z|y) ∝ exp(−αz z T Kp z) exp{− (y − z)T Rz (y − z)}
2
1
−1
−1
∝ exp{− z T (αz Kp + Rz )z + z T Rz y}.
(3)
2
The maximum a posteriori estimate of z is then given by:

1) The threshold exceedance at each site follows a GP
distribution (1) with threshold ui , shape parameter γi ,
and scale parameter σi .
2) Spatial dependence is captured by the spatial-dependent
parameters u = (u1 , · · · , up ), γ = (γ1 , · · · , γp ),
σ = (σ1 , · · · , σp ), where p is the number of sites.
Speciﬁcally, the three parameter vectors u, γ, and σ
each have a thin-membrane model as prior. Conditioned
on the spatially dependent GP parameters, the extreme
values at different sites are mutually independent.

−1
z = argmax P (z|y) = (αz Kp + Rz )−1 Rz y.
ˆ

In the following, we discuss how the “observed” value y,
the noise covariance matrix Rz , and the smoothing parameter
αz are computed for each of the three parameters u, γ, and
σ.

Fig. 1 shows the factor graph of our model [9]. For
simplicity, we depict the GP pdf of only one site on the grid
(node indicated by “GP”). The three rectangular lattices on
the right hand side represent the thin-membrane models; the
nodes αz represent the factors exp{−αz (zi − zj )2 }, where z
stands for either u, γ or σ.

A. Local Observations of z
The thresholds ui are selected so that the probability of
ˆ
threshold exceedance is identical (e.g., 5%) at all locations.
The resulting thresholds are considered as local observations.

The local observed value of γ and σ is the vector of local

maximum likelihood (ML) estimates (γi ML , σi ML ) at each site,

IV. R ESULTS

From a message-passing perspective, the local estimates
σi ML and γi ML are chosen as the means of the Gaussian
ˆ
ˆ
messages leaving the GP node along the σ and γ edges
respectively, towards the thin-membrane subgraphs associated
with σ and γ respectively [9].

In this section, we apply the MRF-GP model to synthetic and real data. We compare it to a locally ﬁt model,
where the parameters u = (u1 , · · · , up ), γ = (γ1 , · · · , γp ),
σ = (σ1 , · · · , σp ) are all locally ﬁt through ML estimation
(cf. (5)(6)), without taking spatial priors into account. We
compare the MRF-GP and the locally ﬁt model based on three
criteria:
1) We verify whether the shape parameter γi is independent
of the threshold ui , and the scale parameter σi depends
linearly on ui (cf. Section II-A).
2) We investigate how the shape and scale parameters depend on the threshold smoothness parameter αv . Earlier
studies suggest that a properly selected threshold surface
(sometimes combined with scale surface) is sufﬁcient to
capture the spatial variation, and as a consequence, the
shape surface may be ﬂat [6].
3) We compute the 95% conﬁdence interval of all estimates
by bootstrapping.

B. Covariance Matrices Rz
We use the bootstrap approach (as in [12]) to infer the
noise covariance matrices Ru , Rγ and Rσ , and also the 95%
conﬁdence interval of the estimates of γ and σ as follows:
1) We generate m sample sets S1 , · · · , Sm , each with size
n × p, by resampling at random with replacement from
the original n observations (at each of the p locations).
2) The thresholds uk = (uk , · · · , uk ) are estimated by
p
1
ﬁxing the same quantile value (e.g., 5%) for each of the
m subsets Sk , where k = 1, · · · , m. With that choice
k
k
of thresholds uk , the parameters γ k = (γ1 , · · · , γp ),
k
k
k
and σ = (σ1 , · · · , σp ) are estimated using ML method
(cf. (5)(6)) for each Sk .
3) The variance of uk (k = 1, · · · , m) at site i is our
i
estimate of [Ru ]i,i , with i = 1, . . . , p. Similarly, we
obtain estimates of the diagonal covariance matrices Rγ
and Rσ .
4) The 95% conﬁdence interval for γ and σ is estimated
as the values corresponding to the 2.5% and 97.5%
quantiles of γk and σk .
From a message-passing perspective, the diagonal elements
of Ru , Rγ and Rσ are the covariances of the Gaussian
messages leaving the GP node towards the thin-membrane
subgraphs [9].

A. Synthetic Data
Here we present results for two case studies with synthetic
data. Samples are drawn from GP marginals with locationdependent parameters. In both cases, the threshold surface is a
quadratic Legendre polynomial, as shown in Fig. 2(a), whereas
the shape and scale parameters are chosen differently in each
case.

C. Smoothing Parameters α
The smoothness parameters αz are hyperparameters in the
overall model. Through EM we obtain point estimates of those
hyperparameters, whereas we infer the posterior distributions
of z. Such procedure corresponds to an empirical Bayes
approach [10].
In the E-step, we compute [13]:

We consider the GOMOS (Gulf of Mexico Oceanographic
Study) data [14], which consists of 315 peak wave height values corresponding to hurricane events in the Gulf of Mexico.
There are 78 sites arranged on a 6×13 rectangular lattice with
spacing of 0.125◦ (approximately 14km).
The MRF-GP model yields more accurate GP parameter
estimates than local ﬁtting: The MRF-GP estimates of γ and
σ again follow the predicted dependency on the threshold u
more closely than the local estimates, and the 95% conﬁdence
intervals are narrower (not shown here). However, also for

2) Case Study 2: In the second case study, we extend the
scale parameter surface to be quadratic, as shown in Fig. 2(b),
however, the shape parameter γ remains the value -0.3 as in
the previous case study. We wish to verify whether the MRFGP model can capture the additional spatial dependence. The
results are qualitatively similar to the ones of the ﬁrst case
study. The only difference is that the estimates of σ are no
longer independent of location (Fig. 6), which is not surprising
since the true parameters σ follow a quadratic surface. In
other words, by inferring ασ and αγ , the spatial smoothness
of σ and γ can automatically and appropriately be adjusted.
The MRF-GP estimates are more accurate than the local ML
estimates, as shown in Fig 5(b), although the improvement is
less pronounced than in Case Study 1 (cf. Fig 5(a)).

the predicted dependency on the threshold more closely: the
shape parameter γ is nearly independent of the threshold u,
whereas the scale parameter σ scales linearly with u (cf.
Section II-A). Clearly, the local ML estimates ﬂuctuate more,
and hence are less reliable. Moreover, the MRF-GP estimates
have narrower conﬁdence intervals compared to the local ML
estimates. Interestingly, Fig. 4 shows that for a large range of
the threshold smoothing parameter αu , the estimates of γ and
σ do not depend on location, which is also the case for the true
parameter values. On the other hand, the local ML estimates
are signiﬁcantly different at each site. Fig. 5(a) shows the mean
square error (MSE) of the local and MRF-GP estimates, as a
function of αu : the MSE of the MRF-GP estimates is more
than a order of magnitude smaller than the MSE of the local
estimates.

R EFERENCES

the MRF-GP, the parameter γ signiﬁcantly depends on the
threshold u, which is also an issue for the approach of [6].
Consequently, selecting a threshold quantile is a delicate issue
for the data set at hand. Interestingly, Fig. 7 shows that the
MRF-GP estimates of the parameters γ and σ are identical
for each site. The variation of the GP marginals across space
can be captured effectively by a spatial-dependent threshold
u only. Consequently, the MRF-GP model has vastly fewer
parameter than for local ﬁtting (where all parameters are
location-dependent), but achieves about the same loglikelihood
(for a wide range of quantiles). Therefore, the MRF-GP model
is preferred over local ﬁtting for the GOMOS data.

V. C ONCLUSION
We introduced a novel spatial extreme model: the marginal
excess probabilities are assumed to be GP distributions,
and thin-membrane models serve as priors for the locationdependent GP parameters. The smoothness of the GP parameters across space can automatically be inferred from the data.
In some cases, certain GP parameters may be become locationindependent.
