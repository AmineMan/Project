mapping from Fpn into the subﬁeld Fpe (and, respectively,
from Fpe into Fp ). For simplicity, we denote Trn (x) (and,

Abstract—In this paper, for an odd prime p and positive
integers n, m and e, we present two families of p-ary sequences
from decimated Helleseth-Gong sequences and m-sequences and
examine their correlation properties. The proposed families of
sequences possess low correlation and large linear complexity
properties.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Pseudorandom sequences with good correlation properties
have many applications in modern communication systems and
cryptography, such as radar, CDMA communication systems,
and stream cipher cryptosystems [1, 6, 16]. For odd prime
p, many families of p-ary sequences of period pn − 1 have
been reported to have good correlation properties and large
linear complexity [4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17–20]. Among
those well-known p-ary sequence families, most of them
are generated by the m-sequences and other sequences with
good autocorrelation properties. For p-ary sequences with twolevel autocorrelation, without using a subﬁeld constructions,
there is only one general construction for any arbitrary odd
prime p, which is the m-sequences. Helleseth and Gong [5]
presented a construction of p-ary sequences with ideal twolevel autocorrelation for any odd p, which generalized the
ternary family in [7]. Henceforth, we refer to this family of
sequences as Helleseth-Gong sequences. Very recently, it was
shown in [2, 3] that the cross-correlation functions between
m-sequence and the decimated Helleseth-Gong sequences for
some decimations were three-level valued.
In this paper, we employ p-ary Helleseth-Gong sequences
and m-sequences, which possess optimal auto-correlation
property, to construct two new families of sequences of period
pn − 1 with low correlation and large linear complexity. With
the examination of the rank of certain quadratic forms, it
is shown that the ﬁrst family of sequences has ﬁve-level
nontrivial correlation property, the second one has family size
pn (pn + 1)/2, and the magnitude of nontrivial correlations of
both of them is upper bounded by 1 + p(n+3e)/2 .

where ω is the p-th root of unity given by ω = e p . In
particular, we denote the cross correlation of a with itself at
shift τ by Aa (τ ), which is the autocorrelation of a. A sequence
a of period N is said to have an ideal two-level autocorrelation
if Aa (τ ) = −1 for any τ = 0 (mod N ).
Let S be a family of M sequences of period N . The
maximum correlation value of the family S is deﬁned as
Cmax = max{|Ca,b (τ )| : a, b ∈ S, τ = 0 or (τ = 0, a = b)|}.
The quadratic form over the ﬁnite ﬁeld with odd characteristic has been well analyzed in [11]. It should be noted that the
rank of a quadratic form is the minimum number of variables
required to represent the function under the nonsingular coordinate transformations. Let Q(x) be a quadratic form from
Fq2m+1 to Fq and B(x, y) = Q(x + y) − Q(x) − Q(y) be its
associated bilinear form. Then the rank ρ of Q(x) is related
to the dimension of the vector space W in Fq2m+1 , i.e.,
W = {y ∈ Fq2m+1 | B(x, y) = 0 for all x ∈ Fq2m+1 }.
More precisely, ρ = 2m + 1 − dim(W).
Lemma 1. ([5]) Let p(x) be a polynomial with coefﬁcients
in Fpn such that p(λx) = λp(x) for any λ ∈ Fpe . Let k
be a positive integer such that gcd(k, pn − 1) = 2 and k ≡
2 (mod pe − 1). Then,

We give below the main results of this paper.

SEQUENCES

In order to determine the rank ρ of Q(x), we need to
investigate the number of y ∈ Fq2m+1 such that the associated
bilinear form B(x, y) = Q(x + y) − Q(x) − Q(y) = 0 for all
x ∈ Fq2m+1 , i.e.,

In this section, we deﬁne two families of p-ary sequences
by adopting Helleseth-Gong sequences and m-sequences and
examine their correlation and linear complexity properties.

where the coefﬁcients ai ∈ Fq2m+1 for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Hence,
all roots of the linearized polynomial L(y) are roots of the
polynomial L3 (y). It follows again from Lemma 4 that the
solution space of L3 (y) = 0 has dimension at most 4 over Fq
since gcd((m + 1)s, 2m + 1) = 1. This implies the solution
space of L(y) = 0 has dimension at most 4 over Fq .
Thus, all possible ranks of Q(x) for any δ = 1, λ ∈ Fq2m+1
take values in the set {2m + 1 − i : i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
The proof of Proposition 2 is similar in spirit to that of
Proposition 3, and it is omitted due to page limitation.

It follows from Lemma 4 that the solution space of L1 (y) = 0
has dimension at most 2 over Fq since gcd((m+1)s, 2m+1) =

dimension at most 2 over Fq . Consequently, the quadratic form
Q(x) has rank at least 2m − 1 in the case of γ ∈ Fq .

When w1 − w2 δ q

1), the quadratic form Q(x) has rank either 2m + 1 or 2m,
and then |1 + Cb1 ,b2 (τ )| ∈ {0, pn/2 , p(n+e)/2 }. When w1 −

takes value p − 1 if δ = 1, or −1 otherwise; and in the case

of δ q
= 1, it is direct that Cb1 ,b2 (τ ) = −1.
Sumarizing the above three cases completes the proof.

By a straightforward application of the results in [9], we
have the following theorem:
Theorem 4. The linear span LS(ai ) of the sequences ai in
the family A deﬁned in (2) is as follows:

n(m + 1), if 0 ≤ i ≤ pn − 2,

LS(ai ) = nm,
if i = pn − 1,


n,
if i = pn .
The linear span LS(b) of the sequences b(t) in the family B
deﬁned in (4) satisﬁes:
LS(b) =

n(m + 2),
2n,

if b(t) ∈ B1 ,
if b(t) ∈ B2 .

Deﬁne a sequence family A as
A = {ai (t) | 0 ≤ i ≤ pn − 1},
where ai (t) is deﬁned as in (3).
Similar to the method in [17], it is easy to show that the
family A is optimal with respect to the Welch bound in term
of root mean square of all nontrivial correlations, which is
considered as an important performance factor in practice [13].
Theorem 5. The family A satisfy the Welch bound with
equality
