alphabets, there are a number of existing sequence designs
with good autocorrelation. In our paper from ISIT 2011 [2]
we have started examining single sequences and sequence
designs from the point of view of LPI properties via their
triple correlation function. We continue this line of research
in this paper.
The paper is organised as follows. In Section II, we provide
a brief overview of Galois ﬁeld arithmetic, after introducing
some deﬁnitions and notation for general sequence designs,
and we brieﬂy discuss the existing literature on triple correlation properties. In Section III we obtain new results on
the triple correlation properties for some binary sequence
families–namely the gold-like sequences with quadratic linear
span which form the Most Signiﬁcant Bit of the quaternary
Family A design, and the binary bent function sequences of
Olsen et al [7]. Section IV concludes the paper.

Abstract—The design of pseudorandom sequences with optimal
correlation properties forms a crucial part of communications
and radar engineering. With the increasingly crowded electromagnetic spectrum, interference between different systems
is becoming more important. In this paper, we consider the
Low Probability of Intercept properties of some commonly used
sequence families, with respect to their triple correlation function.
The binary families we consider include the Gold sequence family,
the Gold-like sequence family with quadratic span, and the Bent
Function sequence family.

I. I NTRODUCTION
With the advent of wireless communications, the design of
new sequences with perfect periodic autocorrelation, and more
ﬂexible parameters, such as length and alphabet size is of increasing signiﬁcance in applications including various ﬂavours
of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communications
and Radar.
The basic aim of CDMA in is to enable wireless transmitters
to successfully exchange information in the presence of potential conﬂicts which lead to interference. With the increasing
numbers of users, and the increasing data rates resulting from
real-time wireless services such as audio and video download,
the demands on wireless networks is exponentially increasing.
There are two main ﬂavours of CDMA, Frequency Hopping (FH) and Direct Sequence (DS). For details of CDMA
networks, we refer the interested reader to the survey in the
Spread Spectrum Communications Handbook by Simon et. al.
[8] and for sequence construction methods we recommend the
more recent survey [6] as well.
In this paper, we shall be concerned with the so-called
“spreading codes” in DS-CDMA, and speciﬁcally their Low
Probability of Intercept (LPI) properties, which also helps
characterize the interference they present on different systems
they may co-exist with, or helps characterize their suitability
for communications in high-security applications, where passive bandwidth monitors may want to scan for the presence of
a communications signal. The motivation for studying triple
correlation will be further discussed in Section II.A.
For the symbol alphabets of practical interest, such as the
√
binary ({±1}) and quaternary ({±1, ±i} with i = −1)

II. D EFINITIONS AND BACKGROUND
We consider a complex sequence of period (length) N , say
x = (x(0), . . . , x(N − 1)) in CN .
There is a large literature dealing with sequence design and
the applications of such sequences; see, e.g., [3], [6], [9] and
the references therein.
Traditionally, sequences with good correlation have also
been investigated with respect to antijam properties, and low
probability of intercept (LPI), low probability of detection
(LPD) communications. In the context of current developments
in wireless transmission, with more and more complicated
signal structures, the LPI/LPD properties of sequences can be
looked at from two points of view.
A sequence with good LPI/LPD properties (difﬁcult to
detect) is good in the crowded wireless environment, it affords
some physical level security, and its interference to other
systems, signal bearers, is mitigated.
In this section we ﬁrst deﬁne traditional and triple correlations (Cx,y (τ ) and θx (τ, δ) respectively).
Deﬁnition 1. The traditional (periodic) correlation between

by the initial values s(0), . . . , s(m − 1) and a recursion of
order m, and is given by

two complex sequences of length N is given by
N −1

x(t ⊕ τ )y(t)

Cx,y (τ ) =

s(t) = T r(aαt ),

t=0

where z denotes the complex conjugate of z and ⊕ denotes
addition modulo N.

A. Motivation for Triple Correlation
In typical LPI/LPD applications, the sequence designs used
are carefully chosen in order to have favourable low offpeak correlation. Such designs can operate in complex radio
environments of high noise, interference, jamming and other
co-channel signals. All this makes the interception of such
communications very difﬁcult, which motivates the designers
of interception equipment to search for alternative higherorder techniques of sequence detection. The triple correlation
enables the easier detection of the LPI/LPD signals–since there
are many peaks in the (τ, δ) plane.
It is thus of interest to advance the study of typical sequences with good correlation properties with respect to triple
correlation.

x(t ⊕ τ )x(t ⊕ δ)x(t),
t=0
N −1

x(t ⊕ τ )x(t ⊕ δ)x(t).

Depending on the properties of the sequences under consideration, it is possible that one of other of these deﬁnitions
make more sense. However, we shall not dwell on this any
further since we shall only consider real-valued sequences in
this paper.
Deﬁnition 2. The (periodic) triple autocorrelation of a real
valued sequence of length N is given by

B. Related Work
The triple correlation properties of maximal length sequences were obtained by Warner et al [11] and were also
discussed by the authors [2] who also obtained computational
results on the triple autocorrelation of Legendre and GMW
sequences and partial theoretical results on the triple autocorrelation of Gold sequences. This work is advanced here by
providing full proofs of the triple autocorrelation of Gold and
Legendre sequences, as well as those of the Gold-like MSB
sequences of Family A. Finally, we remark that related work
has appeared in [5] under the term “higher order correlation”.

where ⊕ denotes addition modulo N.
Before proceeding further we review some standard results
from ﬁnite ﬁeld arithmetic. Let q = pk be a power of a prime
and let the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements be denoted by Fq . Then
mk
the trace function T rk (x) (which we denote by T r(x) for
simplicity) is a mapping from the extension ﬁeld Fqm = Fpmk
to the ﬁeld Fq given by:
2

T r(x) = xq + xq + · · · + xq

m−1

(1)

If a = 0, then we get the all zero sequence. Otherwise the
period is pm − 1 which is the maximal possible and the
sequences in (1) are cyclic shifts of each other, since any
nonzero a = αi for some 0 ≤ i ≤ q m − 2.

The triple correlation is deﬁned analogously, but with two
time lags instead of one. Even when we restrict ourselves to
autocorrelations, the exact deﬁnition for complex signals is
somewhat arbitrary, since any of the following two expressions
(up to equivalence) is acceptable:

or

a ∈ Fpm .

The trace function satisﬁes the following:
(i) T r(ax + by) = aT r(x) + bT r(y), for all a, b ∈ Fq ,
x, y ∈ Fqm .

(ii) T r(xq ) = T r(x), for all x ∈ Fqm .
(iii) For any b ∈ Fq we have

A. Legendre Sequences
Legendre sequences have ideal autocorrelation since they
are essentially the characteristic functions of cyclic Hadamard
difference sets, whenever their length p ≡ 3 (mod 4). However, it is not immediately clear how to analytically compute
the Θ(τ, δ) distribution for them. In [2] we experimentally
observed that, unlike the m-sequences x(t) of period 2n − 1
which have a full peak for every nontrivial row and column
in the triple correlation array {Θx (τ, δ) : 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2n − 2, 1 ≤
τ ≤ 2n − 2}, i.e., ∀δ = 0, there is a unique τ = 0
(actually τ = logα (1 + αδ ) if the m-sequence has primitive
characteristic polynomial Mα (X)), Legendre sequences did
not have a full-peak. We provide a short informal proof here.
The Legendre sequence f (t) is deﬁned via the quadratic
multiplicative character of the group Z∗ as f (x) = χ(x)
p

#{x ∈ Fqm : T r(x) = b} = q m−1 .
(iv) Let a ∈ Fqm . If T r(ax) = 0 for all x ∈ Fqm then a = 0.
Let α in Fqm have multiplicative order q m − 1. A nonzero
sequence (s(t))t≥0 with elements from Fq generated by the
recursion corresponding to f (x) ∈ Fq [x], the primitive polynomial which has α as its root is called a maximal length
sequence. We shall call such sequences an m-sequences for
brevity, where the “m” in the short name is unrelated to m, the
exponent of q above. The sequence is completely determined

2

when x ∈ Z∗ and by extending it to zero by χ(0) = 1. This
p
immediately gives

Case 2 If both of τ and δ are nonzero and equal we get
2n − 1 − wk again since the gk (t + τ ) and gk (t + τ ) terms are
identical and cancel, similar to Case 1 above.
The cases below concern τ and δ both nonzero:
Case 3 Now, for most choices of (τ, δ) the constants
(αZ(aδ) + αaτ ) and (αZ(aδ) + αaτ ) will both be nonzero, and
in that case we get a distribution whose correlation values are
the same as the regular Gold cross correlation values, but the
number of occurences of each value along a row/column varies
considerably, according to the sampling that happens from
different gold functions based on the exact value of (τ, δ, k)
that must be considered. We refer to rows and columns since
we can visualize the Θ(τ, δ) distribution as a 2 dimensional
array indexed by (τ, δ) ∈ [0, 2n − 2] × [0, 2n − 2].
Case 4 When exactly one of the two equations below hold
modulo 2n − 1:

p−1

Θf (τ, δ) =

χ[x + τ ]χ[x + δ]χ[x]
x=0

or

p−1

χ[x3 + (τ + δ)x2 + τ δx]

Θf (τ, δ) =
x=0

and since the Hasse-Weil theorem states that unless a polynomial of degree d over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq is of the form c(h(x))s
then a multiplicative character sum for a character η of order
s (here s = 2, and Fq = Zp ), (which by deﬁnition is zero at
x = 0 satisﬁes)
√
η(f (x)) ≤ (d − 1) q.

Z(aδ) = aτ

x∈Fq

Here we have three zeroes, when x = 0, x = −τ and x = −δ
where the traditional character sum would have had value zero
but we have deﬁned our f (x) to be 1 at those places, but this
can only change the sum by a total of 6 [by changing from
+1 to -1]. Hence we have:

and

Z(δ) = τ

(2)

we again get a sampling from Gold cross correlation values
along a row/column.
In last year’s paper [2] we noted that in general when one
of the equations in (2) holds, the other one does not, since
the pseudorandom permutation induced on Z∗n −1 by Z(·) is
2
unlikely to preserve points under multiplication by a. We can
now state a necessary and sufﬁcient condition which rules out
full peaks of Θ(τ, δ) = 2n − 1 for δ and τ both nonzero,
and makes the Gold sequences resilient with respect to LPI
properties.

Theorem 1. The nontrivial triple correlation function of
Legendre sequences satisﬁes the bound
√
|Θf (τ, δ)| ≤ 2 p + 6
Thus the Legendre sequences are less detectable than the
other sequences discussed in this section, with respect to
LPI/LPD techniques since maximum absolute value peaks (of
2n − 1) in | Θf (τ, δ) | don’t occur for them.

Theorem 2. Let a = 2e + 1, where gcd(2e + 1, 2n − 1) = 1.
Then the two equations in (2) are simultaneously satisﬁed if
and only if e|n.

B. Gold Sequences

The proof follows by observing that the following chain of
equalities (modulo 2):

We now consider the Θ(τ, δ) distribution for Gold sequences. Some of this was covered in [2] but we provide it
n
here for completeness. Note that if (gk (t)) = T r1 (αt+k +αat )
n
denotes a binary Gold sequence with period 2 − 1 and with
decimation a where gcd(a, 2n − 1) = 1, with 0 ≤ k ≤ 2n − 2,
then we can write

⇔

αaδ = (ατ + 1)

αδ = ατ + 1

implies that for both equations in (2) to hold we must have
e
e
α2 τ +ατ = ατ (α(2 −1)τ +1) = 0 which is impossible unless
2e − 1 divides 2n − 1. But this happens if and only if e divides
n. And in that case, the values of τ = kT where k ≥ 1 is
an integer and T = (2n − 1)/(2e − 1) will yield a peak of
2n − 1 in Θ(τ, δ). Note that when this peak happens, one of
the regular Gold correlation values will be “missing” along
the same row/column.
Thus in some sense the Gold sequences are more secure
than the m-sequences from this point of view and are similar
to Legendre sequences.

and Kumar [4], and the results indicate that the triple correlation is also Gold-like, i.e., like the distributions discussed in
the subsection above, but less widely scattered in their row
frequencies, than the Gold values. This is intriguing since
the traditional correlations of this family is fully Gold-like as
shown in [4]. It remains an open problem to obtain analytical
results for the triple autocorrelations of this family.

by repeated application of Parseval. This directly implies
λ∈ySr ∩zSr ∩Sr

where we deﬁne Sr = {λ : r(λ) = 0}. Following along the
ˆ
lines of the derivation in [7] we note that since

D. Bent Function Sequences
Bent function sequences were introduced by Olsen et al [7].
They form a relatively small family–the family size of 2n/2
where we assume n is even, is roughly the square root of the
period which is 2n − 1. They asymptotically approach known
lower bounds for sequence correlations, such as the Sidelnikov
bound.
The design philosophy of bent function sequences was
based on a frequency domain approach, and we shall consider
them in that setting.

λ∈Sr

from parseval since R(x) is ±1-valued, we conclude that
2

Br = max |ˆ(λ)| ≥
r
λ∈F2n

|ySr ∩ Ss | ≤ 1,
for spectral support sets Sr and Ss corresponding to two
distinct sequences s(t) and r(t) which are in the Bent function
family.
In our case, we want to bound a triple intersection in
size, but such an intersection is always a subset of a double
intersection as bounded by Olsen et al. Moreover, we were
only considering auto triple correlations, but it turns out we
can also consider cross triple correlations and get the same
result since all the spectral support sets in the bent function
family obey the inequality above and hence have to obey the
inequality
|ySr ∩ zSs ∩ Sp | ≤ 1,

via the identiﬁcation r(t) := r(αt ) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2n − 2 since
n
F∗n = {1, α, α2 , . . . , α2 −2 } holds.

From this it immediately follows that the correlation becomes
Cr (τ ) = −r(0)2 +
r(ατ x)r(x).

Deﬁnition 4. The trace transform r(λ) of r(x) is
ˆ

2n/2

r(x)(−1)T r(λx) .

It immediately follows that this transform has a lot of nice
properties, including being self-inverse,

which we require,for any 3 bent function sequences r(t), s(t)

Now, to consider triple autocorrelations, we focus only on
nontrivial shifts (both τ and δ nonzero), and observe that we
have, once we let y = ατ , z = αδ where neither y nor z are
in the subﬁeld F2 ,

IV. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have considered binary sequences with
ideal autocorrelation and binary sequence families with optimal correlation, and continued our investigation of their
triple correlation functions. This forms an interesting area of
further research, for example, we have no theoretical results on
the GMW triple correlations, even though some experimental
results were observed in [2]. Interestingly we have found that
bent function sequences have well bounded auto- and crosstriple correlations.

From here on, Olsen et al show that the classical correlation

do by showing that for their choice of the balanced functions,
