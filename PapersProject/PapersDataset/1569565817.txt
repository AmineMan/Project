the minimum distance. Single parity check and cyclic Reed–
Solomon codes are used as non-zero-locator codes and the
connection to the HT bound is shown in Section IV. Section V
concludes this contribution.

Abstract—A new approach to bound the minimum distance of
q-ary cyclic codes is presented. The connection to the BCH and
the Hartmann–Tzeng bound is formulated and it is shown that
for several cases an improvement is achieved.
We associate a second cyclic code to the original one and bound
its minimum distance in terms of parameters of the associated
code.

II. P RELIMINARIES
Let q be a power of a prime, let Fq denote the ﬁnite
ﬁeld of order q and let Fq [x] denote the set of all univariate
polynomials with coefﬁcients in Fq and indeterminate x. A
q-ary cyclic code C over Fq of length n, dimension k and
minimum distance d is denoted by C(q; n, k, d). A codeword
n−1
c(x) = i=0 ci xi of C(q; n, k, d) is a multiple of its generator
polynomial g(x) ∈ Fq [x] with roots in Fqs , where n | (q s −1).
Let α ∈ Fqs be a primitive nth root of unity. A cyclotomic
coset Mr is given by:

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cyclic codes play an important role in coding theory and
many communication systems. Their cyclic structure allows
among other things efﬁcient decoding methods. For many
cyclic codes, the minimum distance is not known, and hence
we will investigate the minimum Hamming distance of q-ary
cyclic codes in this contribution.
The Bose–Ray-Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH, [1], [2])
bound uses the longest consecutive sequence in the deﬁning
set of the code to bound the minimum distance. Its generalization, the Hartmann–Tzeng (HT, [3], [4]) bound, is based on
several consecutive sets of zeros. Further generalizations are
the contributions of Roos [5], [6], van Lint and Wilson [7],
Duursma and K¨ tter [8] and Duursma and Pellikaan [9]. Other
o
approaches include the Boston bounds [10] and the bound by
Betti and Sala [11].
Our approach uses a second cyclic code — the non-zerolocator code — to describe the deﬁning set of the cyclic code
which allows to bound its minimum distance. It turns out that
a good bound on the minimum distance is achieved, if the
non-zero-locator code has low rate and a small distance.
This contribution is a generalization of our previous
work [12], [13], where we used the power series expansion
of a fraction of two co-prime polynomials and associated it
with the code. The advantage of this extension is that we can
directly use well-known properties of cyclic codes to describe
another cyclic code rather than abstract properties of power
series expansions. Further, this contribution is a generalization
of [12], [13] since the non-zero-locator code can be seen as a
sum of several power series expansions.
Our contribution is structured as follows. We introduce
necessary preliminaries of q-ary cyclic codes in Section II
and recall the HT bound. Section III gives the deﬁnition of

Mr = {rq j mod n, ∀j = 0, 1, . . . , nr − 1},

(1)

nr

where nr is the smallest integer such that rq ≡ r mod n.
It is well-known that the minimal polynomial Mr (x) ∈ Fq [x]
of the element αr is given by
(x − αi ).

Mr (x) =

(2)

i∈Mr

The deﬁning set DC of a q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) is
the set containing the indices of the zeros of the generator
polynomial g(x) and can be partitioned into m cyclotomic
cosets:
def

DC = {i : g(αi ) = 0} = Mr1 ∪ Mr2 ∪ · · · ∪ Mrm .

(3)

Hence, the generator polynomial g(x) ∈ Fq [x] of degree n−k
of C(q; n, k, d) is
m

g(x) =

Mri (x).

Let us recall a well-known bound on the minimum distance
of cyclic codes.
Theorem 1 (Hartmann–Tzeng (HT) Bound, [3]) Let a qary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with the deﬁning set DC be
given. Suppose there exist the integers b1 , m1 and m2 with
gcd(n, m1 ) = 1 and gcd(n, m2 ) = 1 such that
{b1 + i1 m1 + i2 m2 | 0 ≤ i1 ≤ d0 − 2, 0 ≤ i2 ≤ ν} ⊆ DC .

This work has been supported by DFG, Germany, under grant BO 867/22-1.

Then, d ≥ d0 + ν.

Before we prove the main theorem on the minimum distance
of a cyclic code C, we describe Deﬁnition 2. We search the
“longest” sequence

Note that for ν = 0 the HT bound becomes the BCH
bound [1], [2]. A further generalization was proposed by
Roos [5], [6] and van Lint and Wilson [7]. Decoding up to
the HT and the Roos bound was formulated by Feng and
Tzeng [14, Section VI].
We consider cyclic Reed–Solomon (RS) codes [15] for
our approach and therefore recapitulate their deﬁnition in the
following.

c(αe )a(β 0 ), c(αe+1 )a(β 1 ), . . . , c(αe+µ−2 )a(β µ−2 ),
that results in a zero-sequence of length µ−1, i.e., the product
of the evaluated codeword a(β j ) of the non-zero-locator code
L and the evaluated codeword c(αj+e ) of C gives zero for all
j = 0, . . . , µ − 2.
We require a root β j of the non-zero-locator code L at the
position j where the cyclic code C has no zero.
We require gcd(n, n ) = 1 to guarantee that

Deﬁnition 1 (Cyclic Reed–Solomon Code) Let n be an integer dividing q − 1 and let α denote an element of multiplicative order n in Fq . Let δ be an integer. Furthermore, let the
generator polynomial gδ (x) ∈ Fq [x] be deﬁned as:

(1 − xαi β j ),

that we use for the degree calculation in the following. For the
proof we refer to [12, Lemma 1]. We rewrite the expression
of Deﬁnition 2 with (5) more explicitly. Let Z denote the set
of indexes of nonzero coefﬁcients of a(x) ∈ L.

Then, a cyclic Reed–Solomon code over Fq of length n | q − 1
and dimension k, denoted by RS(q; n, k; δ), is deﬁned by:
RS(q; n, k; δ) = {m(x)gδ (x) : deg m(x) < k}.

We extend our earlier approach [12], [13], where we associated a power series expansion of a fraction of two co-prime
polynomials with the zeros of a cyclic code. Now, we connect
another cyclic code — the so-called non-zero-locator code —
to a given cyclic code.
Let us establish a connection between the codewords of a
cyclic code and the sum of power series expansions. Let c(x)
be a codeword of a given q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) and
let the set Y denote the set of indices of nonzero coefﬁcients
of c(x)
c(x) =

where the degree of the denominator is exactly |Y| · |Z| due
to (6). The degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to
(|Y| − 1) · |Z| + |Z| − 1. In the following we assume that the
degree of the numerator is (|Y|−1)·|Z|+|Z|−1 = |Y|·|Z|−1.
This leads to the following theorem on the minimum
distance of a cyclic code C.

Deﬁnition 2 (Non-Zero-Locator Code) Let a q-ary cyclic
code C(q; n, k, d) be given. Let α denote an nth root of unity.
Let gcd(n, n ) = 1 and let β be an n th root of unity. Then,
L(q ; n , k , d ) is a non-zero-locator code of C if there exists a
µ ≥ 0 and an integer e, such that ∀ a(x) ∈ L and ∀ c(x) ∈ C:
∞

c(αj+e )a(β j )xj ≡ 0 mod xµ−1 ,

C(q; n, k, d) with the associated non-zero-locator code
L(q ; n , k , d ) and the integers µ and e be given with

Proof: For a codeword c(x) ∈ C(q; n, k, d) of weight d
and codeword a(x) ∈ L(q ; n , k , d ) of weight d , the degree
of the denominator in (2) is d · d . The numerator has degree
at most d · d − 1, and has to be greater than or equal to µ − 1.

maximized.
If we require a small cardinality of the deﬁning set DC , the
cardinality of the deﬁning set DL of the non-zero-locator code
should be large to obtain a long zero-sequence and therefore L
should have a low rate k /n . On the other hand, the distance
d of the non-zero-locator code L should be small.

A. Normalization of HT Bound

DC = {1, 2, 3, 4, , 6, 7, 8, 9, , 11, 12, , 14, 15, 16, , 18},

Let us rewrite the HT bound as given in Theorem 1. We
multiply with the inverse of m2 modulo n. Let C(q; n, k, d)
be a q-ary cyclic code with the deﬁning set DC . Let

i

where the symbol marks the index where g(α ) = 0.
We associate a single parity check code of length n = 5,
k = 4 distance d = 2 as non-zero-locator code for
C(2; 21, 7, 8) according to Deﬁnition 2. For e = 0 the subset
of the deﬁning set of C(2; 21, 7, 8) and L(24 ; 5, 4, 2) is listed in
Table I, where the product gives the a zero-sequence of length
13. The codewords a(x) ∈ L(24 ; 5, 4, 2) “ﬁll” the missing
zeros of C(2; 21, 7, 8) at position 0, 5 and 10 in the interval
[0, 12]. We have µ − 1 = 13 and therefore d∗ = (14)/2 = 7.
The HT bound with parameters b1 = 1, m1 = 5, d0 = 3
and m2 = 1, ν = 3 gives also a lower bound of 7 and the
Roos bound gives 8 [7], which is the minimum distance of
C(2; 21, 7, 8).

where gcd(n, m) = 1. Then d ≥ d0 + ν.
Note that m > ν + 1. We refer to this representation of
the HT bound in this section. In the following, we consider a
single parity check code as non-zero-locator code and outline
the connection to a particular case of the HT bound. The
general case is then considered in Subsection IV-C, where
cyclic RS codes are used as non-zero-locator codes.

Example 2 (Parity Code as Non-Zero-Locator Code)
Consider a cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with the deﬁning set DC
and let

We associate a binary single parity check code as non-zerolocator code. Let L(2; n , n − 1, 2) be the cyclic non-zerolocator code with generator polynomial g(x) = x − 1. We
assume gcd(n, n ) = 1 for the given cyclic code C(q; n, k, d).
We illustrate the set of zeros of the cyclic non-zero-locator
code L, i.e., a single parity check code, for the cyclic code
C(q; n, k, d) in Table III. A
represents the existence of a
non-zero of the corresponding code C or L. The sequence is
illustrated in terms of parameters of the HT bound as in (9).
The considered code C has d0 − 1 sets of ν + 1 consecutive
zeros, separated by one non-zero. The non-zero-locator code
ﬁlls exactly this one non-zero.

{−5, −4, , −2, −1, , 1, 2, , 4, 5, } ⊆ DC .
Furthermore let gcd(n, 3) = 1. We associate a cyclic single
parity check code of length n = 3 with C and illustrate the
corresponding zero-sequence in Table IV. The zero-sequence
has length µ − 1 = 13 and we obtain d∗ = (14)/2 = 7.
The HT bound gives for b2 = −5, m = 3 and d0 = 5, ν = 1

code. Now we consider the case were m > ν +2 and associate
a RS code to the given q-ary cyclic code.
Let a q-ary cyclic code C(q; n, k, d) with a subset of its

V. C ONCLUSION AND O UTLOOK
We presented and proved a new bound on the minimum
distance of q-ary cyclic codes. The used technique is based on
a second cyclic code — the so-called non-zero-locator code.
We used non-zero-locator codes that allow us to connect the
Hartmann–Tzeng bound directly with our bound. In detail, we
used single parity check codes and RS codes and showed for
which parameters our bound improves upon the HT bound.
Future work is the decoding up to our bound and the
classiﬁcation of cyclic codes, where the non-zero-locator code
gives a good bound on the minimum distance.

d = m − ν.

The m − ν − 1 consecutive zeros of the non-zero-locator code
L, i.e., a cyclic RS code of length m, ﬁll the missing zeros of
the given cyclic code C(q; n, k, d). We obtain for the “zero”sequence with length µ = m(d0 − 1) + m − ν − 1.
Therefore, we obtain from (8):

Note that for m = ν + 2 the non-zero-locator code is a single
parity check code and we obtain the result from (10). Fig. 2
shows d∗ of (11) normalized to d0 + ν for the same parameter
ν = 6. We varied the distance d of the non-zero-locator code.
Let us precise the cases where our bound d∗ is larger than
the Hartmann–Tzeng bound d0 + ν.

deﬁning set with parameters d0 , ν, m1 = m and m2 = 1 as
stated in Theorem 1 be given. Let L(q ; m, ν + 1, m − ν) be
the associated cyclic RS code as in Deﬁnition 2. Then, for
d0 > m − ν + 1,
d∗ > d0 + ν holds.
Proof: From (11) we have
d∗ =

md0 − ν
m−ν
=

md0 − d0 ν + d0 ν − ν
m−ν
= d0 +

(d0 − 1)ν
.
m−ν

For d∗ > d0 + ν, we need
(d0 − 1)ν
>ν
m−ν
d0 > m − ν + 1 = d + 1

(12)

For m − ν = d = 2 the associated RS code is a single parity
check code and our bound is better than the HT bound for
d0 > 3 (see Fig. 1). Some other cases, where the distance of
the associated RS code m − ν = d is between two and six,
are illustrated in Fig. 2.
