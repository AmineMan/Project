error estimation of vector ﬁelds, as might be measured in
a sensor network. In such networks, the parameter d is the
dimension of the ﬁeld being measured, L is the number of
sensors and N can be taken as the approximate bandwidth of
the measured signal per dimension. This asymptotic can be
calculated as a random eigenvalue expectation, whose limit
distribution depends on the signal dimension d. In the case
d = 1 the limit is via random Vandermonde matrices. As
d → ∞ the Marchenko–Pastur limit distribution is shown
to apply. Further applications were treated in [3], including
source identiﬁcation and wavelength estimation.

Abstract—In this work we examine the behavior of the minimum
singular value of random Vandermonde matrices. In particular,
we prove that the minimum singular value s1 (N ) is at most
√
N exp(−C N ) where N is the dimension of the matrix and
C is a constant. Furthermore, the value of the constant C is
determined explicitly. The main result is obtained in two different
ways. One approach uses techniques from stochastic processes
and in particular, a construction related to the Brownian bridge.
The other one is a more direct analytical approach involving
combinatorics and complex analysis. As a consequence, we obtain
a lower bound on the maximum absolute value of a random
polynomial on the unit circle, which may be of independent
mathematical interest.

One is typically interested in studying the behavior of these
matrices as both N and L go to inﬁnity at a given ratio,
L
limN →∞ N = β. In [3] important results were obtained for
the case d = 1. In particular, the limit of the moments of
V∗ V was derived and a combinatorial formula for the asymptotic moments was given under the hypothesis of continuous
density. In [1] these results were extended to more general
densities and it was also proved that these moments arise
as the moments of a probability measure µν,β supported on
[0, ∞). This measure depends of course on the measure ν, the
distribution of the phases, and on the value of β. In [1] the
behavior of the maximum singular value was studied and tight
upper and lower bounds for the maximum eigenvalue of V∗ V
were obtained. Moreover, in [2], these results were extended
to d-fold generalized Vandermonde matrix.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this paper we study several aspects of random Vandermonde
matrices with unit magnitude complex entries and their generalizations. An N × L matrix V with unit complex entries is
a Vandermonde matrix if there exist values θ1 , . . . , θL ∈ [0, 1]
such that

e2πi(N −1)θ1 . . . e2πi(N −1)θL
(see [3] or [1] for more details). A random Vandermonde
matrix is produced if the entries of the phase vector θ :=
(θ1 , . . . , θL ) ∈ [0, 1]L are random variables. For the purposes
of this paper it will be assumed that the phase vector has i.i.d.
components, with distribution drawn according to a measure
ν that has a density f (x) on [0, 1].

A natural question is to examine the behavior of the smallest
singular value as N → ∞, and this paper is one of the ﬁrst
to address this question. Here we restrict to the case d = 1.
The matrix V∗ V is an L × L positive deﬁnite random matrix
with eigenvalues

Random Vandermonde matrices and their generalized versions,
also called d-fold Vandermonde matrices, are a natural construction with a wide range of applications in ﬁelds as diverse
as ﬁnance [9], signal processing [4], wireless communications
[6], statistical analysis [5], security [7] and biology [11]. This
stems from the close relationship that unit magnitude complex
Vandermonde matrices have with the discrete Fourier transform. Among these, there is an important recent application for
signal reconstruction using noisy samples (see [4]) where an
asymptotic estimate is obtained for the mean–square error. In
particular, and as was shown in [4], generalized Vandermonde
matrices play an important role in the minimum mean–square

0 ≤ λ1 (N ) ≤ . . . ≤ λL (N ).
The singular values of V are by deﬁnition the eigenvalues of
√
V∗ V. Therefore, si (N ) = λi (N ). On one hand, it is clear
that if L > N then the matrix V∗ V is of size L × L and rank
N . Therefore, if β > 1 the asymptotic limit measure has an
atom at zero of size at least β −1 and in particular λ1 (N ) = 0.
On the other hand, if L = N , then with probability 1 the

In [1] the class of functions for which the limit eigenvalue
distribution exists was enlarged to include unbounded densities, and lower bounds and upper bounds for the maximum
eigenvalue were found. We suggest that the interested reader
look at [3] and [1] for more properties on the Vandermonde
expansion coefﬁcients Kρ,ν , as well as methods and formulas
to compute them.

where, as before, the phases {θ1 , . . . , θN } are i.i.d on [0, 1].
Moreover, we explicitly determine the constant C. We believe
that this may prove to be of independent mathematical interest. Additionally, we show that the moments for the matrix
(V∗ V)−1 are not ﬁnite.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section II, we set
up some notation and terminology and present some known
results for random Vandermonde matrices. In Section III, we
prove the absence of ﬁnite moments for the matrix M∗ M
where M = V−1 . In Section IV, we study the behavior of
the minimum singular value of V. Finally, in Section V we
present some numerical results.

This determinant is zero if and only if there exist distinct p
and q such that θp = θq . This is an event of zero probability
if the probability measure has a density. Therefore, the minimum singular value s1 (N ) is positive with probability 1 and
converges to zero as N increases. In this work, we show that

IV. M INIMUM E IGENVALUE
We are now in a position to prove the following Lemma, which
provides upper and lower bounds on the minimum singular
value of a Vandermonde matrix, in terms of the polynomial
Tp , deﬁned in (10).

In this Section we focus on the behavior of the minimum eigenvalue λ1 . Given a square N × N complex matrix M, we have the following matrix norms ||M||1 :=

λN (M∗ M). The

In the following steps we ﬁnd a bound on λ1 (N ) in terms of
the maximum of a polynomial with roots on the unit circle.
We begin with some deﬁnitions. Let zk = e2πiθk be the values
determining the random Vandermonde matrix as in equation
(1). Let P (z) be the polynomial deﬁned as

βp :=

(12)

Moreover,

The second inequality follows immediately from the triangle
inequality and the ﬁrst one follows by applying the Cauchy’s
integral Theorem and using the fact that |z|=1 z −i dz = 0 for
all i = 1.

P (z) :=

≤ λ1 (N ),

q=p0

Therefore, using the fact that
(9)

max max |Tp (z)| ≥ max |Tp0 (z)|,

|z|=1

|z|=1

Proof: Consider the function Ψ(z) = log |P (z)| +
log |P (−z)|. This function is continuous except at the values
{z1 , −z1 , . . . , zN , −zN } where it has a vertical asymptote
going to −∞. Therefore, we can consider this function
as a continuous function from the unit circle to [−∞, ∞)
with the usual topology. On the other hand, it is clear that
Ψ(z) = 0. Therefore, there exist w such that Ψ(w) = 0
|z|=1
and hence |P (w)||P (−w)| = 1.

A. Brownian Bridge Construction
This argument was previously showed in [2]. Before stating
our upper bound for the minimum eigenvalue, we introduce
the following deﬁnitions. First, we deﬁne a random sequence
via a realization of the Brownian bridge W o on [0, 2π], which
satisﬁes W o (0) = W o (2π) = 0. A shift phase ϕ of the bridge
is deﬁned by

Consider the following construction. We randomly choose
the points {zi }N and consider the set of pairs P :=
i=1
{(z1 , −z1 ), . . . , (zN , −zN )}. Note that changing zi to −zi
does not affect the value of the point w in the previous Lemma.
Hence the set P determines the point w. Now we ﬁx this
point and consider αi := |w − zi | and βi := |w + zi |. Since
N
|P (w)P (−w)| = 1 we see that i=1 αi βi = 1. It is also clear
2
that βi = 4 − αi .

o
Wϕ (θ) := W o (ϕ + θ) − W o (ϕ),

if 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π − ϕ and

Let y be the random variable deﬁned as y : {1, −1}N → R
with

o
Wϕ (θ) := W o (ϕ + θ − 2π) − W o (ϕ),

if 2π − ϕ ≤ θ < 2π. Given a realization of the Brownian
bridge and ϕ ∈ [0, 2π] we deﬁne the following function,

y(v1 , v2 , . . . , vN ) =

I(ϕ) :=

taking signs i.i.d. at random with probability 1/2. It is not
difﬁcult to see that E(y) = 0 where the average is taken over
the set {1, −1}N . Note that

(19)

Note that it is not clear that the above integral is well deﬁned,
sin θ
since it may not exist as the fraction 1−cos θ behaves like
−1
θ
near 0 and 2π. However, this is the case almost surely.
Furthermore, it can be shown that I(ϕ) is continuous on
the interval [0, 1]. Therefore, there exists a value ϕ∗ which
determines the maximum value of I(ϕ), which we denote as
I ∗ . More precisely,
I ∗ := sup {I(ϕ) : ϕ ∈ [0, 2π]} .

and w is as in Lemma 4. Since |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (−w)| =
|P(v1 ,...,vN ) (w)|−1 , we see that

We are now in a position to state our main result for an upper
bound on λ1 (N ).

y(v1 , . . . , vN ) = log |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (w)|2 .

Theorem 3. Assume that the phases θ1 , . . . , θN are i.i.d. and
drawn accordingly to the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Then

The proof of this fact uses elegant techniques from additive
combinatorics as the Littlewood–Offord theory which have to
be omitted for space purposes. The next Theorem presents
a lower bound for the maximum magnitude of the random
polynomial P (z).

B. Analytical and Combinatorial Construction
In this Section, we present an analytical and elementary
argument for the upper bound on the minimum eigenvalue.
Let z1 , z2 , . . . , zN be complex numbers in the unit circle and
N
let P (z) = i=1 (z − zi ) be the polynomial with these roots.
We want to estimate max|z|=1 |P (z)| when the roots {zi }N
i=1
are i.i.d uniformly distributed random variables on the unit
circle.

> 0 we have that
√ √
P max |P (z)|2 ≥ exp(γ π N /2) ≥ 1 − ,

Theorem 5. Given
|z|=1

(24)

for N sufﬁciently large.

Lemma 4. Given P (z) as before, there exists |w| = 1 such
that |P (w)P (−w)| = 1.

Proof: As we mentioned before we start by randomly generating N pairs of diametrically opposite points (zi , −zi ), and

4

then ﬁnd w as in Lemma 4. We ﬁnally ﬁx the zi by N independent coin ﬂips (v1 , . . . , vN ) and condition on this event. We
observed before that |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (−w)| = |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (w)|−1 .
Hence,
log |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (w)| = − log |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (−w)|.
Let a(w) be
=

log |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (w)| − log |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (−w)|

=

a(w)

log |P(v1 ,...,vN ) (w)|2 .

Then by the previous Theorem and equation (23) we see that
√ √
P |a(w)| ≥ γ π N /2 ≥ 1 − .
Since a(−w) = −a(w) we clearly see that
√ √
P max a(w), a(−w) ≥ γ π N /2 ≥ 1 − .
