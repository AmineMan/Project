Abstract—We propose a buffer-aided relaying protocol for a
three node relay network comprised of a source, a half-duplex
relay with buffer, and a destination. We assume a direct sourcedestination link is available and all links undergo fading. The
proposed protocol enables the half-duplex relay to choose its
reception and transmission time slots adaptively and based on
the quality of the involved links. We derive the achievable ergodic
rate of the considered three-node network for the proposed
protocol. Our results show that this achievable ergodic rate
exceeds existing unachievable ergodic capacity upper bounds for
the three-node half-duplex relay channel with the relay always
alternating between reception and transmission in successive time
slots.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The capacity of the memoryless relay channel comprised of
a source, a full-duplex relay, and a destination was investigated
in [1], [2]. Later, [3] extended the results in [2] to the case
of the half-duplex relay channel with fading and introduced
achievable ergodic rates and unachievable ergodic capacity upper bounds. The results in [3] are based on the assumption that
a decode-and-forward half-duplex relay receives a codeword in
one time slot and retransmits information about that codeword
to the destination in the following time slot. Therefore, the
relay node cannot adapt its reception and transmission time
slots based on the channel qualities and is forced to alternate
between reception and transmission in successive time slots.
However, recently the authors in [4] showed that a relay with
a buffer can adapt its reception and transmission time slots
based on the quality of the source-relay and relay-destination
channels. In this paper, we extend the work in [4] to the
case when a direct source-destination link exists. Hence, we
develop a protocol in which in every time slot a decision is
made on whether to use the relay or not. Furthermore, if the
relay is used, then a decision is made on whether the relay
should transmit or receive. These decisions are made based
on the quality of the involved links in each time slot. Our
numerical results reveal that the proposed protocol produces
an achievable ergodic rate, which for low and moderate signalto-noise ratios (SNRs), is larger than the unachievable upper
bound on the ergodic capacity introduced in [3] for the
case when the relay always alternates between reception and
transmission in successive time slots.
Relays with buffers where the relay’s transmission and
reception time slots are not a priori ﬁxed were also considered
in [5]-[7]. However, the protocols in [5]-[7] are heuristic and
were designed without taking into consideration their impact
on the throughput. Consequently, these schemes do not fully
exploit the extra degrees of freedom offered by relays with
buffers.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, the considered system model is presented. In
Section III, the buffer-aided relaying protocol is introduced,
and in Section IV this protocol is optimized for throughput

maximization. In Section V, numerical results are provided,
and some conclusions are drawn in Section VI.
II. S YSTEM AND C HANNEL M ODELS
We consider a three-node communication system comprising a source S, a half-duplex relay R, and a destination D.
The relay is equipped with a buffer of unlimited size. The
source sends messages to the destination directly or with the
help of the half-duplex relay, which decodes these messages,
possibly stores some information about the message in its
buffer, and eventually sends this information to the destination.
We assume that time is divided into slots of equal lengths and
that every message sent by the source and relay is encoded by
a capacity approaching code with codewords comprised of n
symbols, where n → ∞. The instantaneous link SNRs of the
S-D, S-R, and R-D channels in the ith time slot are denoted
by x(i), y(i), and z(i), respectively. We assume that the link
SNRs are constant during one time slot but change from one
time slot to the next due to e.g. the mobility of the involved
nodes and/or frequency hopping. The instantaneous SNRs
x(i), y(i), and z(i) are modeled as mutually independent,
non-negative, and ergodic random processes with expected
values ΩX = E{x(i)}, ΩY = E{y(i)}, and ΩZ = E{z(i)},
respectively, where E{·} denotes expectation. The instantaneous link SNRs x(i), y(i), and z(i) can be decomposed
as x(i) = γS x(i), y(i) = γS y (i), and z = γR z (i), where
¯

γS = PS /σn and γR = PR /σn denote the transmit SNRs,
with PS and PR representing the transmit powers of the source

and the relay, respectively, and σn representing the variance of
the additive white Gaussian noise at both relay and destination.
x(i), y (i), and z (i) are the instantaneous channel gains of

ΩX = γS ΩX , ΩY = γS ΩY , and ΩZ = γR ΩZ .
Throughout this paper, we assume that the codewords transmitted by the source and relay nodes have constant powers PS
and PR in every time slot i. Furthermore, we assume that the
source node has always data to transmit, and therefore the
number of time slots N satisﬁes N → ∞.
III. B UFFER -A IDED R ELAYING P ROTOCOL
In this section, we introduce the buffer-aided relaying protocol with adaptive link selection for the considered system. In
the following, we assume that all three nodes have knowledge
2
of PS , PR , and σn .
A. Modelling of the Decision Process
In a given time slot i, all three nodes acquire knowledge of
x(i), y(i), and z(i). Based on this knowledge, the three nodes
make one of the following decisions:
• whether or not to use the relay,
• if the relay is used, whether the relay should receive or
transmit, that is, whether to select the S-R or R-D link
for transmission.

To model the decisions made in every time slot i, we introduce two binary decision variables, referred to as the relay
selection variable ri ∈ {0, 1}, and the link selection variable
di ∈ {0, 1}. For the relay selection variable ri , in the i-th
time slot, we set ri = 0 if the relay is not utilized, i.e., if the
source transmits directly to the destination without the relay’s
help, and we set ri = 1 if the relay is utilized, i.e., the source
transmits to the destination with the help of the relay. For the
link selection variable di , in the ith time slot, we set di = 0 if
the source transmits and the relay receives, i.e., the S-R link
is selected for transmission, and we set di = 1 if the relay
transmits and the destination receives, i.e., the R-D link is
selected for transmission.
B. Transmission Rates, Queue States, and Decoding Process
Relay is not utilized (ri = 0): In this case, the only available
link is the S-D link with instantaneous SNR x(i), and thus
the source transmits to the destination directly. In this time
slot, the source’s codebook is comprised of 2nX(i) codewords,
where X(i) is the capacity in bits/symbol of the S-D link at
time slot i, given by
X(i) = log2 1 + x(i) .
(1)
Relay is utilized (ri = 1) and the source is selected for
transmission (di = 0): In this case, the source has two
available channels for transmission, the S-D and the S-R
channel. Let Y (i) denote the capacity of the S-R channel
in time slot i, given by
Y (i) = log2 1 + y(i) .

(2)

Then, if Y (i) < X(i) the source can broadcast a codeword
with X(i) bits/symbol which will be successfully decoded at
the destination and unsuccessfully at the relay. Thus, when
Y (i) < X(i) the relay is useless. The relay can be useful only
when Y (i) > X(i) in which case the source can broadcast a
codeword with Y (i) bits/symbol, which will be successfully
decoded at the relay and unsuccessfully at the destination. To
conclude, when ri = 1 and di = 0, the source’s codebook
is comprised of 2nY (i) codewords and the source transmit a
codeword with Y (i) bits/symbol which only the relay is able
to decode.
The relay uses superposition coding described in [8,
Sec.15.1.4]. Hence, the source’s codebook is partitioned into
2n(Y (i)−X(i)) uniform disjoint partitions, each partition comprised of 2nX(i) codewords, and each partition mapped to
an index number J ∈ 1, ..., 2n(Y (i)−X(i)) . The partitioning
and mapping of the source’s codebook is known at all three
nodes. When the relay receives a codeword, it decodes it and
checks in which partition the received codeword lies, then it
stores the complete information about the index number of that
partition in its buffer. In this way, for each received codeword
comprised of nY (i) bits of information, the relay stores only
n(Y (i) − X(i)) bits of information. Then, the amount of
normalized information in bits/symbol in the buffer at the end
of time slot i when ri = 1 and di = 0 is given by
Q(i) = Q(i − 1) + Y (i) − X(i) ,
(3)
which is always nonnegative since Y (i) > X(i).
Relay is utilized (ri = 1) and the relay is selected for
transmission (di = 1): When the relay is selected for
transmission, it extracts nWQ (i) bits of information from the

2

buffer, maps them to a codeword and transmits the codeword
to the destination through the R-D channel with capacity
Z(i) = log2 (1 + z(i)). In the following, we normalize the
amount of information in bits that is extracted from the relay’s
buffer nWQ (i) by the number of symbols n. Therefore, WQ (i)
is the normalized amount of information in bits/symbol that
is extracted from the relay’s buffer and is transmitted to the
destination. WQ (i) is limited by two upper bounds. The ﬁrst
bound is due to the total amount of normalized information
in bits/symbol that the relay has stored in its buffer, which is
given by Q(i − 1). The second bound is the maximum rate
in bits/symbol at which the destination can decode assuming
that source and relay cooperate and perform beamforming.
This bound is given by
W (i) = log2 1 +

x(i) +

z(i)

2

.

(4)

Therefore, WQ (i) is given by
WQ (i) = min {Q(i − 1) , W (i)} .

(5)

The codebook that source and relay use has 2nWQ (i) codewords each with n symbols. We note that for source and relay
to be able to perform beamforming in time slot i, the source
has to track all past and current instantaneous SNRs x(k),
y(k), and z(k), for k = 1, ..., i, in order to know the exact
information bits that the relay transmits in time slot i.
At the end of the considered time slot i, the amount of
normalized bits/symbol in the buffer is given by
Q(i) = Q(i − 1) − WQ (i)

(6)

which is always nonnegative due to (5).
Decoding at the Destination: There are three possible cases:
1) If at time slot i the source sends a codeword directly
to the destination without utilizing the relay (ri = 0), then
the destination can successfully decode the codeword sent at
a rate of X(i) bits/symbol.
2) If at time slot i the relay is utilized and the source
transmits (r1 = 1, di = 0), then the destination cannot decode
the codeword sent at a rate of Y (i) bits/symbol. Therefore, it
stores the received codeword and waits until some future time
slot in which the relay reveals to the destination the partition
number in which the stored codeword lies.
3) If at time slot i the relay is utilized and the source and
relay transmit a codeword via beamforming (ri = di = 1),
then the destination can successfully decode the codeword
sent at a rate of WQ (i) bits/symbol. The information that
this codeword carries is comprised of the partition indices
in which some stored codewords lie, and this information
helps the destination to decode these previously undecodable
codewords. To this end, the destination has to divide the
nWQ (i) bits of information into groups of bits carrying
information about the partition numbers of different stored
codewords. Without loss of generality assume that nWQ (i)
carries information about the partition indices of L stored
codewords, for L ∈ {1, 2, ..., N }. Let these codewords be
placed in a ordered set denoted by C, in which the codewords
are sorted by the time slot in which they were received
and stored at the destination, starting with the ﬁrst received
codeword. Hence, set C can be written as C = {c1 , c2 , ..., cL },
where ck , k ∈ {1, 2, ..., L}, denotes the k-th codeword in
the set. Using set C we can distinguish three cases for the

information that nWQ (i) can carry: Case 1) nWQ (i) carries
the complete information about the partition numbers of the
codewords {c1 , c2 , ..., cL }, in which case the destination can
decode all these L stored codewords; Case 2) nWQ (i) carries
the complete information about the partition numbers of the
codewords {c1 , c2 , ..., cL−1 }, and partial information about
the partition number of the codeword cL , in which case the
destination can decode the codewords {c1 , c2 , ..., cL−1 }, but
it has to wait for the remainder of the information about the
partition number of the codeword cL in order to be able to
decode it; Case 3) nWQ (i) carries the complete information
about the partition numbers of the codewords {c2 , ..., cL−1 },
and partial information about the partition number of the
codewords c1 and cL , in which case the destination can decode
the codewords {c1 , c2 , ..., cL−1 }, but it has to wait for the
remainder of the information about the partition number of
the codeword cL in order to be able to decode it. Note
that although the information that nWQ (i) carries about c1
is partial, the destination has already received the remaining
information about the partition index of c1 in some previous
time slot(s). We note that for the destination to be able to
separate the information nWQ (i) into groups of information
about the partition numbers of different stored codewords, it
has to track all past and current instantaneous SNRs x(k),
y(k), and z(k), for k = 1, ..., i, in order to know the exact
amount of information stored in the buffer.
We now describe how a stored codeword, denoted by c, can
ˆ
be decoded. In the following, we assume a decoder based on
joint typicality [8]. Assume that the codeword c was sent by
the source at time slot k, and that the destination received
a noisy version of the codeword denoted by c, through the
ˆ
S-D channel. Furthermore, at time slot i assume that the
destination received from the relay the complete information
about the partition, whose number is denoted by J, in which
the transmitted codeword c lies. Then, the destination starts
the decoding process of c by computing the joint typicality
ˆ
between the received codeword c and only those codewords
ˆ
in the codebook that lie in the revealed partition with partition
number J. Note that this partition is comprised of 2nX(k)
codewords. Furthermore, note that the stored codeword c was
ˆ
received through a channel with capacity X(k). Therefore, the
event that the stored codeword c will be jointly typical with
ˆ
one and only one codeword from the partition with partition
number J, and that that codeword will be the codeword c
transmitted by the source, has probability P → 1 when
n → ∞ [8]. Therefore, the decoding of c will be successful.
ˆ
We ﬁrst derive the throughput of the considered system
and then maximize it by choosing the optimal di and ri . In
order to derive the throughput, we introduce two parameters
from queueing theory. Let A denote the average arrival rate in
bits/symbol/slot into the queue of the buffer and let D denote
the average departure rate in bits/symbol/slot out of the queue
of the buffer, given by

Proof: Please refer to Appendix A.
Our goal now is to maximize the throughput. To this end, we
ﬁrst introduce the edge of stability point, which is the point
where the queue is at the boundary between being a nonabsorbing and an absorbing queue, and yet the queue is nonabsorbing. This point can be rigorously deﬁned as follows:
Let I10 denote a set comprised of the slots in which ri = 1
and di = 0, let ǫ contain arbitrary slots that are not in I10 ,
and let A = D hold. The queue is at the edge of stability if
adding the slots in ǫ to I10 would make the queue absorbing,
i.e., A > D holds, even for |ǫ|/N → 0 when N → ∞, where
| · | denotes cardinality.
Theorem 2: The maximum throughput is obtained when the
queue in the buffer at the relay is at the edge of stability. In
this case the following identity holds for N → ∞

where W (i) is deﬁned in (4). A queue is said to be absorbing if
A > D, in which case a fraction of the bits sent by the source
get absorbed in the buffer and can never be extracted from it.
If a queue is non-absorbing, then by the law of conservation
of ﬂow A = D holds. Therefore, a necessary condition for all
bits transmitted by the source to be decoded at the destination,
is for the queue in the buffer at the relay to be non-absorbing,
i.e., A = D has to hold.

Proof: Due to lack of space we only present a sketch of
the proof in Appendix B. For the full proof, please refer to
[9].
Note that the throughput in (12) is now independent of the
queue state. This is because when the relay is selected to
transmit, the number of bits in the buffer practically always
exceeds the number of bits that can be transmitted over the
R-D channel. The event that the relay is selected to transmit
when its buffer is empty has negligible effect on the throughput
for N → ∞.
According to Theorem 2, the policy that maximizes the
throughput can only be found inside the set of policies that
produce a queue which is at the edge of stability, and not

outside this set. Therefore, using the necessary condition given
by (11), we construct the following maximization problem for

We note that this unachievable upper bound is obtained assuming that when the source transmits, the relay and destination
operate as a single node with two antennas. Furthermore,
this bound is optimized over three parameters, the slot length
dedicated to relay listening denoted by t, the fraction of power
dedicated to the source denoted by k, and the fraction of new
information that the source transmits when the relay is in the
transmit mode, denoted by ξ.

VI. C ONCLUSION
We have found an achievable ergodic rate for the wireless
three node half-duplex relay channel with a buffer at the
relay and a source-destination link. This rate exceeds existing
unachievable capacity upper bounds for the case when the
relay always alternates between reception and transmission in
successive time slots. This rate is achieved by a buffer-aided
relaying protocol in which the relay’s reception and transmission time slots are adapted according to the instantaneous
channel strengths.
A PPENDIX
A. Proof of Theorem 1
The total number of transmitted bits is the sum of the bits
sent directly to the destination when the relay is not active and
the bits transmitted when the relay is active and the source
is selected for transmission. Since all bits transmitted by the
source eventually arrive at the destination, the total number
of received bits is identical to the total number of transmitted
bits, leading to (9). Since A = D holds, from (7) and (8), the
following identity can be derived

the S-R and R-D channels capacities, the gain of buffer-aided
relaying over conventional relaying also vanishes. Note that in
Fig. 1, we only compare the achievable ergodic rate of bufferaided relaying to the unachievable ergodic capacity bound
of conventional relaying. However if we compare it to the
achievable ergodic rate of conventional relaying for Γ → ∞,
then the two rates will become identical. This comparison is
omitted here due to lack of space.

Introducing (22) in (9) leads to (10). This concludes the proof.
B. Proof of Theorem 2
At the edge of stability, the number of bits in the buffer
practically always exceeds the number of bits that can be
transmitted over the the R-D channel. Then, the event that

To prove that τ0 cannot be improved, we construct all other
possible policies which dislocate the queue from the edge of
stability and compare the achieved throughput to τ0 . These
policies make the events in which Q(i − 1) < W (i) nonnegligible in the throughput equation, i.e., (23) does not hold.
The only way for a policy to dislocate the queue from the
edge of stability and yet keep the buffer non-absorbing is to
increase the number of slots in I11 . Thus, lets pick arbitrary
slots that are not in the set I11 and put them in the set ǫ. Then
let I11 ∪ ǫ denote a set in which the slots in ǫ are added to
the slots in I11 . Note that N = |I0 | + |I10 | + |I11 |. Thus,
if the slots in ǫ are added to I11 then these slots must be
excluded from either the set I0 , or I10 , or from both I0 and
I10 . Therefore, there exist only three groups of other possible
policies.
The remainder of the proof is to derive the throughputs
for each of the three groups of possible policies, and then
compare these throughputs to τ0 . What we see then is that
none of the other policies can outperform the policy that
produces τ0 . However, due to lack of space this is omitted
here. For remainder of the proof please refer to [9].
