Unfortunately, constructing an MWBE codebook in an analytic
way is known to be extremely difﬁcult [2]. Due to the difﬁculty
of constructing optimal codebooks, numerous attempts have
been made to present a near-optimal codebook C where
Imax (C) is slightly higher than the Welch bound equality, but
asymptotically achieves the equality for sufﬁciently large N .
A number of construction examples based on codes and signal
sets can be found in [2]. Ding and Feng [4][5] also presented
several near-optimal codebooks from almost difference sets.
Generalizing this idea, Zhang and Feng [6][7] further constructed near-optimal codebooks with almost difference sets
and cyclotomic classes.
This paper discusses a framework for constructing an
(N, K) codebook C with K < N , where each code vector
is equivalent to a column of a K × N partial matrix. In the
framework, we form the K × N matrix by selecting K rows
from a J × N matrix Φ associated with a binary sequence
a of length J and Hamming weight K, where a set of the
selected row indices is equivalent to the index set of nonzero
entries or the support of a. Throughout this paper, we denote
the codebook as CΦ (a). It is then found that Imax (CΦ (a)) is
determined by the maximum magnitude of Φ-transform of the
binary sequence a. Thus, constructing a codebook CΦ (a) with
small Imax (CΦ (a)) is equivalent to ﬁnding a binary sequence
a where the maximum magnitude of its Φ-transform is as
small as possible. In particular, if the support of the binary
sequence forms a difference set, the framework can present
an optimal codebook equivalent to the one constructed by Xia
et al. [8], or Ding and Feng [9]. Also, if its support forms
an almost difference set, the codebook may be equivalent
to the one in [4] or [5]. However, we would like to stress
that our framework may further present a new codebook with
nontrivially bounded Imax (CΦ (a)), even if the support of the
associated sequence a does not form a difference (or almost
difference) set. In addition, it presents an efﬁcient technique
to develop an upper bound on Imax (CΦ (a)) through the Φtransform of an arbitrary binary sequence a.
For speciﬁc constructions, we present new near-optimal
partial Fourier and Hadamard codebooks associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences [10][11]. First of all, employing
the N × N inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) matrix
Φ = F, we construct an (N, K) near-optimal partial Fourier

Abstract—In this paper, an (N, K) codebook is constructed
from a K × N partial matrix with K < N , where each code
vector is equivalent to a column of the matrix. To obtain the
K × N matrix, K rows are selected from a J × N matrix Φ,
associated with a binary sequence of length J and Hamming
weight K, where a set of the selected row indices is the index set
of nonzero entries of the binary sequence. It is then discovered
that the maximum magnitude of inner products between a pair of
distinct code vectors is determined by the maximum magnitude
of Φ-transform of the binary sequence. Thus, constructing a
codebook with small magnitude of inner products is equivalent
to ﬁnding a binary sequence where the maximum magnitude
of its Φ-transform is as small as possible. From the discovery,
new classes of near-optimal codebooks with nontrivial bounds on
the maximum inner products are constructed from Fourier and
Hadamard matrices associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences.
Index Terms—Codebooks, Fourier matrices, Hadamard matrices, Sidelnikov sequences, Welch bound.

I. I NTRODUCTION
An (N, K) codebook C = {c0 , · · · , cN −1 } is a set of N
distinct code vectors in a K-dimensional vector space. Each
code vector cl = (cl,0 , · · · , cl,K−1 )T , 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1, has
K−1

2
unit-norm, i.e., ||cl || =
i=0 |cl,i | = 1, where T denotes
the transpose. For the applications, we need a codebook C
minimizing Imax (C) or the maximum magnitude of inner
products between a pair of distinct code vectors. To evaluate
an (N, K) codebook C, it is important to ﬁnd the minimum
achievable Imax (C) or its lower bound. The Welch bound [1]
provides

Imax (C) =

max

0≤l=m≤N −1

cH cm ≥

N −K
K(N − 1)

with equality if and only if for all pairs of (l, m) with
N −K
H
l = m, cH cm =
l
K(N −1) , where cl is the conjugate
transpose of cl . In particular, if Imax (C) meets the equality of
the Welch bound, then C is called a maximum-Welch-boundequality (MWBE) codebook [2].
The MWBE codebook, also known as an equiangular tight
frame [3], has been of interest in a variety of research areas.
This work was supported by the National Sciences and Engineering
Research Council (NSERC) of Canada.

Through the N -point IDFT of binary Sidelnikov sequences,
it is easily proven that Imax (CF (a)) is nontrivially bounded

Welch bound equality.

This section describes a framework of a codebook CΦ (a)
constructed from a matrix Φ associated with a binary sequence
a. The framework employs a J × N matrix Φ with entries of
φi,l for 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1 and 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1, which has the
following properties.
1) Property 1: Each entry of Φ has unit magnitude, i.e.,
|φi,l | = 1.
2) Property 2: No pair of column vectors in Φ is identical.
Moreover, the columns of Φ form a group under pointwise multiplication. In other words, for all l1 , l2 ∈ ZN ,
there exists an l ∈ ZN such that

A. Characteristic sequence and its support
Let D = {d0 , · · · , dK−1 } be a set of K distinct integers,
where dk ∈ ZN , 0 ≤ k ≤ K − 1. The characteristic sequence
of D is then deﬁned as a binary sequence a = (a0 , · · · , aN −1 )
where

if i ∈ D,
ai =
0,
if i ∈ D
for 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1. The set D is called the support of a.
The Hamming weight or the number of nonzero entries of a
is denoted as wt(a) = |D| = K.
B. Additive and multiplicative characters

For a prime p and a positive integer m, let N = pm − 1 and
α be a primitive element in Fpm . For some l, 1 ≤ l ≤ N − 1,
a multiplicative character [12] of Fpm can be deﬁned as

3) Property 3: From Property 2, Φ has a column with all
one entries if l1 = l2 . Without loss of generality, we
assume that it is the ﬁrst column, i.e., φi,0 = 1 for all i,
0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1. In (1), l1 = l2 if and only if l = 0.
4) Property 4: For l = 0, the elements of the lth column
J−1
vector sum to zero, i.e., i=0 φi,l = 0.
In practice, typical examples of Φ having Properties 1 − 4
are the N × N Hadamard and Fourier matrices with J = N .

Theorem 2: [15] Let χ be a nontrivial additive character of

Next, we deﬁne the Φ-transform of a binary sequence. Let
a = (a0 , a1 , · · · , aJ−1 ) be a binary sequence of length J and
Hamming weight K, where ai ∈ Z2 for 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1. With
a J × N matrix Φ having Properties 1 − 4, the Φ-transform
of a is deﬁned by a = (a0 , · · · , aN −1 ) = Ψ(a) · Φ, where
each element of a is given by

where i=0 φi,l = 0 for l = 0 from Property 4. From (2)

In particular, if Φ is the N × N IDFT matrix, then the Φtransform of a is equivalent to its inverse DFT. On the other
hand, if Φ is the N × N Hadamard matrix, then the Φtransform of a is equivalent to its Hadamard transform.
Construction 1 presents a framework of a codebook CΦ (a)
from a matrix Φ associated with a binary sequence a.

Corollary 1 gives a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for
CΦ (a) to be MWBE, where the proof can be found in [16].

Theorem 3 shows that Imax (CΦ (a)) is determined by the
maximum magnitude of Φ-transform of the characteristic
sequence a. Therefore, constructing a codebook CΦ (a) with
small Imax (CΦ (a)) is equivalent to ﬁnding a binary sequence a
where the maximum magnitude of its Φ-transform is as small
as possible. The discovery reveals a theoretical connection
between a binary sequence a and its associated codebook
CΦ (a) from a matrix Φ.

Construction 1: Let Φ be a J × N matrix with Properties
1 − 4, where each entry is denoted as φi,l for 0 ≤ i ≤ J − 1
and 0 ≤ l ≤ N − 1. Let a = (a0 , · · · , aJ−1 ) be a
binary sequence of length J and Hamming weight K, and
D = {d0 , · · · , dK−1 } be its support. Consider a K × N
partial matrix selecting K rows from Φ, where the selected
row indices are from D. With the scaling factor of √1 , the

A binary Sidelnikov sequence was introduced by Sidelnikov [10], and revisited by Lempel, Cohn, and Eastman [11].
We deﬁne the sequence using log operation.

Then, CΦ (a) = {c0 , c1 , · · · , cN −1 } is an (N, K) codebook
from the matrix Φ associated with the binary sequence a. We
also say that a is the characteristic sequence of CΦ (a).

Remark 1: In the codebook CF (a), the support of the binary
Sidelnikov sequence a is equivalent to the almost difference
set (ADS) in Lemma 18 of [5]. The authors of [5] conjectured
that the ADS would certainly yield a near-optimal codebook,
but failed to compute Imax (CF (a)) or its upper bound for
general N and K. Recently, we were aware that Zhang and
Feng [7] developed an upper bound on Imax (CF (a)) utilizing
the Jacobi sums, in an attempt to support the conjecture
of [5]. In Theorem 4, we presented a new upper bound on
Imax (CF (a)) that could be easily obtained by the N -point
IDFT of a binary Sidelnikov sequence, nearly meeting the
equality of the Welch bound. From numerical experiments,
we also observed that our new upper bound is tighter than

V. C ONCLUSION
This paper has described a framework for constructing a
codebook CΦ (a) from a matrix Φ associated with a binary
sequence a. In the framework, Imax (CΦ (a)) is determined
by the maximum magnitude of Φ-transform of the sequence
a. Thus, constructing a codebook with small Imax (CΦ (a)) is
equivalent to ﬁnding a binary sequence a where the maximum
magnitude in its Φ-transform is as small as possible. Compared to [4]−[9], the framework presents an efﬁcient technique
for determining the maximum possible value of Imax (CΦ (a))
for an arbitrary binary sequence a. Through the framework, we
may enjoy a freedom of choosing a variety of binary sequences
a to construct new codebooks with nontrivially bounded
Imax (CΦ (a)). Associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences,
we presented new near-optimal partial codebooks CΦ (a) by
efﬁciently proving the upper bounds of Imax (CΦ (a)), which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework.
Theoretically, this paper made a contribution of discovering a connection between binary sequences and the associated codebooks. The connection showed that various known
and new codebooks could be constructed from Fourier and
Hadamard matrices associated with binary sequences.
