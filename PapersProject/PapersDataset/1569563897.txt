Abstract—The linear deterministic interference channel (LDIC) with partial feedback is considered. Partial feedback for the
LD-IC models a scenario in which the top l most-signiﬁcant-bits
of the channel output of receiver j are received as feedback at
transmitter j, for j = 1, 2. The rationale for studying the LDIC with partial feedback comes from the fact that it is a good
approximation to the Gaussian interference channel with output
feedback corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (commonly
referred to as noisy feedback). The main contribution of this
paper is a characterization of the sum-capacity of the symmetric
LD-IC with partial feedback. The differences between the models
of partial feedback and rate-limited feedback are emphasized
and highlighted by comparing the corresponding sum-capacities,
which are shown to differ in general.

One of the most important issues for communication networks is that of interference management. Characterizing the
capacity region of the two-user Gaussian interference channel
(GIC) remains one of the fundamental unresolved problems
in information theory. Recent breakthroughs in dealing with
the capacity characterization of the GIC have made use of
the linear deterministic interference channel (LD-IC) model
[1], [2], [3]. The basic idea behind these works is that
an appropriately deﬁned LD model can serve as a good
approximation to the Gaussian channel. By gaining valuable
insights from studying the LD-IC, the proof techniques and
ideas can be lifted over to the GIC. The capacity region of
the GIC has been characterized to within 1-bit in [2].
It is well known that feedback does not increase the capacity
of the discrete memoryless point-to-point channel. However,
feedback does increase the capacity of multi-user channels.
The fact that feedback increases the capacity of the discrete
memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC) was shown by
Gaarder and Wolf [4]. Afterwards, Ozarow [5] found the
capacity region of the two-user Gaussian MAC with noiseless
feedback. Recently, Suh and Tse [6] obtained an interesting
result that noiseless feedback can provide signiﬁcant capacity
gains for the GIC. To understand the usefulness of feedback
for the interference channel, consider the case of very-strong
interference, in which the direct links are weaker than the
cross (interference) links. In such a scenario, feedback can

provide a substantial capacity increment by utilizing the alternate path of Tx1 → Rx2 → Tx2 → Rx1 , i.e., the information
intended from Tx1 ﬁrst reaches Rx2 , which is then received as
feedback at Tx2 , which utilizes the strong cross (interference)
link to reach the eventual destination at Rx1 . The approximate
capacity region of the GIC with noiseless channel output
feedback has been characterized in [6] within 2-bits. The
results in [6] have been generalized to the case of the fully
connected K-user IC [7], and the case of the cyclic K-user IC
[8]. Vahid et al. consider an interesting generalization of [6] by
studying the two-user GIC with rate-limited feedback in [9].
Rate-limited feedback refers to a setting in which the receiver
can utilize all the information it has received so far and feed
back information over an orthogonal channel of ﬁnite capacity
(i.e., a bit-pipe). Several interesting results for the GIC with
rate-limited feedback are obtained in [9].
While rate-limited feedback may be useful in scenarios in
which the feedback links have good coding schemes to protect
feedback signals from error, it places much complexity on the
receiver’s side. As a result, this model is not appropriate when
the complexity of the feedback design is a concern. In order to
take this issue into account, this paper aims to investigate the
model in which feedback signals are not well coded, and thus
suffer from corruption by noise. In particular, if the channel
output at receiver j is Yj , then the feedback to transmitter
˜
j is YF,j = gj Yj + Zj , for j = 1, 2 (see Figure 1). This
allows us to investigate the trade-off between complexity and
data rate. With the eventual goal of understanding the capacity
region of the GIC with noisy feedback, we present a linear
deterministic model with partial feedback. We show that the
LD-IC with partial feedback serves as a good approximation
to the GIC with noisy feedback. The main result of this paper

is a complete characterization of the sum-capacity of the LDIC with partial feedback.
It is worth demarcating the model of partial feedback from
the model of rate-limited feedback of [9], [10]. For the case of
rate-limited feedback of l bits, the receiver can exactly control
(encode) which l bits or functions thereof to feed back to its
corresponding transmitter. In contrast, for the case of partial
feedback, the receiver has no control over the feedback bits
since the top l most signiﬁcant bits are received as feedback.
Hence partial feedback can also be interpreted as naturally
selected limited feedback. It is hence clear that the sumcapacity with l-bits of rate-limited feedback always serves
as an upper bound on the sum-capacity with l-bits of partialfeedback. Our characterization of the sum-capacity of the LDIC with partial feedback reveals that these two models are
markedly different, and the sum-capacity with rate-limited
feedback can strictly exceed the sum-capacity with partial
feedback.

The linear deterministic interference channel with partial feedback.

capacity region of the IC with noisy feedback is deﬁned as
the closure of the set of all achievable rate pairs. With the
goal of understanding the capacity region of the GIC with
noisy feedback as deﬁned above, we next describe the linear
deterministic interference channel with partial feedback.
Using the deterministic model in [1], a non-negative integer
nkj is used to represent the channel gain from the transmitter
+
Txk to the receiver Rxj and it is given by nkj = log hkj .
Let q denote the maximum channel gains in the interference
channel, i.e., q = sup(nkj ). Thus, the transmitted signal from
the transmitter k at the time i will have a maximum of q bits
q
q
1
visible to any receiver. Denote Xki = [Xki , ..., Xki ]T ∈ F2 ,
for k = 1, 2, where the leftmost bit is the most signiﬁcant bit
and the rightmost bit is the least signiﬁcant bit. In this linear
model, the effect of interference between various signals is
captured as the superposition of those signals. At the time i,
the outputs at the receivers are given as

(2)
(3)

where Xji denotes the signal sent by transmitter j, Yji
denotes the output at receiver j, and YFj ,i denotes the
feedback received at transmitter j, for j = 1, 2, at time
˜
i, for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., T }, and {Zji }T and {Zji }T are
i=1
i=1
independent, additive white Gaussian noise processes with
zero means and unit variances. The forward channel gains
{h11 , h21 , h12 , h22 } and the feedback channel gains {g1 , g2 }
are assumed to be constant and known at all terminals. Average unit power constraints are imposed at each transmitter,
i.e., for a code of block length T , input sequences must
T
1
satisfy T E( i=1 |Xji |2 ) ≤ 1, j = 1, 2. The transmitter
Txj , for j = 1, 2, wishes to communicate a message mj ∈
{1, 2, ..., Mj } = Wj to the receiver Rxj . It is assumed that
W1 and W2 are independent. An (M1 , M2 , T, Pe ) feedback
code for the interference channel (IC) with noisy feedback
consists of a sequence of encoding functions

Y2i = S

q−n12

X1i ⊕ S

q−n22

(8)

where S is the a square shift matrix of size q and the operation
is modulo 2 addition in F2 . Similarly, the channel gains for
the feedback links can be represented by lj , for j = 1, 2,
+
g
, and hence the feedback signals
where lj = log √ j
var(Yj )

at the transmitters are given as
YF1 i = S q−l1 Y1i ,

YF2 i = S q−l2 Y2i .

(9)

Effectively, via the feedback links, the transmitter j sees only
the top lj bits of the received signals Rji (see Figure 2).
The focus of this paper is on the symmetric LD-IC in which
m = n12 = n21 , n = n11 = n22 , and l = l1 = l2 .

Moreover, from Theorem 1, it is clear that all of the
inequalities above can be strict inequalities in general, depending on the relative values of (α, β). As an example, we
have shown all four sum-capacities as functions of α, when
β = 9/8 in Figure 3; and when β = 5/8 in Figure 4. The
effect of feedback on the sum-capacity of the partial feedback
model differs from that of the rate-limited feedback model.
The feedback helps to increase the sum rate only when the
feedback rate is greater than a certain threshold depending on
the speciﬁc regime. The threshold is found to be equal to half
of the sum-capacities in the model of no feedback. Intuitively,
there is a tradeoff between complexity and capacity here.
Case 1: Very weak interference: 0 ≤ α ≤ 1
2
In this regime, feedback does not increase the sum-capacity
∗
CP−FB when 0 ≤ β ≤ 1 − α. The sum-capacity starts
to increase when 1 − α ≤ β. The difference between our
∗
normalized sum-capacity CP−FB and the sum-capacity in rate∗
limited feedback model CRL−FB is exactly 2(1 − α) in this
case. The intuition behind this result is that the top n(1 − α)
bits of the feedback are received perfectly by the intended
receiver. Thus, feedback is redundant when the feedback link
is too small.
Case 2: Weak interference: 1 ≤ α ≤ 2
2
3
The result in this case differs from the previous case. In this
regime, feedback does not increase the sum-capacity when
0 ≤ β ≤ α. The sum-capacity starts to increase when α ≤
β. This result is counter-intuitive. Notice that only the top
n(1 − α) bits of the feedback are already received perfectly
by the intended receiver. The result here reﬂects the nature of
∗
interference in this regime. The difference between CP−FB
∗
and CRL−FB is 2α in this regime.
Case 3: Moderate to strong interference: 2 ≤ α ≤ 2

The detailed proof of Theorem 1 is omitted due to space
limitations and can be found in [11]. In comparison, we recall
here the corresponding (normalized) sum-capacities without

In this regime, the sum-capacity starts to increase only
when 1 ≤ β. Notice that this is the case of very strong
interference, where all the bits in all positions are interfered

when the rate of feedback is greater than the direct link’s. The

We can repeat this encoding scheme again for a duration of

achieves a sum rate of 8 bits/channel use, which matches with
the normalized sum rate of 2β as stated in Theorem 1.

In this subsection, we consider the speciﬁc example, where
n = 7, m = 4 and l = 5. This corresponds to the case α ≤
β ≤ 1 (see Figure 6). From the ﬁgure, we can see that a
sum rate of 10 bits/channel use, i.e., a normalized rate of
2α is asymptotically achievable, matching with the result in
Theorem 1.

IV. C ODING SCHEMES
In this section, sum-capacity achieving coding schemes for
speciﬁc values of (n, m, l) are presented. Gaining intuition
from these examples, encoding schemes for arbitrary (n, m, l)
are deduced in [11]. The converse is partially presented in the
Appendix.

The interference channel with n = 1, m = 6, l = 2, i.e.,
α = 6, β = 2 is considered (see Figure 7). From the ﬁgure,
it is easy to see that a sum rate of 4 bits/channel use, or a
normalized sum rate of 2β is achievable, matching the result
in Theorem 1.

In this subsection, we present a capacity achieving encoding
scheme for n = 6, m = 3, l = 4, to build intuition for
the general case. Based on the example, a general encoding
scheme can be deduced (see Figure 5). From the previous
section, it is clear that the sum-capacity with no feedback
is 6, with full feedback is 9, and with rate-limited feedback
(of 4 bits) is also 9. Whereas, the sum-capacity with partial
feedback of l = 4 bits is 8 bits/channel use. To this end,
we will show that it is possible to achieve the rate pair
(R1 , R2 ) = (4, 4) for the LD-IC in consideration.
In the ﬁrst time slot t = 1, each transmitter sends 4 fresh
information bits as shown in the ﬁgure. With a feedback
channel gain l = 4, Tx1 sees only the top 4 bits, which
are a1 , −, −, a2 ⊕ b1 , and hence it can recover b1 . Notice
that the feedback signal a1 is redundant since it is already
received cleanly at the intended transmitter Rx1 . This is the
price we have to pay for partial feedback in contrast to ratelimited feedback. In the second time slot i = 2, the transmitter
Tx1 sends 4 new fresh information bits again and encodes b1
at the second topmost signal level as shown in the ﬁgure.
The second topmost signal level is chosen to ensure that the
resolving signal bit b1 is received cleanly at Tx1 . With the
help of b1 , Rx1 can resolve the interference in the previous
time slot and decode a2 successfully. Due to symmetry, the
same encoding operation is carried out at Tx2 and Rx2 .

V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have characterized the sum-capacity region
of the deterministic interference channel with partial feedback.
In addition, our result has been analyzed and compared
with three other related models: without feedback, with full
feedback and with rate-limited feedback. Being different from
the rate-limited model, the feedback in our model helps to
improve the sum-capacity only when the channel gains for
the feedback links exceed certain thresholds, depending on
the speciﬁc regimes. As on-going work, we are focusing on
the capacity region of the GIC with output feedback corrupted
by additive white Gaussian noise.
VI. A PPENDIX
A. Proof for very strong interference: 2 ≤ α
In this section, we present a sum-capacity achieving encoding scheme and a converse proof for the very strong
interference regime (2 ≤ α). The proof for the other regimes
can be found in [11].

1) Encoding Scheme for (n, m, l) such that 2n ≤ m.: For
the case of strong interference, max(m, n) = m. The set of
m bits at the transmitter Tx1 (respectively Tx2 ) is partitioned
into 3 regions A1 , A2 , A3 , with sizes (n, m − 2n, n). According to the partition sizes, the m bits (channel output) received
at Rx1 can be described by: Y1 = (B1 , B2 , B3 ⊕ A1 ) (see
Figure 8). From Theorem 1, it is clear that feedback increases
sum-capacity only if l > n. Hence, we focus on the case in
which n < l.
In all time instances, Tx1 encodes n fresh information bits
in A1 . An additional E11 bits are encoded in the region A2 .
The optimal size of E11 is a function of (l, m, n), which is
chosen as min((l − n), m − n). It remains silent in region

A3 to avoid interference. Similarly, Tx2 sends fresh bits in
(B1 , E21 ) and remains silent in B3 .
In this ﬁrst time slot, Rx2 can receive E11 cleanly; however
Rx1 cannot. Moreover, via feedback of l most signiﬁcant
bits, Tx2 has access to E11 and Tx1 has access to E21 . In
the second time slot, Tx1 , besides sending fresh bits in the
top min(l, m ) levels, forwards the bits E21 in the remaining
2
part of A2 . Similarly, Tx2 forwards the bits E11 in the
remaining part of B2 . Thus, in this second time slot, Rx1
can receive E11 , and Rx2 can receive E21 . From the third
time slot onwards, the same operation is repeated. A sum
rate of min(2l, m) bits/channel use, or a normalized rate of
min(2β, α) is achievable.

2) Converse for (n, m, l) such that 2n ≤ m.: Let YFj
for j = 1, 2, denote the feedback from Rxj to Txj in the
duration of T channel uses. Please refer to Figure 8 for the
partition. We ﬁrst state the following lemma, which gives an
upper bound on R1 and R2 .

where (a) follows from the independence between W1 and

and Y1 is a function of (A1 , X2 ) and (c) follows from Fano’s

inequality. We next bound the term H(AT , YF2 ).

Case 1: 0 ≤ l ≤ n. For this case, YF2 is a function of AT

and we have H(AT ) ≤ nT .

Case 2: n ≤ l ≤ m. In this case, AT is a function of YF2 .

We have H(YF2 ) ≤ lT .
From both these cases, we conclude that R1 ≤ n+(l−n)+ .
The inequality for R2 can be proved in a similar manner.
From Lemma 1, we have R1 + R2 ≤ 2n + 2(l − n)+ , thus
proving the converse for the regime α ≥ 2.
