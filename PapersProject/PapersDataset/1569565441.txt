Abstract—We consider a simple multi-hop communication scenario composed of a source node, a relay node and a destination
node where the source and the relay can harvest energy from the
nature. Energy required for communication arrives (is harvested)
at the transmitter and an unlimited battery stores it before being
consumed for transmission. In addition, the source can assist the
relay by transferring a portion of its energy to the relay through a
separate energy transfer unit. We address this energy cooperation
between the source and the relay in a deterministic setting.
Assuming that the source and the relay nodes are informed of
the energy arrivals in advance, we ﬁnd jointly optimal ofﬂine
energy management policies for the source and the relay that
maximize the end-to-end throughput. We show that this problem
is a convex problem. In order to gain insight about the structure
of the solution, we consider speciﬁc scenarios. In particular, we
show that if the relay energy proﬁle is higher at the beginning
and lower at the end with only one intersection, then matching
the power sequences of the source and the relay slot-by-slot is
optimal. We also consider the case when the energy of the source
is available at the beginning and show that transferring energy
in the ﬁrst slot is optimal.

management policies of the source and the relay in this
multi-hop communication scenario with energy harvesting and
wireless energy transfer.
Ofﬂine throughput maximization for an energy harvesting
transmitter has been recently analyzed by many researchers
[2]–[12]. In [2]–[4], the problem of throughput maximization
by a deadline is solved for an energy harvesting transmitter
in a static channel. In [5]–[10], the throughput maximization
problem and its solution are extended to fading, broadcast and
multiple access channels. In [11], [12], end-to-end throughput
maximization problem is solved in a two-hop cooperative
network where jointly optimal policy for the source and the
relay turns out to be separable: The source performs singleuser throughput maximization subject to its own energy arrival
proﬁle without regard to the relay energy proﬁle and the
relay adapts its transmission policy according to the data ﬂow
coming from the source as well as its own energy arrival
proﬁle. Moreover, this separable solution is not unique and
thus there may be other optimal solutions that spend less
energy at the source [11]. Unlike the problem in [11], [12], in
our problem where energy cooperation is possible, the source
is forced to be energy efﬁcient so that it can further increase
the throughput by sending some of its energy to the relay.
Another related line of research in wireless communications
with energy harvesting nodes has been presented in [13]–[15].
In [13], capacity-energy function in simultaneous information
and energy transfer is introduced and in [14] the tradeoff
between the information rate and power transfer in a practical frequency selective wireless system is investigated. In
[15], the tradeoff between energy and information transfer is
characterized in a MIMO broadcast system. While the energy

I. I NTRODUCTION
User cooperation, achieved by means of relays, is known
to enhance the system throughput in wireless communications
[1]. In the classical setting of cooperation, relays help users
in the transmission of their data by exploiting the broadcast
nature of the wireless network. In this work, we anticipate
an energy harvesting network where the nodes can share
their energy as well as their information. We investigate
an additional dimension of cooperation which involves the
sharing of energy resources and can be described as energy
cooperation.
We consider a simple multi-hop wireless communication
system composed of a source node, a relay node and a
destination node where the source and the relay nodes can
harvest energy from the nature through various different
sources, such as solar cells, vibration absorption devices, water
mills, thermoelectric generators, etc. In particular, these nodes
maintain the energy required for data transmission from the
harvested energy after it is buffered in a rechargeable battery.
Moreover, we assume that the source node can transfer a
portion of its energy to the relay node as in Fig. 1 through a
separate wireless energy transfer unit subject to an attenuation
factor and a delay. We will address optimization of the energy

transfer in [13]–[15] is based on the RF technology which may
be undesirable due to its inefﬁciency, there are other methods
of wireless energy transfer based on magnetic coils that are
known to be more efﬁcient [16], [17].
Relying on the possibility of efﬁcient energy transfer [16],
[17], in this paper, we consider a two-hop communication network with energy harvesting nodes where the source assists the
relay by transferring some of its energy. We extend the works
in [11], [12] and formulate the end-to-end ofﬂine throughput
maximization problem with wireless energy transfer subject to
energy causality at both nodes and data causality at the relay
node. We show that this problem is a convex optimization
problem. In order to gain insight about the structure of the
solution, we consider speciﬁc scenarios. If the relay energy
proﬁle is higher at the beginning and lower at the end with
crossing only once, we show that slot-by-slot matching the
power sequences of the source and the relay is optimal.
Moreover, when the energy of the source is available at the
beginning, transferring energy in the ﬁrst slot is optimal. Our
work reveals further relations between the problem of data
transmission with an energy harvesting transmitter in [2]–[4]
and the problem of energy minimal data transmission in [18],
[19] under delay constraints.

with amounts E1 , E2 , . . . , ET . We assume an energy transfer
efﬁciency of α, where 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. This means that when
the source transfers δi amount of energy to the relay through
the wireless energy transfer unit, αδi amount of energy enters
the energy queue of the relay in the next slot. Similarly, the
source uses Pi power for data transmission and the data queue
of the relay is increased by 1 log (1 + Pi ) bits in the next slot.

Therefore, the source and relay queues are updated with one
slot delay as shown in Fig. 2. Power policy of the source is
¯
the sequence Pi and δi ; power policy of the relay is Pi .
As the energy that has not arrived yet cannot be used for
data transmission or energy transfer, the power policies of the
source and the relay are constrained by the causality of energy
in time. In particular, energy causality constraints are given as

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a two-hop network consisting of a source node,
a relay node and a destination node as shown in Fig. 1. The
two queues at the source and the destination nodes are the data
and energy queues. The energies that arrive at the source and
the destination nodes are saved in the corresponding energy
queues. The data queue of the source always carries some data
packets to be delivered to the destination. The data packets
sent from the source cause a depletion of the energy from
the source energy queue and an increase in the relay data
queue. Then, they are served out of this queue with a cost of
energy depletion from the relay energy queue. We assume that
the data and energy buffers are unlimited. In addition, energy
expenditure is only due to data transmission; any other energy
costs, e.g., processing, is not considered. There is a separate
wireless energy transfer unit from the source to the relay and
therefore, the source may wish to send a portion of its energy
to the relay so that the relay can forward more data.
We assume additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels from the source to the relay and from the relay to the
destination. The received signals yr and yd at√ relay and the
the
destination, respectively, are given by yr = hs xs + ns and
√
yd = hr xr + nr , where hs and hr are the fading coefﬁcients
for the source-to-relay channel and the relay-to-destination
channel, respectively. ns and nr are Gaussian noises each with
zero-mean and unit-variance. We assume that hs = hr = 1
without loss of generality as otherwise the energy arrivals can
be properly scaled. The relay operates in full-duplex mode.
Time is slotted and there are a total of T equal length slots.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the length of each
slot is unity. At times t = 1, . . . , T , the source harvests energy
with amounts E1 , E2 , . . . , ET and the relay harvests energy

Proof: Suppose the stated constraint is satisﬁed with

strict inequality. Then, we can increase some δi , increase Pi
and decrease Pi without violating the energy constraints and
improve the overall throughput which contradicts the fact that

Pi∗ , Pi∗ and δi are optimal.
We note that if the relay energy proﬁle is sufﬁcient to
forward all the bits in the optimal source data stream with
respect to the source energy proﬁle, that is, if the separable
policy in [11], [12] yields a policy that satisﬁes the necessary
condition in Lemma 1, then it is the optimal solution for (4)
and energy transfer is not needed. In fact, any energy transfer
from source to relay causes a strict suboptimality in this case.
The second observation about the optimal policy is that the
source has to exhaust the energies that have been harvested
throughout the communication session either for data transmission or in the form of energy transfer.

The Lagrange multiplier ρk is due to the constraint that

III. N ECESSARY O PTIMALITY C ONDITIONS
The ﬁrst necessary optimality condition for (4) is that the
source has to send as many bits as the relay can send and the
relay has to ﬁnish up all the data in its data buffer. In other
words, in the optimal policy, no data is left in the data queue
of the relay at the end.

The problem in (5) is a convex optimization problem as
the objective function is concave and the feasible set is a

have no data to send at that slot. Allocating a small portion of energy for
source transmission strictly increases the throughput in this case.

Another necessary condition satisﬁed by the optimal policy
is energy minimality. Consider the energy minimization

this case, ∃i, δi = 0, i.e., some energy transfer is needed.
Finally, we observe that if there is a nonzero energy transfer
from the source to the relay, then the relay has to exhaust all

IV. S PECIFIC S CENARIOS
In this section, we examine speciﬁc scenarios corresponding
to practically interesting cases such as the cases of the source
or the relay with a ﬁxed energy battery. Furthermore, they
provide useful insights on how to optimally allocate power
and transfer energy simultaneously.
A. Relay Energy Higher at the Beginning Lower at the End
We consider the scenario where the relay energy arrival
proﬁle is higher at the beginning, intersects the energy arrival
proﬁle of the source only once and remains lower till the end
of the communication as shown in Fig. 3. In particular, we
i

also covers the setting where the relay is non energy harvesting

A particular case covered is when only the source has

available, i.e., E1 > 0 and Ei = 0, i > 1. If E1 > i=1 Ei ,
the relay can forward all the bits sent from the source and the
T

optimal policy is trivial. If E1 < i=1 Ei , the optimal policy
is obtained by forming a common energy proﬁle via energy
transfer and matching the power and rate sequences. Another

special case is when ˜ = 0, i.e., when Ei < Ei for all i. In

B. Source Energy Available at the Beginning
In this section, we consider the scenario where the source
has all the available energy in the beginning (i.e., E1 > 0 only)
and the relay harvests energy throughout the communication.
Let the relay energy proﬁle not be satisfactory to forward
the optimal source data stream which has constant rate E1 .
T
Assume δi = 0 for some i. Since the source is not harvesting
energy, the total energy of the source will then be E1 − δi
−δ
yielding an optimal transmission power of E1T i . Hence, the
throughput of the source is independent of the slot index i the
energy is transferred. However, transferring the energy at slot
j < i can only increase the powers after that slot; therefore,
energy transfer has to be performed as early as possible, i.e.,
∗
at the ﬁrst slot. Hence, the jointly optimal policy is δ1 = 0
∗
and δi = 0 for the remaining slots as shown in Fig. 4. Note
that the power sequences of the source and the relay are not
∗
matched. δ1 is found by solving a ﬁxed point equation:

V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we considered a two-hop communication
network with energy harvesting rechargeable nodes where the
source node and the relay node are in energy as well as signal
cooperation: the relay assists the source node by forwarding
the data to the destination; the source assists the relay by
transferring a portion of its energy to the relay. We formulated
the ofﬂine end-to-end throughput maximization problem with
energy transfer from the source to the relay subject to energy
causality at both nodes and data causality at the relay node
and we showed that it is a convex optimization problem. We
studied speciﬁc cases in detail, e.g., when the relay energy
proﬁle is initially higher and then lower with one crossing, as
well as the case when the source energy is constant.
