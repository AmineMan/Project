rates, have been analyzed for eclectic antenna conﬁgurations
at the transmitter, receiver, and eavesdropper. In particular,
it has been shown that the optimal input covariance matrix
that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate is of rank one
(i.e., beamforming) for a multiple-input single-output (MISO)
case [5]–[8]. Moreover, the on-off power control is the optimal policy that maximizes the perfect secrecy rate achieved
by beamforming in the direction of the legitimate channel
when full channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper
channel is infeasible at the transmitter [7]. However, the
degree of freedom for conﬁdential transmission in this case
vanishes due to a single high-SNR degree of freedom for
communication by beamforming in both the legitimate and
eavesdropper channels [7], [8]. This degree of freedom can
be recovered by exploiting the simulated interfering signal
or the so-called artiﬁcial noise [9], [10]. For example, by
transmitting the information-bearing signal in the direction of
the legitimate channel along with the artiﬁcial noise in its null
space, the artiﬁcial noise behaves as interference only in the
eavesdropper channel to remove the high-SNR communication
degree of eavesdropping without interfering on the legitimate
link [9], [10]. The power allocation problem between the
information signal and artiﬁcial noise was treated to maximize
the achievable secrecy rate for the worst-case scenario [10].1
In this paper, we consider secure communication over a
multiple-input single-output Rayleigh-fading channel in the
presence of a multiple-antenna eavesdropper—referred to as
a multiple-input single-output multiple-eavesdropper (MISOME) wiretap channel. More speciﬁcally, we deal with secure
beamforming with artiﬁcial noise when the transmitter has
access to full CSI of a legitimate channel but only partial
statistical CSI of an eavesdropper channel (as in [7], [10] for
a practical design). We ﬁrst treat the power allocation problem
between the information-bearing signal and artiﬁcial noise to
maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the MISOME wiretap
channel in the presence of a weak (low-SNR) or strong (highSNR) eavesdropper (see Theorems 1 and 2). We then develop
a near-optimal power allocation strategy in a switched fashion
for a general case (see Theorem 3); and derive the ergodic
MISOME secrecy rate achieved by secure beamforming with
this switched power allocation in closed form (see Theorem 4).

Abstract—In this paper, we consider secure communication
over a multiple-input single-output Rayleigh-fading channel in
the presence of a multiple-antenna eavesdropper—referred to as
a multiple-input single-output multiple-eavesdropper (MISOME)
wiretap channel. Speciﬁcally, secure beamforming with artiﬁcial
noise is treated when the transmitter has access to full channel
state information (CSI) of a legitimate channel but only partial
statistical CSI of an eavesdropper channel. We ﬁrst derive the
optimal power allocation between the information-bearing signal
and artiﬁcial noise (or simulated interference) to maximize the
achievable secrecy rate in the presence of a weak or strong
eavesdropper. We then develop a near-optimal power allocation
strategy in a switched fashion for a general case and derive a
closed-form expression for the ergodic secrecy rate achieved by
secure beamforming with this switched power allocation in the
MISOME wiretap channel.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Recent advances in wireless networking technologies are
growing rapidly, evidenced by diverse types of wireless networks such as wireless local area networks, wireless personal
area network, cellular networks, ad-hoc networks, mesh networks, vehicular networks, femtocell networks, and sensor
networks. However, the broadcast nature of wireless medium
makes wireless networks susceptible to eavesdropping and
hence, secure transmission is a fundamental issue in such
networks. This problem has been typically addressed at the
application layer in which the transmitted bits are scrambled
using a secret key shared between a pair of communication
nodes. Shannon [1] laid the early foundations on the fundamental limit to secrecy systems and has shown that the
conditional probability of the cryptogram given a message
must be independent of the actual transmitted message to
achieve perfect secrecy of communication, while Wyner [2]
established a wiretap channel formulation and has shown
that the perfect secrecy is achievable when the eavesdropper
channel is a degraded version of the legitimate channel. The
goal of intrinsically secure networks is to exploit the structure
of a underlying broadcast channel to transmit a message
reliably to the intended receiver, while minimizing information
leakage to the eavesdropper [3], [4].
In parallel with the potential beneﬁts of multiple-antenna
systems to the achievable communication rate and reliability in
wireless channels, the use of multiple antennas has been extensively invoked to enhance the communication conﬁdentiality
in the physical layer [5]–[8]. The secrecy capacity, achievable

In this section, we ﬁrst determine the optimal power allocation that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate in (6) for a
weak (low-SNR) or strong (high-SNR) eavesdropper. We then
develop a switched power allocation strategy that solves (6)
in a general case and derive the ergodic secrecy rate with this
power allocation.

The optimal power allocation that maximizes the achievable
secrecy rate Ês can be found by solving the optimization
problem in (6). However, the optimal value λ of λ that
maximizes the secrecy rate Ês is hard to be analytically
determined due to the non-convexity of Ê (λ) in (6). In the
following, we ﬁrst solve the power allocation problem for a
weak or strong eavesdropper, and show how we can extend
these results to develop a near-optimal solution in a general
case.

and ×ÒÖe are the average received SNRs per antenna at the

respectively. All the random quantities Ü , r , À e , Þr , and Þ e are
mutually independent.
For conﬁdential communication, the transmitter can use
artiﬁcial noise to cause interference to the eavesdropper. In
this case, the transmitted signal can be divided into the
information-bearing signal and artiﬁcial noise as [9], [10]

and the nt × (nt − 1) beamforming matrix for the information
signal and artiﬁcial noise, respectively; and λ ∈ [0, 1] is the
power allocation ﬁgure, i.e., a ratio between the information
signal power and total power. In the following, we consider
that the transmitter has full CSI only for the legitimate channel
and partial CSI for the eavesdropper channel. By partial CSI,
we refer to only knowledge of the statistics of CSI. With this
assumption, it is reasonable to choose Ù I = † / r , i.e., the

Remark 1: For a weak (low-SNR) eavesdropper, the transmitter should use all the power for conﬁdential signal transmission. In this case, it is not necessary to use artiﬁcial noise to
interfere with the eavesdropper since thermal noise is enough
to disturb the signal reception at the eavesdropper. As a result,
the on-off power allocation is optimal [7].
Remark 2: The on-off threshold ζ↓ decreases inversely with
×ÒÖr , whereas it grows with ne and ×ÒÖe . As ×ÒÖr , ×ÒÖe → 0,
we have

where (a) follows from the fact that limz→∞ ez En (z) = 0 for
n ∈ Z++ and (b) follows from the fact that (n − 1) En (z) =
e−z −zEn−1 (z). Intuitively, this property implies that the frequency of transmission by the legitimate transmitter increases
with ×ÒÖr . This directly improves the ﬁrst term in (8). However,
as ne increases, the eavesdropper link becomes more reliable
and naturally the legitimate transmitter attempts to send the
information less often.

Remark 3: It follows from Theorem 2 that the optimal
value of λ for a strong (high-SNR) eavesdropper is equal to
λ↑ = 1/κ . Note that this optimal value does not depend on
r and the average SNRs at both receivers. It is only a function
of the antenna numbers nt and ne . Therefore, a simple
deterministic power allocation is sufﬁcient for achieving the
maximal secrecy rate and there is no need to implement any
adaptive power allocation for the strong eavesdropper.3
3) Switched Strategy: In general, it is infeasible to analytically derive the optimal value of λ due to the non-convexity of
the objective function in (6). Therefore, we propose a switched
power allocation as described in the following theorem.

found directly from (6) by using the numerical method. We
can see that λ for the weak (low-SNR) or strong (high-SNR)
eavesdropper converges to λs as stated in Theorems 1 and 2,
respectively. Hence, we can use the switched power allocation
in practical design for simplifying the computational complexity while the ergodic secrecy rate remains near-optimally.
Fig. 2 shows the ergodic secrecy rates Ês for the switched
and optimal power allocations as a function of ×ÒÖr when
nt = 3, ne = 1; nt = 3, ne = 2; and nt = 4, ne = 2 for
×ÒÖe = ×ÒÖr . We observe that the ergodic secrecy rate for the
switched power allocation is very tight to the optimal secrecy
rate over the whole SNR regime, showing that the switched
power allocation can be used instead of the optimal power
allocation without much losing the secrecy rate.

In this paper, we investigated secure beamforming with
the artiﬁcial noise in MISOME wiretap channels. We determined the on-off and decisive power allocations between the
information-bearing signal and artiﬁcial noise to maximize
the achievable secrecy rate for weak (low-SNR) and strong
(high-SNR) eavesdropping; developed the near-optimal power
control regulated in a switched fashion for the general eavesdropping case; and derived the ergodic MISOME secrecy rate
achieved by secure beamforming with the switched power
policy.
