with I-CSIT. We show analytically that the proposed precoding
technique is optimal in the sense of the rate maximization
under the I-CSIT assumption, provided that the other
transmitters are a priori fixed to the same precoding structure.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme with
I-CSIT performs close to the system capacity with full CSIT.

Abstract—In this paper, we consider a distributed MIMO
communication network in which multiple transmitters
cooperatively send common messages to a single receiver. In this
scenario, it is usually costly to acquire full channel state
information at the transmitters (CSIT), i.e., every transmitter
perfectly knows the overall channel state information (CSI) of the
network. Hence, we assume individual CSIT (I-CSIT), i.e., each
transmitter only knows its own CSI. We propose a novel
precoding technique, named Hermitian precoding, to enhance the
system performance under the constraint of I-CSIT. We show
that the proposed scheme can perform close to the system
capacity with full CSIT. This reveals that the amount of CSI
required at the transmitters can be significantly reduced without
considerably compromising performance.

SYSTEM MODEL

A. System Model
We describe the system model for the distributed MIMO
system, in which K transmitters send common messages to a
single receiver. Each transmitter k, k = 1, …, K, is equipped
with N antennas and the receiver is equipped with M antennas.
The received signal at the receiver can be expressed as

INTRODUCTION

K

r = ∑ H k xk + n

Consider a distributive communication system in which
multiple transmitters located at different places cooperatively
send common messages to a single receiver. This scenario
arises, e.g., in the following two applications.
• In a cooperative cellular system, several adjacent base
stations (BSs) simultaneously serve a mobile terminal
(MT) in the downlink transmission [1]. Such a scheme is
referred to as coordinated multi-point (CoMP) [2]-[4] in
long term evolution (LTE) standardization documents [5].
• In a parallel relaying system, multiple relays decode and
forward (DF) messages from a common source to a
common destination [6]-[8].
Intensive work has been focused on this scenario under
various assumptions on the availability of channel state
information at the transmitters (CSIT). In [7]-[8] no CSIT is
assumed and distributed space-time coding is proposed for
efficient transmission. In [1]-[5] full CSIT is assumed, i.e.,
every transmitter perfectly knows all the channel state
information (CSI). With full CSIT, beamforming is performed
jointly among the transmitters to enhance the system
performance significantly.
However, in practice, it is very costly to acquire full CSI at
all transmitters. This problem is especially serious in multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems in which multiple
antennas are employed in transmission. The resulting overall
system may have a very large dimension. Distributing all these
coefficients to all transmitters can be a daunting task.
In this paper, we study the situation of individual CSIT (ICSIT), in which each transmitter has the CSI of its own link
but not other’s. This setting can significantly decrease the
overhead for distributing CSI among transmitters. We develop
a Hermitian precoding technique for efficient transmission

B. Haar Matrix
Definition 1: A random square matrix U is called a Haar
matrix if it is uniformly distributed on the set of all the unitary
matrices (of the same size as U) [9]1.
Property 1: [p.25, 9] A Haar matrix U is unitarily invariant,
i.e., for any fixed unitary matrix T independent of U, the
statistical behavior of TU or UT is the same as U.
Property 2: [p.25, 9] Consider a random Hermitian matrix
B given by B = UΛUH, with U being a Haar matrix and Λ
being a random diagonal matrix. Assume that U and Λ are
independent of each other. Then B is unitarily invariant, i.e.,
for any unitary matrix T independent of B, TBTH has the same
distribution as B. Also, B* has the same distribution as B.

A Haar matrix is also called an isotropic matrix in [10]. More detail about
Haar matrices can be found in [9], [11].

Now we describe some useful properties of {Hk}.
Throughout this paper, the entries of Hk, k = 1, …, K, are
assumed to be i.i.d. random variables drawn from CN(0, σk2).2

A. Modeling of the Transmit Signals
Recall that all the transmitters share the same message to be
sent to a single receiver. Yet, the transmitters still have the
freedom to use the same codebook or different codebooks in
channel coding. Hence the transmitted signals {xk} may be
either correlated or uncorrelated. We use c0 to represent the
correlated signal component shared by all the transmitters, and
ck to represent the uncorrelated signal component for
K
transmitter k (for k = 1, …, K), where {ck }k = 0 are M-by-1
random vectors with the entries independently drawn from
CN(0, 1). By definition, E[ckckH] = I and E[ckcjH] = 0, ∀k, j = 0,
1, …, K, k ≠ j. Then, the transmitted signal of transmitter k can
be expressed as

where the expectation is taken over {Hk′ | k′ = 1, …, K, k′ ≠ k }.
In other words, any particular transmitter k deviating from its
own precoding strategy leads to performance degradation.
IV.

HERMITIAN PRECODING

A. Hermitian Precoding
Recall the SVD of Hk in (3) as Hk = UkDkVkH. As Uk and Vk
are unitary, the precoders in (6) can always be written in the
following form: for any k = 1, …, K,
Fk = f ( H k ) = VkWk U kH and Gk = g ( H k ) = Vk Σ k U kH , (9)
where Wk and Σk can be arbitrary N-by-M matrices except that
they only depend on Hk (due to the I-CSIT assumption). We
have the following result with the proof given in Appendix.
Theorem 1: The optimal {Fk} and {Gk} to (8) are given by
(9) with {Wk} and {ΣkΣkH} being real and diagonal matrices.
Theorem 1 gives the optimal structure of the precoders for
the problem defined in (8).

(4)

where Fk and Gk are N-by-M precoding matrices that is
adaptive to the channel. With (4), we rewrite (1) as
K

r = ∑ H k ( Fk c0 + Gk ck ) + n .

∑H

where |A|2 is a shorthand of AAH for any matrix A, the
expectation in (7) is taken over the joint distribution of {Hk | k
= 1, …, K}, and the power constraint is imposed on every
possible realization of Hk, k = 1, …, K.

Based on Property 4, the properties of Haar matrix in
Subsection B hold for Uk.

We focus on the design of {Fk} and {Gk} in the following.
B. Problem Formulation
We are interested in the following distributive precoder:
Fk = f k ( H k ), and Gk = g k ( H k ), k = 1, …, K
(6)
where “distributive” means that the precoders of each
transmitter k only depends on the local CSI of transmitter k,
i.e., fk(·) and gk(·) are functions of Hk only (but not functions of
{Hk′, k′ ≠ k}). This ensures that the precoding scheme in (6)
can be realized under the I-CSIT assumption.
The distributive precoding functions {fk(·)} and {gk(·)}
should be optimized to maximize the average achievable rate
of the system in (5) under the individual transmitter power
constraints in (2). This problem can be formulated as

B. Further Discussions
With Theorem 1, we still need to optimize {Wk} and {Σk}
for power allocation based on available CSI. Due to space
limitation, we only consider a simple choice of Wk and Σk as
Wk = Pk M I and Σk = 0.
(10)
More advanced power allocation strategies are discussed in
[12]. The reason for Σk = 0 is intuitively explained as follows.
Consider the multiple-input single-output (MISO) case
(i.e., N ≥ M =1). The channels {Hk} reduce to vectors {hk} and
allow the expression of hk = hk 2 vkH , where vk = hkH hk 2 ,
for k = 1, …, K. Then, it is easy to see that the optimal
precoding strategy to the problem in (7) is given by

2

The results in this paper directly hold for other fading channels, provided
that the channel directions {Uk} are Haar matrices.

Here the term diagonal matrix refers to rectangular diagonal matrix with
only the (i, i)th i = 1, …, min{M, N} entries possibly non-zero.

Fk = f k (hk ) = Pk vk , and Gk = g k (hk ) = 0 , k = 1, …, K. (11)
Correspondingly, the received signal can be expressed as

2

 K

r =  ∑ Pk hk 2  c0 + n
(12)
 k =1

where r, c0, and n are respectively the scalar versions of r, c0,
and n. In (12), we see that the signals from different
transmitters are coherently superimposed on each other. Based
on the above observation, it is reasonable to expect that Gk = 0
(or Σk = 0) is also a good choice for the MIMO cases.
From the above, our proposed precoding strategy is
Fk = f k ( H k ) = VkWk U kH and Gk = g k ( H k ) = 0 . (13)
With (13), the received signal in (5) can be rewritten as
 K

r =  ∑ U k DkWk U kH  c0 + n .
(14)
 k =1

Clearly, each term UkDkWkUkH in (14) is a positive semidefinite Hermitian matrix. From Weyl Theorem [13], for any
positive semi-definite matrices A and B, we have
A (or B ) A + B . Hence, our proposed precoding strategy in
(13) increases the eigen-values of the overall equivalent
channel, which provides an intuitive explanation of the related
gain. This can be seen as the effect of coherent transmission.

NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, numerical results are provided to evaluate
the performance of the proposed Hermitian precoding
technique in distributed MIMO channels. Some alternative
schemes are listed below for comparison. For simplicity of
discussion, we always assume N = M.
(i) Hermitian Precoding with Equal Power Allocation (HPFk = Pk M Vk U kH and Gk = 0.
EPA):
This is obtained by substituting Wk = Pk M I in (13).
(ii) Hermitian Precoding with Channel Inverse (HP-CI):
Fk = β kVk Dk−1U kH and Gk = 0.
This is obtained by substituting Wk = β k Dk−1 in (13) with
βk a scalar chosen to meet the power constraint.
(iii) No CSIT with fully Correlated Signaling (No-CSIT-CS):
Fk = Pk M I and Gk = 0.
(iv) No CSIT with Independent Signaling (No-CSIT-IS):
Fk = 0 and Gk = Pk M I .
(v) Individual Water-Filling (IWF):
Fk = VkWk and Gk = 0.
Here Vk is obtained from the SVD Hk = UkDkVkH and Wk
(that is diagonal) is obtained by water-filling over Dk. In
other words, IWF applies standard water-filling [14] at
each individual transmitter.
Note that the only difference between (i) and (ii) is the choice
of Wk. They both have the Hermitian precoding structure. On
the other hand, the choices (iii)–(v) do not involve the
Hermitian precoding structure, and thus lack the coherent
transmission effect discussed in Section IV.C.
Fig.1 illustrates the performance of various precoding
schemes with K = 3, N = 16, and M = 8. It is seen that HPEPA performs very close to the upper bound obtained by
assuming full CSIT (as studied in [3]). This implies that the
potential performance loss due to the I-CSIT assumption is
marginal. We also see that HP-EPA significantly outperforms
other alternatives. Note that the performance of No-CSIT-CS,

precoding scheme with EPA and the channel capacity with full-CSIT and NoCSIT-IS. All transmitters have the same power constraint P, and SNR = P/σ2.
M = 4, N = 16. The values of K are marked on the curves.

No-CSIT-IS and IWF is relatively poor in Fig. 1. The reason is
that they cannot achieve the coherent effect provided by the
Hermitian precoding structure.
Fig.2 studies the impact of the numbers of transmitters on
the performance of Hermitian precoding. The numbers of
antennas are set to M = 4 and N = 16. The performance curves
with full-CSIT and No-CSIT-IS are also included for
comparison. Again, the gap between the Hermitian precoding
scheme and the full-CSIT capacity is very small. Compared
with the curve of No-CSIT-IS, the power gain of the proposed
precoder is about 9 dB for K = 2, 12 dB for K = 4, 15 dB for K
= 8, and 17 dB for K = 12. Roughly speaking, this power gain
increases linearly with K.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we consider efficient transmission over
distributed MIMO channels with I-CSIT. A Hermitian
precoding technique is proposed to exploit the available CSIT.
We show analytically that the proposed Hermitian precoding
technique is optimal for each transmitter under the I-CSIT

assumption when the other transmitters are a priori fixed to
the same precoding structure. Numerical results show that the
proposed Hermitian precoding scheme with I-CSIT suffers
marginal performance loss compared with the system with full
CSIT in various settings. This indicates that the amount of CSI
required at the transmitter sides can be significantly reduced
without considerably compromising the system performance.

where F2 = f2(H2) = V2W2U2H, and G2 = g2(H2) = V2Σ2U2H. The

defined in Section III.C that other transmitters are a priori
fixed to the desired structure, W2 and Σ2Σ2H here are real
diagonal matrices and independent of V2 and U2. Furthermore,
note that H2F2 = U2D2W2U2H and |H2G2|2 = U2D2Σ2Σ2HD2HU2H
are Hermitian, and that U2 is a Haar matrix. From Property 2 in
Section II.B, U1HH2F2U1 and U1H|H2G2|2U1 have the same

where step (a) follows from (26), step (b) follows from the
Jensen’s inequality, and step (c) utilizes (25). Thus, (21) holds
for the case of M = N.
We now discuss the case of M > N. We replace (25) with

is the N-by-N principle submatrix of U lleft with index set {1, …,
N}. The other reasoning literally follows the case of M = N,
except for some minor modifications. The treatment for M < N
is similar. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.

C. Proof of Lemma 3
By definition in (17), Λ1 is Hermitian. This implies that,
any diagonal Λ1 is real-valued. Thus, we only need to consider
W1. We first show that, for any diagonal matrix Λ1 and W1,
ϕ ( Λ1 ,W1 ) = ϕ ( Λ1 ,W1* ) ,

where (·)* represents the conjugate operation.
Since det(A) = det(A*) for any Hermitian matrix A, we have

From Property 2 in Section II.B, (H2F2)* and (I+|F2−1G2|2)*
have the same distribution as H2F2 and I+|F2−1G2|2,
respectively. Thus, we obtain
