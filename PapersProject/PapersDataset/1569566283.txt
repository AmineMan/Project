all the end nodes in Vi get the same rate.
3) There exists at least one path from s to any t ∈ T .

Abstract—This paper shows how to reduce the otherwise hard
joint relay positioning and ﬂow optimization problem into a
sequence a two simpler decoupled problems. We consider a class
of wireless multicast hypergraphs not limited by interference and
are mainly characterized by their hyperarc rate functions, that
are increasing and convex in power, and decreasing in distance
between the transmit node and the farthest end node of the
hyperarc. The set-up consists of a single multicast ﬂow session
involving a source, multiple destinations and a relay that can be
positioned freely. The ﬁrst problem formulates the relay positioning problem in a purely geometric sense, and once the optimal
relay position is obtained the second problem addresses the ﬂow
optimization. Furthermore, simple and efﬁcient algorithms are
presented that solve these problems.

The construction rules capture the distance-based broadcast
approach, e.g. time sharing for broadcasting is a special case
of the above construction rules that is also capacity optimal.
In relation to the special case of our hypergraph model, the
authors addressed the ﬁrst question (of max-ﬂow) in the context of the Low-SNR Broadcast Relay Channel in [1], [2]. This
paper generalizes it in two major directions. First, we solve the
joint relay positioning and max-ﬂow optimization problem for
the hypergraph model characterized above involving a fairly
general class of rate functions and present efﬁcient algorithms
that solve the problem. Second, we address the min-cost ﬂow
problem and establish a duality relation between the max-ﬂow
and min-cost problems in terms of optimal relay positioning
and present an algorithm that solves an important special case
of the min-cost problem.
The relay positioning problem has been studied in various
settings [3]–[5]. In most cases, the problem is either heuristically solved due to inherent complexity, or approximately
solved using simpler methods but compromising accuracy. We
reduce the joint non-convex problem into an easily solvable
sequence of two decoupled problems. The ﬁrst problem solves
for optimal relay position in a purely geometric sense with no
ﬂow optimization involved. Upon obtaining the optimal relay
position the second problem addresses the ﬂow optimization.
Section II develops the wireless network model. Section III
presents the key multicast ﬂow concentration ideas for maxﬂow and min-cost ﬂow that are central to the reducibility of the
joint problem. In Section IV, we present algorithms solving
the problems, and ﬁnally we conclude in Section V.

I. INTRODUCTION
We consider the relay placement problem under a relatively
simple construct of a single multicast session consisting of
a source s, a destination set T and an arbitrarily positionable
relay r, all on a 2-D Euclidean plane. We capture the broadcast
nature of wireless networks but assume no interference for
the multiple access. This is not true in general, but it can be
realized through the multiplexing of time, frequency or code.
Given such a scenario, the problem can be stated as: What
is the optimal relay position that maximizes the multicast ﬂow
from s to T ? Similarly, we can also ask: What is the optimal
relay position that minimizes the cost (in terms of total network
power) for a feasible target multicast ﬂow F ?
A fairly general class of acyclic hypergraphs are considered.
Given a ﬁnite set of nodes N positioned on a 2-D Euclidean
plane the hypergraph G(N , A) is characterized by the following rules of construction of the hyperarcs in the set A:
1) A transmit node i ∈ {s, r} has a radio range and the set
of nodes lying inside it are given by Ti ⊂ T . A hyperarc
(i, Vi ) emanating from i connects to a set of receivers (or
end nodes) Vi ⊂ N \{i} in its radio range.
2) Each hyperarc is associated with a rate function that
is convex and increasing in transmit node power and
decreasing in distance between the transmit node and
the farthest end node of the hyperarc. Each end node
v ∈ Vi spanned by the hyperarc (i, Vi ) can decode the

II. PRELIMINARIES AND MODEL
Consider a hypergraph G(N , A) consisting of |N | nodes
placed on a 2-D Euclidean plane with |A| hyperarcs. The set
N = {s, r, t1 , .., tn } consists of a source node s, a relay r
and an ordered destination set T = {t1 , .., tn } (in increasing
distance from s). The node positions on the 2-D Euclidean
plane are denoted by the set of two-tuple vectors Z = {zi =
(xj , yj )|∀j ∈ N }. The only positionable node is the relay r.

Hypergraph Model that was developed and presented in [1].

A. Low-SNR (Wideband) Broadcast and MAC Channel Model
Consider the AWGN Low-SNR (wideband) Broadcast
Channel with a single source s and multiple destinations
T = {t1 , .., tn }. From [6] and [7], we know that for broadcasting superposition coding is equivalent to time sharing,
and is optimal. Implying that the broadcast communication
from a single source to multiple receivers can be decomposed
into communication over n hyperarcs sharing the common
source power. Therefore, we get the set of hyperarcs Abc =
{(s, t1 ), (s, t1 t2 ), .., (s, t1 t2 ..tn )} (refer Figure 1).
Furthermore, in the Low-SNR (wideband) regime interference becomes negligible with respect to noise, and all
sources can achieve their point-to-point capacities analogous to
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). In general, the
MAC Channel consisting of n sources s1 , ..., sn transmitting
to a common destination t can be interpreted as n point-topoint arcs. Thus, we get Amac = {(s1 , t), .., (sn , t)}. Due
to the linearity of hyperarc capacity in SNR, each hyperarc
(s, t1 ..tj ) ∈ Abc ∪ Amac is associated with the rate function

and the farthest end node vku ∈ Vku from u, respectively.

We assume that the hyperarc rate function Rvku is increasu
ing and convex in power Pvku and decreasing in Duvku .
Furthermore, we write the hyperarc rate function into two
separable functions of power and distance

where g : R+ −→ R+ is increasing and convex and h :

without loss of generality as the results in this paper are valid

for any rate function Rvku = f (Pvku , Duvku ), where f is
increasing and convex in power and decreasing in distance
and in general is not separable and if the inverse function f −1
(mapping the range of f to its domain) exists. Moreover, to
comply with standard physical wireless channel models we
assume that

where tj is the farthest end node of the hyperarc from s, α ≥ 2

B. Low-SNR (Wideband) Achievable Hypergraph Model
By concatenating the Low-SNR Broadcast Channel and
MAC Channel models we obtain an Achievable Hypergraph
Model, for instance the Broadcast Relay Channel consisting
of a single source, n destinations and a relay. Although,
time sharing and FDMA are capacity achieving schemes,
the Achievable Hypergraph Model is not necessarily capacity
achieving. In contrast, it is easy to scale to larger and complex
networks which is practically important.
For simplicity, throughout this paper we will assume that
all the nodes lie in the radio range of s and r for any
arrangement of the nodes N on the plane, and that both
transmitters use time-sharing based broadcasting. As there are
only two transmitters in the system, i.e. s and r, for a given
position of r and assuming (without loss of generality) the
arrangements of node sets {t1 , .., r, .., tn } and {t′ , .., t′ } in
n

increasing order of distance from s and r, respectively, the
sets As = {(s, t1 ), (s, t1 t2 ), .., (s, t1 ..r), .., (s, t1 ..r..tn )} and
Ar = {(r, t′ ), (r, t′ t′ ), .., (s, t′ ..t′ )} of hyperarcs emanating
1
1 2
1 n
from s and r can be constructed easily by the using the
simple construction rules stated in the previous section. Here,
the set {t′ , .., t′ } is simply the destination set T arranged in
n
1
increasing order of distance from r. Consequently, the set of
hyperarcs is given by A = As ∪ Ar (refer Figure 1).
Any hyperarc (u, Vku ) ∈ A is associated with a rate funcu
u
u
tion Rvku = f (Pvku , Duvku ), where Pku and Duvku denotes
the fraction of the total transmit node power allocated for the

u
u
∀(Pvku = Duvku ) ∈ dom(Pvku , Duvku ). Inequality (3)
u
implies that if the variables Pvku and Duvku approach inﬁnity
u
at the same rate, then the rate function Rvu −→ 0. Moreover,
if the functions g and h are not differentiable entirely in
u
dom(Pvku ) and dom(Duvku ), respectively, then Inequality 3
can be rewritten with partial sub-derivatives, which implies
that differentiability is not imperative for the results presented.
Denote the convex hull of the nodes in N \{r} by C. For a
i
i
given relay position zr ∈ C, let Li = {l1 , .., lτi } be the set of
paths from s to a destination ti ∈ T and let L = {l1 , .., lτ }
be the set of paths from s that span all the destination set T ,
therefore L ⊂ i∈[1,n] Li . Moreover, any path in the system
consists of either a single hyperarc or at most two hyperarcs
as there are only two transmitters in the system and G(N , A)
is acyclic. Let µ and ν denote the total given power of the
ν
source and relay, respectively, and γ = µ denote their ratio,
i
where γ ∈ (0, ∞). Denote with Flj and Fi the ﬂow over the
i
path lj (for j ∈ [1, τi ]) and the total ﬂow to the destination

ti ∈ T , respectively, such that Fi = j∈[1,τi ] Flj . Deﬁne F to
be the the multicast ﬂow from s to the destination set T as the
minimum among the total ﬂows to each destination, then for
a given relay position zr ∈ C the multicast max-ﬂow problem
can be written as,

F = min Fi

III. M ULTICAST F LOW P ROPERTIES A ND R EDUCTION
In this section we develop fundamental multicast ﬂow properties that govern the multicast ﬂow in the wireless network
hypergraphs that we consider in this paper. First, we brieﬂy
note the main hurdles in jointly optimizing the problem. For
a given problem instance different relay positions can result
in different hypergraphs, which makes the use of standard
graph-based ﬂow optimization algorithms difﬁcult. Moreover,
the hyperarc rate function can be non-convex.
We will show that the joint problems (s, T, Z, γ) and
(s, T, Z, γ, F ) can be reduced to solving a sequence of two
decoupled problems. The reduced problems are decoupled
in the sense that the ﬁrst problem is purely a geometric
optimization problem and involves no ﬂow optimization and
vice versa for the second problem. At the same time, they are
not entirely decoupled because the two problems cannot be
solved separately. Now we present a series of results that are
fundamental to the reducibility of the joint problem.

∗
Proposition 1: The optimal relay positions zγ↑ and zF ↓ lie
inside the convex hull C.
Refer to Appendix A in [8] for the proof. Proposition 1
tells us that only the points inside the polygon C need to be
considered. This brings us to the next fundamental theorem.
Theorem 1 (Flow Concentration): Given the problem instance (s, T, Z) and zr ∈ C:

The hyperarc rate constraints and node sum-power constraints
are denoted by the set C(P, D) in Program (A) for simplicity.
Program (A) in general is non-convex.
Now, let us deﬁne the notion of cost for a given hyperarc

rate Rvku = h(Duv u ) ≥ 0. The cost of rate Rvku is given by
ku

the total power consumed by the hyperarc to achieve Rvku

u
u
Pvku = g −1 Rvku h(Duvku ) ,

(6)

where g −1 : R+ −→ R+ is the inverse function of g that maps
its range to its domain. Therefore, the total cost of multicast
ﬂow F is simply the sum of powers of all the hypearcs in the
system. Note that the function g −1 is increasing and concave,
and if h is convex then from Inequality (3) g −1 ◦ h increasing
and convex. So for a given relay position zr ∈ C, the min-cost
problem minimizing the total cost for setting up the multicast
session (s, T ) with a target ﬂow F can be written as,

(i) the maximized multicast ﬂow F ∗ concentrates over at
most two paths from s to the destination set T .
(ii) for any target ﬂow F ∈ [0, F ∗ ] the min-cost multicast
ﬂow concentrates over at most two paths from s to T .

(B)

The proof of Theorem 1 is detailed in Appendix B of [8].
Essentially, Theorem 1 tells that for a given relay position
zr ∈ C, the multicast ﬂow F goes only over the paths that
span all the destination set T , i.e. set L. Furthermore, among
the paths in L, the maximized multicast ﬂow F ∗ goes over
only two paths, namely the path L ∋ ˆ1 = {(s, T1 ), (r, T2 )}
l
that has the highest min-cut among all the paths through the
relay r, and path L ∋ ˆ2 = {(s, t1 , .., tn ) = (s, T )}, which is
l
the biggest hyperarc from s spanning all the destination set T ,
here r ∈ T1 and T1 ∪ T2 = T . The same holds for the mincost case for a given relay position zr ∈ C. Consequently,
∗
∗
it is also true for the optimal relay positions zγ↑ and zF ↓ .
Hereafter, we only need to consider the ﬂow over paths ˆ1 and
l
ˆ2 (corresponding to the relay position in consideration).

Constraint (7) makes sure that any destination ti ∈ T receives
a minimum of ﬂow F . Like in Program (A), we denote with
the set C(P, D) the hyperarc rate and power constraints.
Finally, deﬁne the point p∗ , that will be crucial in developing
algorithms in later sections,
zp∗ = arg min(max(ν ∗ h(Dzp s ), µ∗ max(h(Dzp ti )))),

where, µ∗ = g(µ) and ν ∗ = g(ν). An intuitive way to
understand p∗ is that if µ∗ = ν ∗ = 1 then p∗ is the
circumcenter of two or more nodes in the set N \{r}. Note that
the program in Equation (9) is a convex program, and ﬁnally
Dp∗ denotes the optimal value of the objective function.
Hereafter, we represent with (s, T, Z, γ) and (s, T, Z, γ, F )
the joint relay positioning and ﬂow optimization problem
instances that maximizes the multicast ﬂow and minimizes
∗
∗
the total cost for a the target ﬂow F , and with zγ↑ and zF ↓
denote the optimal relay positions, respectively. Note that the
∗
optimal relay position zγ↑ is characterized by the power ratio
∗
γ and the optimal relay position zF ↓ is characterized by the
target ﬂow F .

the path ˆ1 = {(s, T1 ), (r, T2 )} by circles CT1 and CT2 cenl
tered at s and r with radii πs = Dstk and πr = Drtk′ (where

the hyperarc Cπs to Cr , else we simply re-denote it with

γ ∈ (0, ∞). Figure 2(a) captures this interesting insight of the

relationship between the points r and zγ↑ . Note that the set R
of points r is a discontinuous piecewise linear segment.

zr ∈ C such that zr ∈ CT1 and Z ∈ C∪ . Although Program
(C) is substantially reduced using Theorem 1, it is still a nonconvex optimization problem. The objective function is nonconvex and different positions of the relay zr ∈ C result in
different end node sets T1 and T2 for the hyperarcs of path lˆ .
1
On the other hand, we know that the relay position is
sensitive only to the ﬂow over path ˆ1 . Therefore, the optimal
l
relay position maximizing the ﬂow only over the path ˆ1
l
results in global optimal relay position solving (s, T, Z, γ).
This fact combined with the independent power constraints
for the ﬂow over the path ˆ1 motivates the decoupling optimal
l
relay position from the ﬂow maximization.
Proposition 2: For a given problem instance (s, T, Z, γ), if
for a close enough point pǫ on the perpendicular bisector ⊥jn

to p∗ the following holds Rpǫ < Rp∗ , then zγ↑ = zp∗ .
Refer to Appendix C in [8] for the detailed proof. ⊥jn denotes the perpendicular bisector of the points tj and tn , where
tj is the farthest node in T from tn . At point p∗ , in general
the following holds g(µ) ≥ g(ν) (from Equation (9)), thus
p∗

making it naturally a good candidate for zγ↑ . Proposition 2,
∗
shows that the point p is essentially a good lower bound

on the maximized multicast rate Rp∗ ≤ R∗ . In addition, if
positioning the relay close enough to p∗ at point pǫ (in the
direction closer to the source s) on the perpendicular bisector
∗
∗
⊥jn decreases the maximized multicast rate, i.e. Rpǫ < Rp∗ ,
∗
then it can be proven that zγ↑ = zp∗ . The general case is
covered in the next section.
Let us now see the problem in a different way. Consider
s
πs ∈ (0, Dstn ) and construct the hyperarc Cπs . Denote by
′
T = {tj ∈ T |Dstj > πs }, the set of destination nodes that
s
lie outside the hyperarc circle Cπs . Then compute r such that

Here, F ∈ [0, F ∗ ]. From Theorem 1, we know that paths
ˆ1 and ˆ2 carry all the min-cost target multicast ﬂow F . For

convenience, we will refer the path ˆ1 as the cheapest path
l
for a unit ﬂow among all the paths through r in L for given

Otherwise, we can position the relay at the point zr ∈ CT1
solving the right hand side of Equation (12), further reducing
the total cost for the target ﬂow F contradicting the optimality

of zF ↓ . Therefore, zF ↓ (like zγ↑ ) always lie on on the curve
R. This observation motivates an interesting fundamental
∗
∗
relationship between zF ↓ and zγ↑ .

zF ↓ = zγ↑ ,

Theorem 2 establishes the underlying duality relation between the max-ﬂow and min-cost problem in terms of optimal
∗
relay position. Implying that the optimal relay position zF ↓
solving the problem (s, T, Z, γ, F ) is also the optimal relay
∗
position zγ↑ solving the problem (s, T, Z, γ) for some γ. The
proof of Theorem 2 is presented in Appendix D of [8].
On the other hand, the min-cost problem (s, T, Z, γ, F ) is
not always reducible to a sequence of decoupled problems.
This is beacause the path ˆ2 can be cheaper than path ˆ1 for a

V. CONCLUSION
We analyze and solve the optimal relay positioning problem
for a fairly general class of Broadcast Relay Hypergraphs
characterized by rate functions that are increasing and convex
in power, and decreasing in distance. We reduce the hard joint
relay positioning and ﬂow (max-ﬂow/min-cost) optimization
problem to a sequence of simple decoupled problems.
As a part of future work it would be of interest to extend
the work presented here to the general multicommodity setting
where multiple sessions use a set of relays.

Max-ﬂow Algorithm.

The Max-ﬂow Algorithm in Figure 3 is a simple 3 step
(non-iterative) algorithm that outputs the optimal relay position
and the maximized multicast ﬂow. The ﬁrst step is essentially
Proposition 2, if it does not hold the second step ﬁlters the
redundant nodes that are too close to the source and can be
ignored. If the ﬁrst and second step are not satisﬁed, then the
∗
third step divides the computation of zγ↑ into two regions of C
and outputs the better one. The proof of optimality is provided
in Appendix E of [8].

B. Min-cost Algorithm
We present the Min-cost Algorithm for a special case of
(s, T, Z, γ, F ), that is when the Inequality (14) holds and at
∗
the optimal relay position zF ↓ all the target ﬂow goes over path
ˆ1 . This special case corresponds to satisfying Proposition 2
l
for the Max-ﬂow problem. Min-cost Algorithm in Figure 4,
unlike the Max-ﬂow algorithm, is an iterative algorithm. In the
ﬁrst step the geometric feasibility region is constructed and in
the second step this region is divided into at most n − 1 subregions. Refer Appendix F of [8] for the proof of optimality.
