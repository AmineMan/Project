Abstract—We analyze properties of Constant Markov Portfolio
(CMP), which we proposed as a generalized notion of Constantly
Rebalanced Portfolio (CRP) in 2011, and present its generalization. In particular, we show the algorithm for exact computation
of the Bayesian strategy for CMP by extending the algorithm
for CRP given by Cover & Ordentlich in 1996. Further, we
propose a generalization of CMP in order to design a strategy
which employs the option of cash as side information. We show
an efﬁcient approximation algorithm to compute the universal
strategy for the model based on EM algorithm.

the information of cash. Since the usual universal portfolio
is determined based on ratios between the price relatives of
stocks in a market. That is, cash’s price can be used as side
information. For this problem, we utilize the GCMP since
simple application of CMP in our problem does not work
well. It is due to the fact that each hidden state represents
that the correspondent stock is most promising, i.e. each state
is tied up with a particular stock. This fairly restricts freedom
of the state transition map of the underlying Markov model.
This can be solved by employing the GCMP in which the
states are deﬁned independently of the set of stocks. By this
extension, the GCMP can provide a chance to obtain a better
portfolio than the CMP. We show that the GCMP with side
information work well in some simulations.
As precedent research of universal portfolio with side
information, Cover[4], Cross & Barron[7] and Fujita &
Kawabata[8], etc. are known. In Cross & Barron[7], an upper
bound on wealth ratio O(nd ) is shown, where d is the
dimension of the target class.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review
universal portfolios[3] and CMP[12]. In Section III, we present
an exact computation algorithm of Bayes strategy for CMP.
We introduce GCMP in Section IV and propose a method
of universal portfolio with side information using GCMP
in Section V. Further, we show an efﬁcient approximation
algorithm for our method and the results of some experiments
in Section VI.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We discuss properties of Constant Markov Portfolio (CMP)
introduced in [12] and propose a method of universal portfolio with side information using CMP. It is an extension of
constantly rebalanced portfolio (CRP) in universal portfolio
introduced by Cover[3]. It is a certain type of hidden Markov
model and allows time dependency in stock’s price data. We
showed that the minimax log wealth ratio of the CMP equals
the minimax coding regret of the underlying Markov model in
CMP [12], and proposed an efﬁcient approximation algorithm
of universal strategy for CMP using Baum-Welch algorithm.
Portfolio theory has been studied in several ﬁelds, such as ﬁnance, Bayes theory, game theory, information theory, etc. Related to information theory, Cover[3], Cover & Ordentlich[4],
Cross & Barron[7], etc. have studied this topic. Cover introduced a model of portfolio referred to as universal portfolio. It
has the similar formulation as universal data compression with
coding regret[9], [11], [14]. Cover and Ordentlich [4] gave
the minimax wealth ratio and the minimax strategy for the
problem, where they assumed the class of portfolios referred
to as constantly rebalanced portfolios (CRP).
As the ﬁrst result of our study on property of the CMP, we
show an exact computation algorithm of the portfolio of Bayes
strategy with Dirichlet prior for CMP, which is an extension of
the similar algorithm for CRP [4]. Then we provide a further
generalized notion of CMP, which we name Generalized CMP
(GCMP), taking advantage of our understanding that CMP and
CRP are hidden Markov models.
As an application of CMP, we study the problem of universal portfolio with side information, and propose a strategy
which utilizes price relatives themselves by adding the option
of cash as the an additional stock. This modiﬁcation of
universal portfolio has been considered in several literatures
[4], [7], [8]. However we consider the different problem in
which the investors don’t invest in cash, they just utilize

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Universal Portfolios (Cover [6])
Let us consider a stock market which consists of m stocks.
Describe the market by series of m-dimensional vectors {xi },
where jth element xij of xi denotes the price relative of jth
stock. The price relative xij is a ratio of jth stock’s price at
the end of the ith day to that at the beginning of the day.
The investor’s strategy (portfolio) is speciﬁed by a portfolio
vector, which is a non-negative valued vector b normalized as
m
m
, bj ≥
j=1 bj = 1. Let B denote the class B = {b ∈
m
0, j=1 bj = 1}. The portfolio vector’s jth element denotes
a fraction of the capital invested in the jth stock to the whole
capital invested in all m stocks. Then, b·xi denotes the growth
rate of the whole capital (wealth relative) at the ith day.
n
Deﬁne a series of functions Sn (xn |b) = i=1 b · xi , then
it denotes the wealth the investor has at the nth day, provided
that he had the wealth of the amount 1 at the beginning of the
1st day, and that he dealt everyday so as to keep his portfolio

as b. This strategy is referred to as constantly rebalanced
portfolio (CRP). If he knew the behaviour of the stock market
xn in advance, he could optimize b so that Sn (xn |b) was
ˆ
maximized. Let b denote the optimal value of b given xn .
ˆ is referred to as optimal constantly rebalanced
The portfolio b
ˆ
portfolio. However, to ﬁnd b in advance is impossible.
The goal of universal portfolio is to approach the optimal
constantly rebalanced portfolio without the knowledge about
xn . The real portfolio should be determined by the past
observations. Such a portfolio strategy is referred to as causal
portfolio, which is a series of portfolio vectors {β(xi )}, where
β(xi ) is the portfolio for the i + 1th day and is determined
based on the past observations xi = x1 · · · xi .
Cover considered the minimax problem for the following
wealth ratio:

If we consider the special case that the model of p(y n |θ)
is Bernoulli, then CRP is induced as the wealth density. Here,

these expressions show that Sn (xn |β) is a model with latent
n
variables y . When q is a probability mass function of the
Bernoulli or the Markov chains, (7) can be interpreted as an
hidden Markov model (HMM).
Note that Cover’s minimax strategy for CRP can be approximated by the Bayes strategy using the Jeffreys prior. The
minimax strategy is given as

where we let Sn (xn |β) = i=1 β(xi−1 ) · xi , which is the
wealth growth rate by {β(xi )}.
B. Stochastic Interpretation of Portfolios
Here, we review the stochastic interpretation of universal
portfolios [12], i.e. we review the notion of wealth density.
The range of each element of the stock market vector xi
is [0, ∞). Recall that we concern the wealth ratio which
remains unchanged even if we multiply xi in both numerator
and denominator by a common constant. Hence, for the
problem of universal portfolio in which xi ’s are normalized
m
as j=1 xij = 1, the wealth ratio is the same one as for the
original problem. Hence, we can restrict the range of the price
m
relatives to the set Tm = {x ∈ m , xj ≥ 0, j=1 xj = 1}.
Deﬁne the probability density functions of portfolios by normalizing wealth growth rate function as the integration with
Tm is 1, that is, we have

S(x|b) = m!S(x|b) = m! b · x.

Parametric Portfolios

Constant Markov Portfolio

We review the notation of the parametric portfolio [12]. We
deﬁne a parametric model of densities of y n , G = {p(·|θ) :
θ ∈ Θ}, where Θ is the parameter space of m dimensions.
Note that there exists a series β θ (xi−1 ) such that the following
holds for any xn ∈ Tm n

In [12], we introduced a new target class of universal portfolio named constant Markov portfolios (CMP) by assuming
that G is the class of the ﬁxed order Markov chains. Here, we
review it for the case of the ﬁrst order Markov chain. Let ηy|s
denote the conditional probability that y ∈ Y succeeds after
s ∈ Y, i.e. we assume that y∈Y ηy|s = 1 and ηy|s ≥ 0. For
each s ∈ Y, let η s denote the vector (η1|s , · · · , ηm|s )T and η
the vector (η T , η T , · · · , η T ). Let p(y n |y0 , η) = p(y n |η) (y0 is

applying the Baum-Welch algorithm (See [1] for example).
κ(x|y, a) = m!(ay1 x1 + · · · + aym xm ) (1 ≤ y ≤ ms ).
For evaluation of this method, see [13].

V. T HE S TRATEGY WITH S IDE I NFORMATION
In this section, we present a strategy which utilizes the side
information by adding the option of cash as the m+1th stock.
Hereafter, we assume m = 2 and treat the GCMP of ms = 2.
As mentioned before, the usual model of universal portfolio
uses the ratio of each stock’s price relative only.
However, there is a possibility that strategies depending on
the stock’s price itself performs better. Therefore, we consider
a new strategy by adding cash option as a side information to
GCMP, because the ratio between the price of each stock and
cash includes the information of stock’s price relative itself.
We show the concrete idea of our new strategy below.
Let x denote the price relative vector consisting of two
stocks and cash, assuming x3 denotes the price relative of cash.
Though x3 = 1 in the usual setting, x3 is less than or equals
1 in our setting, because we normalize x as x1 + x2 + x3 = 1.
˜
Let x denote (x1 , x2 )/(x1 + x2 ), and deﬁne s = x3 . We call
s side information. Note that x = ((1 − s)˜1 , (1 − s)˜2 , s).
x
x
¯
Here, let x denote the price relative vector of two stocks
¯
¯
which is not normalized. When xi = (1, 1/2) and xi+1 =
(2, 1), then x = (2/3, 1/3) for both cases, which doesn’t
˜
contain price information itself.
¯
If we let x denote the price relative vector consisting of two
¯
stocks and cash which is not normalized, then xi = (1, 1/2, 1)
¯
and xi+1 = (2, 1, 1) for the above example. Then we have
xi = (2/5, 1/5, 2/5) and xi+1 = (1/2, 1/4, 1/4), which
conserve the price information. By this, x with small (large)
x3 can represent that the business is good (bad). Here, we
consider the problem that when the business is good (bad),
the price of ﬁrst (second) stock is likely to be large (small).
However, this situation cannot be represented by the model of
CMP, because the state transition map is fairly restricted as
mentioned in Introduction.

Simulations
In this section, we compare the performance of universal
strategies and optimal ones of the GCMP with side information
and the original CMP for a certain synthetic data.
We generated the synthetic data as follows. The latent
variable y is generated by the Markov model which has
the parameters (η1|2 , η2|1 ) = (0.05, 0.05). We deﬁne the
random variables z and w as, z ∼ N (0.5 − , γ · 2 ),
w ∼ N (0.5+ , γ · 2 ), where determines the form of the two
Gaussians. When the state y is 1, let x3 ∼ N (0.2, 0.01), and
z

x = (1 − x3 ) · z+w , (1 − x3 ) · z+w , x3 . When the state y is
2, let x3 ∼ N (0.8, 0.01), and x = (1 − x3 ) ·

w
z+w , (1 − x3 ) ·

. For GCMP, the strategy is determined by x , while
it is determined by x for CMP. Recall that the wealth density
˜
for GCMP is given by (16). On the other hand, for CMP,
˜
we created the data x. We can expect that the performance of
GCMP is better than that of CMP when is small, because the
˜
states cannot be easily distinguished based on only x. Here,
