condition of IA problems using algebraic geometry [3]–[6]. In
[3], the authors studied the feasibility condition of IA problem
in single stream MIMO interference. This work has been
extended to the multiple stream case by two parallel works
[4], and [6], respectively. The two works have proposed some
necessary conditions for MIMO interference networks with
general conﬁguration, but the proposed sufﬁcient conditions
are limited to speciﬁc conﬁgurations.
In this paper, we develop new tool in algebraic geometry
which allows us to address the IA feasibility issue in the
general conﬁguration. The newly developed tool maps the
solvability of a set of general polynomial equations to the
linear independence of their ﬁrst order terms. Based on
this new tool, we can extend our understanding on the IA
feasibility conditions in the following aspects:
A. Further tighten the IA feasibility conditions from the
necessary side;
B. Propose and prove a sufﬁcient condition of IA feasibility which applies to MIMO interference networks with
general conﬁgurations;
C. Determine the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions of IA
feasibility in a wider range of network conﬁgurations
comparing with the results given in [4]–[6].
Fig. 1 compares and contrasts the new results established
in this paper with all previous results on the IA feasibility
conditions for MIMO interference networks.

Abstract—Attributed by its breakthrough performance in interference networks, interference alignment (IA) has attracted
great attention in the last few years. However, despite the
tremendous works dedicated to IA, the feasibility conditions of IA
processing remains unclear for most network typologies. The IA
feasibility analysis is challenging as the IA constraints are sets of
high-degree polynomials, for which no systematic tool to analyze
the solvability conditions exists. In this work, by developing a
new mathematical framework that maps the solvability of sets
of polynomial equations to the linear independence of their ﬁrstorder terms, we propose a sufﬁcient condition that applies to
K-pairs MIMO interference networks with general typologies.
We have further proved that the sufﬁcient condition aligns with
the necessary conditions under some special conﬁgurations.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Interference has been a fundamental performance bottleneck
in wireless communication. Conventional schemes either treat
interference as noise or use channel orthogonalization to avoid
interference. However, these schemes are non-capacity achieving in general. Interference alignment (IA), ﬁrst proposed in
[1], signiﬁcantly improves the performance of interference
networks by aligning the aggregated interference from multiple
sources into a lower dimensional subspace. For instance, in
a system with K transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) pairs and N
antennas at each node, the IA processing achieves throughput
(
)
which scales on O KN log(SNR) [2]. This scaling law is
2
optimal and well dominates that of conventional orthogonalization schemes, i.e. O (N log(SNR)). As such, there is a
surge in the research interests of IA.
To achieve the optimal scaling law of throughput, the IA
2
2
solution in [2] requires O((KN )2K N ) dimensions of signal
space, which is realized by time or frequency domain symbol
extension. Such symbol extension approach is not scalable
and is difﬁcult to implement in practice due to the huge
dimensions of the signal space involved. To overcome this
problem, IA designs with signal space dimension limited by
the number of antennas, are proposed for practical MIMO
systems. When the signal space dimension is limited, the IA
is not always feasible. Therefore, the characterization of the
feasibility conditions under limited signal space dimension
is the primary issue to address. In general, the feasibility
of the IA problem is associated with the solvability of a
set of polynomial equations, which is the focus of algebraic
geometry. There are very few works that studied the feasibility

Remark 3.2 (Interpretation of the Sufﬁcient Condition):
Vectors deﬁned in (8) are in fact the coefﬁcients of the linear
terms of polynomials in the IA constraint (3). Please refer to
(12), (13) for details. Hence, Thm. 3.2 claims that the linear
independence of these coefﬁcient vectors is sufﬁcient for the
IA problem to be feasible. This fact is a direct consequence
of the mathematical tool we developed in algebraic geometry,
i.e. Lem. 3.1-3.3. Please refer to Fig. 2 for an intuitive
illustration of this mathematical tool.

Corollary 3.1 (The Symmetric Case): When the network
conﬁguration χ is symmetric, i.e. dk = d, Mk = M , Nk = N ,
∀k ∈ {1, ..., K}, and min(M, N ) ≥ 2d, Problem 2.1 has
solution almost surely if and only if the following inequality
is true.

A. MIMO Interference Networks with General Conﬁguration
The following two theorems summarize the main result on
the necessary side and the sufﬁcient side, respectively.
Theorem 3.1 (Necessary Conditions for IA Feasibility): If
Problem 2.1 has solution, then the network conﬁguration χ
must satisfy the following inequalities:

Remark 3.1 (Tighter Necessary Conditions): (5) is the
newly proposed necessary condition. In fact, if the cardinality
of set Jsub is restricted to be 1, we have that (5) is reduced
to
max(Mj , Nk ) ≥ dk + dj , ∀j ̸= k,

Remark 3.3 (Backward Compatible to [4]): If we further
assume that M = N , the feasibility conditions in Cor. 3.1
is reduced to 2N − (K + 1)d ≥ 0, which is consistent with
the IA feasibility conditions given in [4].
Corollary 3.2 (“Divisible” Case): When the network conﬁguration χ satisﬁes 1) dk = d, ∀k, and 2) d|Nk , ∀k or d|Mk ,
∀k, Problem 2.1 has solution almost surely if and only if the

Remark 3.4 (Backward Compatible to [3], [5], and [6]):
If we further assume that d = 1, then d|Nk for all Nk ∈ N.
In this case, Cor. 3.2 aligns with the feasibility conditions
obtained in [3]. Similarly, if we require both Nk and Mk are
divisible by d, Cor. 3.2 is reduced to the feasibility conditions
given by [5], [6].

construct a new systematic tool that links linear independence

developed tool is not only the key steps to handle the IA
feasibility issue in this work, but is also a good candidate of
handling the solvability issue of sets of polynomial equations
in general.

i ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} are linearly independent, then we have fi ,
i ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} are algebraically independent.
Proof: Please refer to Appendix-A for the proof.
Lemma 3.2: Algebraic Independence is Invariant up to a
Constant: Suppose K is an algebraically closed ﬁeld. If polynomials fi ∈ K[x1 , x2 , ...xk ], i ∈ {1, ..., L} are algebraically
independent, and ci are independent random variables drawn
from continuous distribution in K. Then gi = ci + fi are
algebraically independent almost surely.
Proof: Please refer to Appendix-B for the proof.
Finally, we have the following lemmas which show that
algebraic independence leads to non-empty solution set of a
set of polynomials.

Vanishing Set: Suppose K is a algebraically closed ﬁeld. If

Substitute (12) to Lem. 3.4 and Lem. 3.1∼3.3 sequentially,
we can prove that Problem 2.1 has solution almost surely if
vectors {wkjpq } deﬁned by (8) are linearly independent.
Next, we show that for a given network conﬁguration
χ, vectors {wkjpq } are either always linearly dependent or
linearly independent almost surely.

if at least one of the C × C sub-matrices of W has nonzero determinant. Therefore, the statement is proved if the
following proposition holds:
Proposition 1: Under a network conﬁguration χ, the determinant of a C ×C sub-matrix of W is either always zero or
non-zero almost surely.

To prove Prop. 1, we ﬁrst have the following lemma:
Lemma 3.5: Suppose x1 , ..., xk ∈ C are independent random variables drawn from continuous distribution, f is a nonconstant polynomial ∈ C[x1 , ..., xk ]. Then f ̸= 0 almost
surely.
Proof: When k = 1, from the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra [7], f (x1 ) = 0 only has ﬁnite number of solutions.
On the other hand, x1 is drawn from continues distribution.
Hence f (x1 ) ̸= 0 almost surely.
For k ≥ 2, the lemma can be proved by using mathematical
induction w.r.t. k. We omit the details for conciseness.
From (8) and the Leibniz formula, the determinant of a
C × C sub-matrix of W can be written as a polynomial
f ∈ C(hkj (p, q)) with no constant term, where k ̸= j ∈
{1, ..., K}, p ∈ {1, ..., Nk }, q ∈ {1, ..., Mj }. Further note that
the coefﬁcients of f is determined by the conﬁguration of
the network χ. Hence, under a ceratin χ, f is either a zero
polynomial or a non-constant polynomial. In the latter case,
by applying Lem. 3.5, we have that f ̸= 0 almost surely. This
completes the proof.
2) Proof of Corollary 3.1 and Corollary 3.2: We will
highlight a key lemma in proving both corollaries. Please refer
to the full paper for the other details of the proofs.
Lemma 3.6 (Sufﬁcient Conditions for IA Feasibility): If
there exists a set of binary variables {ct , cr
kjpq kjpq ∈ {0, 1}},
k, j ∈ {1, ..., K}, k ̸= j, p ∈ {1, ..., dk }, q ∈ {1, ..., dj } that

(19)

Note that the coefﬁcient vectors wi are linearly independent,

Therefore, {y1 , ..., yM } ∼ {x1 , ..., xM } = KM . Hence, from

(19), we have that V(p1 ) = {y1 , ..., yM } ∼ KM , which means
=
p1 must be a zero polynomial.
Similarly, when p1 is a zero polynomial, by analyzing
the coefﬁcients of the second order terms, we have that
V(p2 ) ∼ KM and therefore p2 is also a zero polynomial. By

B. Proof of Lemma 3.2
We ﬁrst prove that g1 , f2 , ..., fL are algebraically independent. Then the Lemma can be proved by repeating the same
trick L times. We use contradiction to prove the statement.

However, p′ (f1 , f2 , ..., fL ) = 0, which contradicts with the
assumption that f1 , ..., fL are algebraically independent.

A PPENDICES
A. Proof of Lemma 3.1
When vectors {wi } are linearly independent, we have that
L ≤ M . Note that if the lemma holds when L = M , it
must hold for all L ∈ {1, ..., M }. Hence we only need to
consider the case in which L = M . We use contradiction
to prove the statement. Suppose fi , i ∈ {1, 2, ..., L} are
algebraically dependent. Then from the deﬁnition, there must
exist a nonzero polynomial p, such that p(f1 , f2 , ..., fM ) = 0.
Without loss of generality, denote p = p0 + p1 + ...pD , where
pd contains all the d-th degree terms in p, D ∈ N. Then we

C. Proof of Lemma 3.3
Since {fi } are algebraically independent, from [8, Thm.0.4,
Lecture 2], K[f1 , ..., fL ] ∼ K[y1 , ..., yL ]. Hence, ⟨f1 , ..., fL ⟩ ∼
=
=
⟨y1 , ..., yL ⟩, where ⟨z1 , ..., zL ⟩ denotes the ideal generated by
z1 , ..., zL . Note that ideal ⟨z1 , ..., zL ⟩ is proper, i.e. does not
contain 1, so is ideal ⟨f1 , ..., fL ⟩. Therefore, from Hilbert’s
Nullstellensatz Theorem [9, Thm. 3.1, Chap. I], V(f1 , ...fL )
is non-empty.

D. Proof of Lemma 3.6
Due to page limit, we will illustrate the outline of the proof
via an example. Please refer to the full paper for the rigorous

Consider a 3-pairs MIMO interference network whose conﬁguration χ is illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 also shows that
there exists a set of binary variables {ct , cr } that satisﬁes

appears in both w1311 and w1312 . This repetitive appearance
of a same element adds to the difﬁculty of the proof. On the
t
other hand, since ct
1311 = c1312 = 1, we have that h13 (1, 3)
appears in only W22 . More generally, from condition (17),
if an element hkj (p, q) appears in W22 , it will not appear in
other sub-matrices of W. Hence, as illustrated by Label G in
Fig. 4, W22 is independent of W11 , W12 , W21 . From the
Leibniz formula, we have:
(
)
det(W) = det(W11 ) det W22 − W21 W−1 W12
(22)

In the following analysis, we will utilize the properties of
{ct , cr } to show that:
kjpq kjpq
Proposition 2: Vectors {wjkpq } are linearly independent
almost surly.
If Prop. 2 is true in the network illustrated by Fig. 3, from
Thm. 3.2, the example network is IA feasible almost surely.
As illustrated by Fig. 4, consider matrix W, which is
aggregated by vectors {wjkpq }. Note that under this network
˜ ˜
conﬁguration, we have 10 polynomials in (12) and {Uk , Vj }
have 10 elements in total, W is a 10 × 10 matrices. Hence,
prove Prop. 2, we only need to show that W is nonsingular,
i.e. det W ̸= 0 almost surely.
The major properties of W that lead to the nonsingular
property are illustrated by Labels D, E, and F. We ﬁrst
carefully arrange the order of vectors {wkjpq }. In particular,
t
index sequences (k, j, p, q) that satisfy cr
kjpq = 1 or ckjpq = 1
are placed in the upper and lower part of W, respectively.
Then as illustrated by Label C, we can partition W into four
sub-matrices W11 , W12 , W21 , and W22 . W11 and W22 are
block-diagonal as we have ordered the rows in W according to
the constraint allocation policy {ct , cr }. In this example,
kjpq kjpq
the “=” sign always holds in (15), (16). Consequently, as
highlighted by Label F, all the diagonal blocks of W11 , W22
are square matrices. Further note that the elements in a same
diagonal block are independent of each other, all the diagonal
blocks of W11 , W22 are full rank almost surely. Thus we
have W11 , W22 are nonsingular almost surely, i.e.
det W11 ̸= 0, det W22 ̸= 0, almost surely.

Note that W22 is independent of W21 W−1 W12 . Substi11
tuting (21) into (22), we have that det(W) ̸= 0 holds almost
surely. This completes the proof for the example network.
