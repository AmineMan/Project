Abstract—In this paper we investigate repeated root cyclic and
negacyclic codes of length 𝑝 𝑟 𝑚 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 with (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. In the
case 𝑝 odd, we give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the
existence of negacyclic self-dual codes. When 𝑚 = 2𝑚′ with
𝑚′ odd, we characterize the codes in terms of their generator
polynomials. This provides simple conditions on the existence of
self-dual negacyclic codes, and generalizes the results of Dinh [6].
We also answer an open problem concerning the number of selfdual cyclic codes given by Jia et al. [11].

II. S ELF - DUAL N EGACYCLIC C ODES OF L ENGTH 𝑚𝑝 𝑟
OVER 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠

I. I NTRODUCTION

Throughout this section, 𝑝 is an odd prime number and 𝑛 =
𝑚𝑝 𝑟 , with 𝑚 an integer (odd or even) such that (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1.
This section provides conditions on the existence of self-dual
negacyclic codes of length 𝑛 = 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . It is well known
that negacyclic codes over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 are principal ideals generated
𝑟
by the factors of 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 + 1. Since 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 has characteristic 𝑝, the
𝑟
polynomial 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 + 1 can be factored as

Let 𝑝 be a prime number and 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 the ﬁnite ﬁeld with
𝑠
𝑝 elements. An [𝑛, 𝑘] linear code 𝐶 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 is a 𝑘dimensional subspace of 𝔽 𝑝𝑛 𝑠 . A linear code 𝐶 over 𝔽 𝑝𝑛 𝑠 is
said to be constacyclic if it is an ideal of the quotient ring
𝑅 𝑛 = 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥]/⟨𝑥 𝑛 − 𝑎⟩. When 𝑎 = 1 the code is called
cyclic, and when 𝑎 = −1 the code is called negacyclic. The
Euclidean dual code 𝐶 ⊥ of 𝐶 is deﬁned as 𝐶 ⊥ = {x ∈
∑𝑛
𝔽 𝑞𝑛 :
𝑖=1 𝑥 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 = 0 ∀ y ∈ 𝐶}. An interesting class of codes
is the so-called self-dual codes. A code is called Euclidean
self-dual if it satisﬁes 𝐶 = 𝐶 ⊥ . Note that the dual of a
cyclic (respectively negacyclic) code is a cyclic (respectively
negacyclic) code.
Cyclic codes are interesting from both theoretical and practical perspectives. For example, they can easily be encoded, and
decoding algorithms exist in many cases. When (𝑛, 𝑝) = 1,
these codes are called simple root codes, otherwise they are
called repeated root codes. Castagnoli et al. and van Lint [4],
[12] studied repeated root cyclic codes. They proved that these
codes have a concatenated structure and are not asymptotically better than simple root codes. Negacyclic codes were
introduced by Berlekamp [2]. Simple root self-dual negacyclic
codes were studied by Blackford [3] and Guenda [8]. The
algebraic structure of repeated root constacyclic codes of
length 2𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 as well as the self-duality of such codes
has also been investigated by Dinh [6]. Conditions on the
existence of cyclic self-dual codes of length 2 𝑟 𝑚 over 𝔽2 𝑠
were studied independently by Kai and Zhu [10] and Jia et
al. [11]. Jia et al. also determined the existence and the number
of cyclic self-dual codes for 𝑞 = 2 𝑚 .
In this paper, we investigate repeated root cyclic and negacyclic codes of length 𝑝 𝑟 𝑚 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 with (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. When
𝑝 is odd, we give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the

𝐴(𝑥) =

where 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥), 𝑖 ≤ 𝑙, are the polynomials given in (2) and 0 ≤

For a polynomial 𝑓 (𝑥) = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1 𝑥 . . . + 𝑎 𝑟 𝑥 𝑟 , with 𝑎0 ∕=
0 and degree 𝑟 (hence 𝑎 𝑟 ∕= 0), the reciprocal of 𝑓 is the
polynomial denoted by 𝑓 ∗ and deﬁned as
𝑓 ∗ (𝑥) = 𝑥 𝑟 𝑓 (𝑥−1 ) = 𝑎 𝑟 + 𝑎 𝑟−1 𝑥 + . . . + 𝑎0 𝑥 𝑟 .

(4)

If a polynomial 𝑓 is equal to its reciprocal, then 𝑓 is called
self-reciprocal. We can easily verify the following equalities
(𝑓 ∗ )∗ = 𝑓 and (𝑓 𝑔)∗ = 𝑓 ∗ 𝑔 ∗ .

Lemma 2.3: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime. Then the following
holds
(i) If 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠
even, then 𝑥2 + 1 = 0 has a solution 𝛾 ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 .
(ii) If 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4, 𝑠 odd, then 𝑥2 + 1 is irreducible in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 .
Proof. Since 𝑝 ≡ 1 (mod 4), −1 is a quadratic residue in
𝔽 𝑝 ⊂ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [9, Lemma 6.2.4]. Thus there exists 𝛾 ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 such
that 𝛾 2 = −1. If 𝑝 ≡ 3 (mod 4), then 𝑝2 ≡ 1 (mod 4), so
that −1 is a quadratic residue in 𝔽 𝑝2 ⊂ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . The proof of (ii)
is in [6, Proposition 3.1 (ii)].
□

It is well known (see [6, Proposition 2.4] or [9, Theorem
4.4.9]), that the dual of the negacyclic code generated by 𝐴(𝑥)
is the negacyclic code generated by 𝐵 ∗ (𝑥) where
𝐵(𝑥) =

𝑥𝑛+1

𝐴(𝑥)

(6)

Hence we have the following lemma.
Lemma 2.1: A negacyclic code 𝐶 of length 𝑛 generated by
a polynomial 𝐴(𝑥) is self-dual if and only if
𝐴(𝑥) = 𝐵 ∗ (𝑥).
Denote the factors 𝑓 𝑖 in the factorization of 𝑥 𝑚 + 1 which

III. N EGACYCLIC C ODES OF L ENGTH 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 OVER 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠
In this section, we consider the structure of negacyclic
codes over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 of length 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 . We begin with the following
lemma. When (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, 𝑚 an odd integer, Dinh and
L´ pez-Permouth [7, Proposition 5.1] proved that negacyclic
o
codes of length 𝑚 are isomorphic to cyclic codes. Batoul et
al. [1] proved that under some conditions, there also exists
an isomorphism between constacyclic codes and cyclic codes
of length 𝑚. In the following lemma, we prove that there is
an isomorphism between cyclic codes and some constacyclic
codes with conditions different from those in [1], [7].
Lemma 3.1: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime power such that 𝑝 ≡ 1
mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even. Then
𝔽 𝑠 [𝑥]
there is a ring isomorphism between the ring 𝑥 𝑝𝑚 −1 and the
𝔽 𝑠 [𝑥]
ring 𝑥 𝑝𝑚 −𝛾 given by
{
𝑓 (𝛾𝑥)
if 𝑚 ≡ 3 mod 4,
𝜇(𝑓 (𝑥)) =
𝑓 (−𝛾𝑥) if 𝑚 ≡ 1 mod 4.

Theorem 2.2: There exists a self-dual negacyclic code of
length 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 if and only if there is no 𝑔 𝑖 (self𝑟
reciprocal polynomial) in the factorization of 𝑥 𝑚𝑝 + 1 given
in (7). Furthermore, a self-dual negacyclic code 𝐶 is generated
by a polynomial of the following form

Proof. Assume there exists a negacyclic self-dual code 𝐶
of length 𝑛 = 𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . Hence from (3) the code 𝐶
∏ 𝑘𝑖
is generated by 𝐴(𝑥) =
𝑓 𝑖 , where the 𝑓 𝑖 are factors of
𝑥 𝑚 + 1. From (7), we can write

i.e, 𝑠 = 0 in (7) and 𝑐 𝑗 = 𝑝 𝑠 − 𝑏 𝑗 , for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑡. Hence a true if and only if 𝑓 (𝛾𝑥) − 𝑔(𝛾𝑥) = ℎ(𝛾𝑥)((𝛾𝑥) 𝑚 − 1) is

Proof. Let 𝛼 be an 𝑚th primitive root of unity. The
elements of 𝐶𝑙(𝑖) are such that 𝛼 𝑖 is a root of a monic

Theorem 3.2: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime power such that 𝑝 ≡
1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even, and
𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 be an oddly even integer with (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. Then

Assume that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is even and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is odd. Then

A. Self-dual Negacyclic Codes of Length 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟
The purpose of this section is to provide conditions on the
existence of self-dual codes. This is done considering only the
length and characteristic. This gives conditions equivalent to
those in Theorem 2.2 which are much simpler to verify. We
ﬁrst present an example.
Example 3.4: For 𝑚 = 1, we have the following.
(i) If 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠
even, then from Theorem 2.2 there exist self-dual codes of
length 2𝑝 𝑠 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 if and only if none of the irreducible
factors of 𝑥2 + 1 are self-reciprocal. From Lemma 2.3,
there is a solution 𝛾 of 𝑥2 + 1 = 0 in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . Hence the
irreducible factors of 𝑥2 + 1 are 𝑥 − 𝛾 and 𝑥 + 𝛾. Neither
of these polynomials can be self-reciprocal, as we have
(𝑥 − 𝛾)∗ = −𝛾(𝑥 + 𝛾) and (𝑥 + 𝛾)∗ = 𝛾(𝑥 − 𝛾). Hence by
Theorem 2.2 there exist negacyclic self-dual codes of the
following form
𝑟

mod 𝑞 𝛼 .

(10)

If both 𝑖 and 𝑞 𝛼−1 are odd, then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is odd, which
is absurd. Then it must be that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝 𝑟 ) is even, so there
exists some integer 𝑗 such that 0 < 𝑗 < 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝 𝑟 ) and
𝛼−1
𝑝 𝑗 ≡ −1 mod 𝑞. Therefore we have 𝑝 𝑟𝑗𝑞
≡ −1
=
𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (−1).
mod 𝑞 𝛼 , which gives that 𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (1)
Then for all 𝑖 in the cyclotomic classes we have
𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑞 𝛼 (−𝑖). Assume now that 𝑚 = 𝑝1 𝑝2 such
that (𝑝1 , 𝑝2 ) = 1 and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even. Since 𝑚 = 𝑝1 𝑝2 ,
we have that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) = lcm(𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝1 (𝑝 𝑠 ), 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝2 (𝑝 𝑠 ))
is even, and hence either 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝1 (𝑝 𝑠 ) or 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝2 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is
even. Assume that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝1 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even, then there exists
1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝1 (𝑝 𝑠 ) such that (𝑝 𝑠 ) 𝑘 ≡ −1 mod 𝑝1 . Therefore
(𝑝 𝑠 ) 𝑘 (𝑚 − 𝑝2 ) ≡ −(𝑚 − 𝑝2 ) mod 𝑚, with 𝑘 ≤ 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝1 (𝑝 𝑠 ),
and hence 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑚 − 𝑝2 ) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−(𝑚 − 𝑝2 )). The same result
is obtained for 𝑚 = 𝑝1𝛼1 𝑝2𝛼2 . Conversely, assume there exists
a class for which 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−𝑖). Then the elements
of 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) are ±𝑖𝑞 𝑗 for some 𝑗, so 𝐶𝑙(𝑖) contains an even
number of elements. On the other hand the size of each 𝑞
cyclotomic class is a divisor of 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) [9, Theorem 4.1.4].
This gives that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is even.

The result given in (9) was also proven in [6, Theorem 3.2].

(ii) If 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4, 𝑠 odd, then from Lemma 2.3 𝑥2 + 1 is
irreducible in 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . Furthermore, we have (𝑥2 + 1)∗ = 𝑥2 +
1. Hence by Theorem 2.2 there are no self-dual negacyclic
codes in this case.
The results in Example 3.4 are also given in [6, Corollary 3.3].
We now require the following Lemma.
Lemma 3.5: Let 𝑚 be an odd integer and 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) the 𝑝 𝑠
cyclotomic class of 𝑖 modulo 𝑚. The polynomial 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) is the

Theorem 3.7: Let 𝑝 𝑠 be an odd prime power such that 𝑝 ≡
1 mod 4, 𝑠 any integer or 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 4 and 𝑠 even, and
𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 be an oddly even integer with (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1. Then
there exists a negacyclic self-dual code of length 2𝑚𝑝 𝑠 over
𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 if and only if 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is odd.
Proof.
Under the hypothesis on 𝑝, 𝑠 and
𝑚
we have from ∏ Theorem 3.2 that the polynomial

𝑥2𝑚𝑝 + 1 =

and 𝑓 𝑗 (𝑥) are the monic irreducible factors of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1 in
𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 . By Lemma 3.6, 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑚 (𝑝 𝑠 ) is odd if and only if there
is no cyclotomic class such that 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (𝑖) = 𝐶𝑙 𝑚 (−𝑖). From
Lemma 3.5, this is equivalent to saying that there are no
irreducible factors of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1 such that 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) = 𝑓 ∗ (𝑥). From
𝑖
the ring isomorphisms given in Lemma 3.1, we have that
𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) ∕= 𝑓 ∗ (𝑥) for all 𝑖 is true if and only if 𝑓 𝑖 (𝛾𝑥) ∕= 𝑓 ∗ (𝛾𝑥)

IV. R EPEATED ROOT C YCLIC C ODES
It is well known that the cyclic codes of length 𝑛 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠
are principal ideals of 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥]/(𝑥 𝑛 − 1), and these ideals are
generated by the monic factors of 𝑥 𝑛 −1. Hence the importance
of the decomposition of the polynomial 𝑥 𝑛 − 1 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 .
Let 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 , with 𝑚 an odd integer such that (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1.

Then we have the decomposition 𝑥 𝑛 − 1 = (𝑥2𝑚 − 1) 𝑝 =

𝑟
(𝑥 𝑚 − 1) 𝑝 (𝑥 𝑚 + 1) 𝑝 . Since (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, the polynomials
𝑥 𝑚 − 1 and 𝑥 𝑚 + 1 factor uniquely as the product of monic
irreducible pairwise coprime polynomials given by 𝑥 𝑚 − 1 =
∏𝑘
∏𝑙
𝑚
𝑖=1 𝑓 𝑖 and 𝑥 + 1 =
𝑗=1 𝑔 𝑗 . This is due to the fact that
(𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, so the roots are simple [7, Proposition 2.7]. Let
𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥) be a monic irreducible divisor of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1. Then there
exists ℎ(𝑥) ∈ 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 [𝑥] such that 𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥)ℎ(𝑥) = 𝑥 𝑚 −1, and hence
𝑓 𝑖 (−𝑥)ℎ(−𝑥) = (−𝑥) 𝑚 − 1 = −(𝑥 𝑚 + 1). Therefore 𝑓 𝑖 (−𝑥)
is a monic irreducible divisor of 𝑥 𝑚 + 1. This gives that the
factorization of 𝑥 𝑛 − 1 is

𝑝 is not a quadratic residue modulo 𝑞. Then we have the
following.
(i) If 𝑞 ≡ 1 (mod 4), then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) ≡ 0 (mod 4).

Proof. Assume that 𝑝 is not a quadratic residue modulo
𝑞. Then from [9, Lemma 6.2.2] 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) is not a divisor of
𝑝−1
2 , so from Fermat’s Little Theorem 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) = 𝑞 − 1.
Hence 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) ≡ 0 (mod 4) since 𝑞 ≡ 1 (mod 4). If 𝑞 ≡ 3
□
(mod 4), then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) = 𝑞 − 1 ≡ 0 (mod 2).

Hence a cyclic code of length 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 over 𝔽 𝑝 𝑠 is of the
form

(𝑓 𝑖 (𝑥)) 𝛼 𝑖
where 0 ≤ 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝛽 𝑗 ≤ 𝑝 𝑟 , 1 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘, and 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑖 ≤ 𝑘 is an
irreducible factor of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1. This gives the following result.
Proposition 4.1: For 𝑝 an odd prime, the cyclic codes of
length 𝑛 = 2𝑚𝑝 𝑟 , 𝑚 an odd integer such that (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1, are
generated by

〈∏
∏
(𝑓 𝑗 (−𝑥)) 𝛽 𝑗 ,

Lemma 3.10: Let 𝑛 be a positive integer and 𝑞 a prime
power such that (𝑞, 𝑛) = 1. Then we have the following.
(i) If 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞) is even, then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞 2 ) = 𝑜𝑟𝑑2𝑛 (𝑞) .
(ii) If 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞) is odd, then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞 2 ) = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞).
Proof. Let 𝑟 = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞) and 𝑟′ = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞 2 ). Then we have
′
𝑞 2𝑟 ≡ 1 mod 𝑛, which implies that 𝑟∣2𝑟′ . Since 𝑟 is even,
𝑟
𝑟
we have (𝑞 2 ) 2 = 𝑞 𝑟 ≡ 1 mod 𝑛, and then 𝑟′ ∣ 2 . Hence we
𝑟
obtain that 𝑟′ = 2 . This proves part (i). For part (ii), assume
again that 𝑟 = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞) is odd and 𝑟′ = 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑛 (𝑞 2 ). We then
have that 𝑟∣2𝑟′ , and since 𝑟 is odd it must be that 𝑟∣𝑟′ . On
the other hand, we have 𝑞 2𝑟 ≡ 𝑛, so that 𝑟′ ∣𝑟, and therefore
□
𝑟 = 𝑟′ .

where 0 ≤ 𝛼 𝑖 , 𝛽 𝑗 ≤ 𝑝 𝑟 , 1 ≤ 𝑖, 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘, and 𝑓 𝑖 , 𝑖 ≤ 𝑘, is a
monic irreducible factor of 𝑥 𝑚 − 1.
A. The Number of Cyclic Self-dual Codes
It has been proven [6], [10], [11] that cyclic self-dual codes
exist if and only if the characteristic is 2. Since a self-dual
cyclic code must have even length and characteristic 2, cyclic
self-dual codes have repeated roots. In [11, Corollary 2], Jia
et al. gave the number of self-dual cyclic codes in some
cases. The remainder of this characterization was left as an
open problem, namely the case when the length of the code
contains a prime factor congruent to 1 mod 8. The following
proposition is used in answering this problem.
Proposition 4.2: Let 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8 be an odd prime number, and 𝑚 be an odd number. Then we have the following
implication

Corollary 3.11: Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be two distinct primes such
that 𝑝 is not a quadratic residue modulo 𝑞. Then if 𝑞 ≡ 1
(mod 4) and 𝑝 ≡ 1 (mod 4), there is no self-dual negacyclic
code of length 2𝑝𝑞 𝛼 over 𝔽 𝑝 or 𝔽 𝑝2 .
Proof. From Lemma 3.9, if 𝑞 ≡ 1 (mod 4) and 𝑝 is not
a quadratic residue modulo 𝑞, then 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝) ≡ 0 (mod 4).
Hence from Lemma 3.10, 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 (𝑝2 ) is even. Then the
proof of Lemma 3.6 implies that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑞 𝛼 (𝑝2 ) is even. Hence
from Theorem 3.7 there are no self-dual negacyclic codes of
□
length 2𝑞 𝛼 𝑝 over 𝔽 𝑝 or 𝔽 𝑝2 .

𝑙

𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2) = 2 𝑘 𝑒 ⇒ ∀ 0 ≤ 𝑙 ≤ 𝑘, 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (22 ) = 2 𝑘−𝑙 𝑒.
Proof. Since 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8, from [9, Lemma 6.2.5] 2
is a quadratic residue modulo 𝑝. Hence 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2)∣ 𝑝−1 , i.e.,
2
𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2) = 2 𝑘 𝑒 for some 𝑘 > 0. Then from Lemma 3.10 (i)
we have that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (22 ) = 2 𝑘−1 𝑒. Using the same argument 𝑙
times, the result follows.
□

Example 3.12: For 𝑝 = 5, 𝑞 = 13 and 𝑞 = 17 satisfy
the hypothesis of Corollary 3.11. Hence there are no self-dual
negacyclic codes over 𝔽5 and 𝔽25 with lengths 130, 170 or
1690.

Corollary 4.3: Let 𝑛 = 2 𝑟 𝑝 𝛼 . Then there is a unique
negacyclic self-dual code of length 𝑛 over 𝔽2 𝑠 generated by
𝛼
𝑟−1
𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥 𝑝 + 1)2
in the following cases
(i) 𝑝 ≡ 3 mod 8, 𝑠 odd,
(ii) 𝑝 ≡ 5 mod 8, 𝑠 odd or 𝑠 ≡ 2 mod 4,
(iii) 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8 and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2) = 2 𝑘 𝑒, and 𝑠 = 2 𝑙 ,
0 < 𝑙 < 𝑘.
Proof. Parts (i) and (ii) follow from [11, Proposition 2].
When 𝑝 ≡ 1 mod 8 and 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2) = 2 𝑘 𝑒, for 𝑠 = 2 𝑙 with
0 < 𝑙 < 𝑘, from Proposition 4.2 we have that 𝑜𝑟𝑑 𝑝 (2 𝑠 )
is an even integer. Hence from [11, Theorem 4] there is
𝛼
𝑟−1
a unique self-dual code generated by 𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥 𝑝 + 1)2 . □
