Abstract—We consider a broadcast channel with three receivers and three-degraded message sets, where the transmitter
has a common message intended for all three receivers, a message
intended for receivers 2 and 3, and a private message intended
for receiver 3. The messages are transmitted over a family of
parallel degraded broadcast channels. In the most general case,
there are six parallel degraded broadcast channels with different
orders of degradedness. We determine the capacity region for
two classes of broadcast channels, one with ﬁve parallel degraded
broadcast channels and the other with three parallel degraded
broadcast channels. The main difﬁculty is in identifying the
relevant auxiliary random variables in the proofs of the converse.
To accomplish this, we make use of an information theoretic
inequality that can be proven using the Csisz´ r-sum identity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Consider a discrete memoryless broadcast channel (BC)
with an input X and three outputs W (receiver 1), Y (receiver
2) and Z (receiver 3) as shown in Figure 1. There are threedegraded message sets (M1 , M2 , M3 ), where the message M1
is intended for all three receivers, the message M2 is intended
for receivers 2 and 3 and the message M3 is intended only
for receiver 3. A formal deﬁnition for this BC extends rather
straightforwardly from the two-user case (see [1]). This model
is especially applicable in a video broadcast, where different
users receive different quality versions of the same video. In
our case, user 1 receives the lowest quality version while user
3 receives the highest quality one.
The capacity region of the general two-user BC with twodegraded message sets was established by K¨ rner and Marton
o
[1], where they made use of the Csisz´ r-sum identity [2].
a
Recently, Nair and El Gamal extensively studied the threeuser case in [3], where they showed that a straightforward
extension of the K¨ rner-Marton region is strictly suboptimal.
o
The Nair-El Gamal achievable rate region for the three-user
case was shown to be tight for the following cases:
• Three-receiver BCs with two-degraded message sets,
(M1 , M3 ), where M1 is the common message to be
decoded by all three receivers and M3 is the message
to be decoded by receiver 3. Furthermore, Z is a less
noisy receiver than W (see [3, Prop. 7]).
• Deterministic three-receiver BCs with two-degraded message sets, (M1 , M2 ), where M1 is the common message

Three-receiver BC with three-degraded message sets

to be decoded by all three receivers and M2 is the
message to be decoded by receivers 2 and 3 (see [3, Prop.
10]). It is also capacity achieving when Y is a less noisy
receiver than W and also Z is a less noisy receiver than
W (see [3, Prop. 11]).
However, the capacity region of the general three-user BC
with three-degraded message sets remain unresolved. One of
the main difﬁculties is in extending the Csisz´ r-sum identity
a
from the two-user case to the three-user case.
In this paper, we prove that the achievable rate region is also
tight for a new class of three-user BCs, where the degraded
messages are transmitted over the product of a family of
parallel degraded BCs (we note that the product BC is not a
degraded BC). The most general case consists of the product
of the following degraded BCs:
X 1 → Z 1 → Y 1 → W1 ,
X 2 → Y 2 → Z 2 → W2 ,

(1)
(2)

X3 → W3 → Z3 → Y3 ,
X4 → W4 → Y4 → Z4 ,

(3)
(4)

X 5 → Y 5 → W5 → Z 5 ,
X6 → Z6 → W6 → Y6 .

(5)
(6)

In fact, any family of parallel degraded three-user BCs can be
decomposed into the above six subchannels.
In this paper, we characterize the capacity region for two
sub-classes of the most general case. Speciﬁcally, we are
able to give a single letter characterization of the capacity
region for the BC which consists of the product of the
subchannels (1)-(5) as well as for the BC which consists of
the product of the subchannels (1)-(2) and (6). Though we are
not able to characterize the capacity region of the most general

case, nonetheless, our results here encompass a large class of
parallel degraded BCs.
Our main motivation is that this models many practical
communication channels, such as the spectral Gaussian BC,
BC with ISI, fading BC, etc (see [4]). In fact, the class
of parallel degraded BCs was ﬁrst considered by El Gamal
for the two-user case with one common message and two
private messages [5]. Speciﬁcally, El Gamal established the
capacity region of the two-user reversely degraded BC for the
discrete memoryless case. He also made use of the single letter
characterization for the discrete memoryless case, together
with the entropy power inequality, to characterize the capacity
region of the spectral Gaussian BC. In a subsequent paper, we
will likewise make use of the single letter characterizations
in this paper to characterize the capacity region of some
classes of three-user spectral Gaussian BC with three-degraded
message sets. However, due to space constraints, we will focus
on the discrete memoryless case here.
Interestingly, the converse proofs of previous capacity theorems for BCs involving a family of parallel degraded BCs (see
[4], [5], [6]) do not require the use of the Csisz´ r-sum identity.
a
However, we show that this is not the case for the threeuser case with three-degraded message sets. In order to give
single letter characterizations, we ﬁrst derive an intermediate
information theoretic inequality using the Csisz´ r-sum identity.
a
This inequality is then used to derive the capacity region of
the ﬁrst class of three-user parallel degraded BCs in Section
II. In Section III, we consider the second class of three-user
parallel degraded BCs. We conclude the paper in Section IV.

We can now state the capacity theorem for the ﬁrst class of
three-user parallel degraded BC:
Theorem 1: The capacity region, Cπ,1 , of a discrete memoryless three-receiver BC, with three degraded message sets,
consisting of the product of ﬁve parallel degraded BCs given
by (1)-(5) consists of the set of all rate triplets (R1 , R2 , R3 )

for some input probability distributions given by

Proof: The achievability follows from [3, Thm. 2] by
assuming independent input distributions for each subchannel,
following that given by (21), with the auxiliary random
variables in [3, Thm. 2] given by

Furthermore, it is relatively easy to show that some of the rate
inequalities in [3, Thm. 2] are redundant here.
The bulk of the proof lies in the converse and in identifying
the relevant auxiliary random variables. We will focus on
the proof for (16) and (18). The proof for the rest of the
inequalities follow accordingly.
To prove the inequality (16), we consider the following:

N
+ I M2 , M3 ; W(3→4) |M1 , Z(1→4) ,

(26)

where (a) follows from the Csisz´ r-sum identity.

The other inequalities above follow from standard properties
of mutual information and the order of degradedness for each
of the subchannels.
Combining (22) to (26), we obtain (16) by setting

where (a) follows from Lemma 1 and the degradedness order
of the subchannels.
Combining (27)-(31), we obtain (18) by setting V1,n =
n−1
n−1
M1 , M2 , W1,1 , Y1,1
and by making using of the same
time-sharing random variable Q. Furthermore, we note that
U1,n → V1,n → X1,n forms a Markov chain.
The rest of the terms may also be derived by setting
n−1
N
U3,n = M1 , M2 , Z1 , Y2N , Y3,1 . Finally, we observe that
the capacity region is not increased by admitting more general
input probability distributions.
Remark 2: It is interesting to note that even though U5 →
X5 → W5 → Z5 forms a Markov chain, receiver 1 (W ) only
decodes part of the message (represented by U5 ) transmitted
through the subchannel 5. Receiver 3, however, decodes the
full message (represented by X5 ) even though Z5 is a degraded
version of W5 .
Remark 3: In the course of our work, we noticed that the
converse could not be proven if the subchannels are expanded
in the wrong sequence. In this paper, we have expanded the
subchannels sequentially (see (22)-(26) and (27)-(31)).
Remark 4: We also note that the Csisz´ r-sum identity as
a
well as Lemma 1 were crucial in the proof of the converse. In
fact, going through the proof shows that the converse holds as
long as X5 → Y5 → W5 and X5 → Y5 → Z5 form Markov
chains. No order of degradedness is necessary between W5
and Z5 as this was also the assumption in Lemma 1.

and by introducing a time-sharing random variable Q. Furthermore, we note that U6,n → V6,n → X6,n forms a Markov
chain. The rest of the terms may be proven accordingly.
Remark 5: We note that W is a degraded version of Z.
However, W and Z are not degraded versions of Y and Y
is also not a degraded version of Z. This is reminiscent of
the three-user multilevel BC with two-degraded message sets
considered by Nair and El Gamal, where W is a degraded
version of Z. However, in our particular case, there are three

degraded message sets instead of two and we consider a
product channel rather than the general case.
Remark 6: Even though the Csisz´ r-sum identity cannot be

extended to three users in general, we are able to obtain (41)
through Lemma 1 (as well as the the Csisz´ r-sum identity)
a
as both W6 and Y6 are degraded versions of Z6 . In fact,
going through the converse proof, one can show that the
capacity region still holds as long as this is true. No order
of degradedness is necessary between W6 and Y6 .
IV. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we give single letter characterizations of two
classes of parallel degraded BCs. There are three necessary
components in the proofs of these two classes of channels.
The ﬁrst critical component is in the proof of the achievability for the ﬁrst class of channels, where we allow receiver
1 to decode only part of the message (represented by U5 )
in subchannel 5 and allowing receiver 3 to decode the full
message (represented by X5 ) even though Z5 is a degraded
version of W5 . Similarly, a critical part in the proof of the
achievability for the second class of channels involves allowing
receiver 1 to decode U6 in subchannel 6 and allowing receiver
2 to decode (U6 , V6 ) even though Y6 is a degraded version
of W6 . The second critical component is in the proof of the
converse, where we must expand the subchannels in the correct
sequence. The third critical component follows from the fact
that the Csisz´ r-sum identity cannot be extended to three users
a
in general. We introduce an information theoretic inequality
that allows us to bypass this difﬁculty for the product channels
considered.
However, we are still unable to characterize the capacity
region for the most general case. Whether this is due to the
best inner bound being non-capacity achieving, or due to the
wrong choice of input probability distributions, or due to
the lack of techniques to prove the converse remains to be
in seen. Nonetheless, our results encompass a large class of
parallel degraded BCs. In a subsequent work, we make use
of the results here to characterize the capacity region of some
classes of spectral Gaussian BC with three receivers and threedegraded message sets.
