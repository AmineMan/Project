II. BACKGROUND

Abstract—In this paper we consider the problem of transmitting a continuous alphabet discrete-time source over an AWGN
channel. The design of good curves for this purpose relies on
geometrical properties of spherical codes and projections of N dimensional lattices. We propose a constructive scheme based on
a set of curves on the surface of a 2N -dimensional sphere and
present comparisons with some previous works.

A. Flat Tori
The unit sphere S 2N −1 ⊂ R2N can be foliated with ﬂat tori
[1], [7] as follows. For each unit vector c = (c1 , c2 , .., cN ) ∈
RN , ci > 0, and u = (u1 , u2 , . . . , uN ) ∈ RN , let Φc : RN →
R2N be deﬁned by

The problem of designing good codes for continuous alphabet sources to be transmitted over a channel with power
constraint can be viewed as the one of constructing curves
in the Euclidean space of maximal length and such that its
folds (or laps) are a good distance apart. When the channel
noise is bellow a certain threshold, a bigger length essentially
means a higher resolution when estimating the sent value. On
the other hand, if the folds of the curve come too close, this
threshold will be small and the mean squared error (mse) will
be dominated by larger errors as consequence of decoding
to the wrong fold. Explicit constructions of curves for analog
source-channel coding were presented, for example, in [8] and
[9].
In this work, we will consider spherical curves in the 2N dimensional Euclidean space. We develop an extension of the
construction presented in [8] to a set of curves on layers
of ﬂat tori. Our approach explores geometrical properties of
spherical codes and projections of N -dimensional lattices. In
the scheme presented here, homogeneity and low decoding
complexity properties were preserved whereas the total length
can be meaningfully increased.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce some mathematical background used in our approach.
In Section III we state the problem, while in Section IV we
present a scheme to design piecewise homogeneous curves
on the Euclidean sphere and describe the encoding/decoding
process. In Section V we derive a scaled version of the
Lifting Construction [6] suitable to our problem and present
some examples and length comparisons with some previous
constructions.

This periodic function Φc is a local isometry on its image,

hyperbox:

Note also that each vector of S 2N −1 belongs to one, and
only one, of these ﬂat tori if we consider also the degenerated
cases where some ci may vanish. Thus we say that the family
of ﬂat tori Tc and their degenerations, with c = (c1 , c2 , .., cN ),
c = 1, ci ≥ 0, deﬁned above is a foliation on the unit sphere
of S 2N −1 ⊂ R2N .

IV. O UR APPROACH
A. Torus layers
Given a ﬁxed small ball radius δ, the ﬁrst step of our
approach is to deﬁne a collection T = {T1 , T2 , · · · , TM } of
ﬂat tori on S 2N −1 such that the minimum distance (3) between
any two of them is greater than 2δ. This step is equivalent
to design a N -dimensional spherical code SC with minimum
distance 2δ and consider just the points with non-negative
coordinates.
We denote this sub-code by

B. Curves
As pointed out in [8], some important properties of a curve
from a communication point of view are its stretch and smallball radius. Given a curve s : [a, b] → RN , the Voronoi region
V (x) of a point s (x) is the set of all points in RN which
are closer to s (x) than to any other point of the curve. If
H(x) denotes the hyperplane orthogonal to the curve at s (x),
then the maximal small-ball radius of s is the largest r > 0
s
such that Br (s (x)) ∩ H(x) ⊂ V (x) for all x ∈ [a, b], where
s
Br (s (x)) is the Euclidean ball of radius r centered at s (x).
Intuitively this means that the “tube” of radius r placed along
the curve does not intersect itself. The stretch S(x) is the
˙
˙
˙
function s (x) where s (x) is the derivative of s (x). If s
does not depend on x (as it is the case of the curves considered
here) we will refer to the stretch as simply S. The length
b
of a curve is given by a S(x)dx. In this paper we will be
interested in curves with large length and small-ball radius.

SC+ = {c ∈ SC, ci ≥ 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ N } .
Each point c ∈ SC+ deﬁnes a hyperbox Pc (2) and hence a
ﬂat torus Tc in the unit sphere S 2N −1 .
There are several ways of constructing spherical codes that
can be employed here, e.g. [3], [4] or even on layers of ﬂat
tori as introduced in [7].
B. Curves on each torus
Let Tc be a torus represented by the vector c ∈ SC+ as
deﬁned in the previous section. On the surface of Tc we will
consider curves of the form:

III. P ROBLEM STATEMENT
The underlying communication system we consider here is
illustrated in Figure 1. Given an input real value x, within
the unit interval [0, 1], the encoder maps x into a point s (x)
of a curve s on S 2N −1 , which will be sent over an AWGN
channel. By properly scaling the curve we guarantee that the
transmitted energy is α2 . The decoder will then compute an
estimate for the sent value while trying to minimize the mean
ˆ
squared error (mse) E[(X − X)2 ] of the process.
For the torus layers scheme, the unit interval will be
partitioned into M intervals of different length, and each of
them mapped into a curve on one of the layers. It is worth
noticing that, for the special case M = 1, if we choose the
torus associated to the vector c = √1 (1, . . . , 1) to encode
N
the information, then the scheme proposed here is exactly
the one analysed in [8]. However, we are interested in the
analysis for M > 1, in which case the curves to be presented
outperform the ones presented in [8] (see also [6]) in terms
of the tradeoff between length and small-ball radius.

where C = diag(c1 , . . . , cL ), u = u C = (c1 u1 , . . . , cN uN ),
Φc is given by (1) and x ∈ [0, 1].
Provided that u ∈ ZN , gcd(ui ) = 1, those curves
are closed (a type (u1 , . . . , uN )-knot), and due to
periodicity and local isometry properties of Φc their
ˆ
lengths are 2π u . They are also the image through
Φc of the intersection between the set of lines
ˆ

W = u x + n : n = n C, n ∈ ZL and the box Pc . For
c = √1 (1, . . . , 1), these are exactly the curves analysed in

[8].

Let Λc = c1 Z ⊕ . . . ⊕ cN Z be the rectangular lattice

The design of those curves in the next section is essentially
divided in two parts. First, we choose a collection of tori on
the surface of the Euclidean sphere S 2N −1 at least δ apart.
The approach for doing this is via discrete spherical codes
in RN . Second, we show a systematic way of constructing
curves on each layer, via projection-lattices in RN −1 . Finally,
we give a description of the whole signal locus and summarize
the encoding process.

1 In general, the projection of a lattice Λ onto a subspace H is not a
lattice unless certain special conditions are met, e.g., when H ⊥ is spanned
by primitive vectors of Λ [5]. This will be always the case in this paper, since
ˆ
ˆ
H = u ⊥ for a primitive vector u .

Then the full encoding map s can be deﬁned by
s (x) := s Tk (fk (x)), if x ∈ Ik .

(12)

The stretch of s will be constant and equal its total length
L and the small-ball radius of s is the minimum small-ball
radius δ of the curves s Tk , provided that the distance between
any pair of torus in T is at least 2δ.
To encode a value x within [0, 1] we apply the map (12).
The signal locus will be a set of M closed curves, each one
lying on a torus layer Tk and deﬁned by a vector u k . This
whole process is illustrated in Figure 2.

equivalent to ZN and it was shown in [6] that we can make the
above bound as tight as we want. We will show in Section V
that this is also true for an arbitrary c i.e., that projections of
the rectangular lattice Λc can also yield dense lattice packings
and therefore we can construct curves on the ﬂat torus with
the parameters arbitrary close to this bound.

2
α = πc1 c2 / v . In Figure 2 it is illustrated the curve
(u1 , u2 ) = (4, 5), with c1 > c2 .

Fig. 2: Encoding Process
If the source is uniformly distributed over [0, 1], the encoding process presented above is a proper one, since all
subintervals will be equally stretched. For other applications,
however, it could be worth considering another partition.

C. Encoding
Let T = {T1 , . . . , TM } be a collection of M tori as
designed in Section IV-A. For each one of these tori, let
u
s Tk (x) = Φ(2πˆ k x), (k = 1, 2, . . . , M ) be the curve on Tk ,
M

determined by the vector u k (5) and consider L = j=1 lj ,
where lk is the length of s Tk .
Now split the unit interval [0, 1] into M pieces according
to the length of each curve:

D. Decoding
Given a received vector y ∈ R2N , the maximum likelihood
decoding is ﬁnding x such that:

x = arg min

Since exactly solving this problem is computationally expensive we focus on a suboptimal decoder.

proving the ﬁrst statement. For the second statement, we

[L∗ 0 ] [L∗ 0 ] = L∗ L∗t .

From now on, we proceed the process by using a slight
modiﬁcation of the torus decoding algorithm [8] applied to
the N -dimensional hyperbox Pc i . The complexity of this
algorithm is given by O(N u i 1 ), where u i is the vector that
determines the curve s Ti . Hence, if M = O(maxi u i 1 ), the
overall complexity of the process described in this section will
be O(N maxi u i 1 ), the same as for the torus decoding.

Example 2. Consider the hexagonal lattice [2], which is the
best packing in two dimensions and is equivalent to its dual.

A. The construction
The Lifting Construction was proposed in [6] as a solution
to the problem of ﬁnding dense lattices which are equivalent
to orthogonal projections of ZN along integer vectors (“fatstrut” problem). In this section we adapt that strategy in order
to construct projections of the lattice Λc which approximate
any (N − 1) dimensional lattice (hence the densest one) with
the objective of ﬁnding curves in RN approaching the bound
(9). We adopt here the lattice terms as in [2]. For our purposes,
the proximity measure for lattices will be the distance between
their Gram matrices, as in [6]. This notion measures how close
a lattice is to another one up to congruence transformations
(rotations or reﬂections).
x
The dual of a lattice Λ ∈ RN is the set Λ∗ = {x ∈ span(Λ) :
y
x , y ∈ Z ∀y ∈ Λ} where span(Λ) is the subspace spanned
by a basis of Λ. Now let Λc = c1 Z ⊕ . . . ⊕ cN Z be the
rectangular lattice generated by the diagonal matrix C (and
with Gram matrix CC t = C 2 ). By scaling Λc , we can assume
that c1 = 1. With this condition, if Pu ⊥ (Λc )∗ denotes the dual
ˆ
of the projection of Λc onto a vector u = (1, u2 c2 . . . , uN cN )
(ui ∈ Z), then a generator matrix for Pu ⊥ (Λc )∗ is given by

The projections of c1 Z ⊕ c2 Z ⊕ c3 Z onto u ⊥ will be, up to
equivalence, arbitrarily close to A2 when w → ∞.
B. Comparisons: Curves in R6
Here we compare our approach of construct curves on torus
layers with the curves constructed in [6] and [8] in terms of
length for given small-ball radii. Given δ > 0, we ﬁrst consider
a set of ﬂat tori associated to a spherical code in R3 , with
minimum distance greater than 2δ, as described in Section
IV-A. Through the ﬁrst inequality of (8), for each torus, we
can ﬁnd rc in order to guarantee that the curves on the ﬂat
tori will have small-ball radius at least δ (this is also done in
√
the case of the curves on the torus c = 1/ L(1, 1, 1)). We
then look for the larger element of the sequence of vectors
that produces a projection with minimum distance at least rc .

VI. C ONCLUSION
The problem of transmitting a continuous alphabet source
over an AWGN channel was considered through an approach
based on curves designed in layers of ﬂat tori on the surface
of a (2N )-dimensional Euclidean sphere. This approach explores connections with constructions of spherical codes and
is related to the problem of ﬁnding dense projections of the
lattice c1 Z ⊕ . . . ⊕ cN Z.
This work is a generalization of both the scheme proposed
in [8] and the Lifting Construction in [6]. As a consequence,
our scheme compares favorably to previous works in terms of
the tradeoff between total length and small-ball radius, which
is a proper ﬁgure of merit for this communication system.
In spite of the improvements in terms of length versus smallball radius, the constructiveness, homogeneity and overall
complexity of the decoding algorithm are features preserved
from [8].
