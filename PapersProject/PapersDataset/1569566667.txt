Networks

However, the quality and success of such services are governed
by guaranteeing a good coverage, particularly in areas that are
densely populated. This paper suggests the use of relays to
provide better coverage in such strategically important areas.
The main transmitter which is a central TV broadcasting
unit (like a satellite) uses two parallel relays in large density
areas to improve coverage. According to the large number
of relay pairs covering their respective areas and also the
large number of users in each designated area, neither the
main transmitter nor the relays can access the forward-channel
state information. Due to the stringent delay constraint, the
transmission block length is forced to be much shorter than
the dynamics of the slow fading process, though still large
enough to yield a reliable communication. Shamai and Steiner
[5] proposed a broadcast approach (multi-layer coding) for a
single user block fading channel with no CSI at the transmitter,
which optimizes the average decodable rate. This approach
was used in [6] for the dual-hop single-user channel and in
[7] for cooperation between two collocated users. Multi-layer
coding can also achieve the maximum average rate in a block
fading multiple-access channel with no CSI at the transmitters
[8]. The optimum trade-off between the QoS and network
coverage in a multicast network was characterized in [4] using
the broadcast approach.
The authors proposed a decode-forward (DF) relaying strategy adopting multi-layer coding for the parallel relay network
in [9]. The average achievable rate performance improvement
in the proposed scheme was elaborated.
In this paper, for further performance improvement, other
relaying strategies adopting multi-layer coding over dual-hop
networks with parallel relays are proposed, where neither
the transmitter nor the relays access their forward-channel
gain. The main focus of this work is on simple and efﬁcient
schemes, since the relays can not buffer multiple packets and
also handle large delays. First, amplify-forward (AF) relaying
is analyzed. In contrast to DF relaying, in AF relaying, the relays do not need to know the codebook used by the source, and
also there is no decoding delay at the relays. The performance
of AF relaying will be improved using the concept of ON/OFF
AF relaying. In ON/OFF AF relaying, each relay with the
backward-channel gain less than a pre-determined threshold
becomes silent. In terms of performance with throughput and
expected-rate metrics, in the cases where the ratio of the relay
power to the source power is high, the proposed AF relaying
outperforms the DF relaying presented in [9]. For further

Abstract—This paper studies the problem of dual-hop transmission from a source to a destination via two parallel fullduplex relays in block Rayleigh fading environment. All nodes
in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their forwardchannel gains, however, they have perfect information about their
backward-channel gains. We also assume a stringent decoding
delay constraint of one fading block that makes the deﬁnition
of ergodic (Shannon) capacity meaningless. Hence, we adopt
the broadcast approach to increase the expected-rate received
at the destination. The focus of this paper is on simple, efﬁcient, and practical relaying schemes to increase the average
achievable rate at the destination. The maximum expected-rate of
ON/OFF based amplify-forward relaying is analytically derived.
For further performance improvement, a hybrid decode-amplifyforward relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach at
the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput
and expected-rate are presented. Finally, two different upperbounds, based on the full cooperation between the relays, are
obtained. All theoretical results are illustrated by numerical
simulations. As it turns out from the numerical results, when
the ratio of the relay power to the source power is low, the
proposed hybrid decode-amplify-forward relaying scheme meets
the obtained upper-bound.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The information theoretic aspects of wireless networks
have recently received wide attention. Fading is often used
for modeling the wireless channels. The growing demand
for quality of service (QoS) and network coverage inspires
the use of several intermediate wireless nodes to help the
communication among distant nodes, which is referred to
as relaying or multi-hopping. The problems of transmission
between a disconnected source and destination via two parallel
relays were analyzed in [1] for the additive white Gaussian
(AWGN) channels and in [2] for the case where the relays
transmit in orthogonal frequency bands/time slots. Diversity
gains in a parallel relay network using distributed space-time
codes, where channel state information (CSI) is only at the
receivers, was presented in [3].
The growing adoption of broadcast mobile TV services
suggests that they have the potential to become a mass market
application. A good example for such networks is a TV
broadcasting system from a satellite to cellphones through
base stations where users with higher quality channels might
receive additional services, like high deﬁnition TV signal [4].

average power constraint Ps , and the received signal at the
i’th relay is denoted by Yri = hri X + Zri , i = 1, 2. The i.i.d.
AWGN at the i’th relay is represented by Zri ∼ CN (0, 1),
and hri ∼ CN (0, 1) is the channel coefﬁcient from the
transmitter to the i’th relay. The i’th relay forwards a signal
Xri to the destination under the total average power constraint Pr . Hence, the received signal at the destination is
Y = h1 Xr1 + h2 Xr2 + Z, where Z ∼ CN (0, 1) is the i.i.d.
AWGN and hi ∼ CN (0, 1) is the channel coefﬁcient from
the i’th relay to the receiver. All hi and hri are assumed
to be constant during two consecutive transmission blocks.
Obviously, channel gains ai = |hi |2 and ari = |hri |2 have
exponential distribution.
Note that the transmitter as well as both relays and the
receiver are equipped with one antenna. We assume that the
relays operate in a full-duplex mode and they are not capable
of buffering data over multiple coding blocks or rescheduling
tasks. Since there is no link between the relays, the half-duplex
mode is a direct result of the full-duplex mode with frequency
or time division.

performance improvement, a hybrid decode-amplify-forward
scheme called DAF is proposed, where each relay decodes and
forwards a portion of the layers and ampliﬁes and forwards
the rest. Note that no relay has any information about the
number of layers being decoded by the other relay. As it turns
out from the numerical results, the proposed DAF strategy
outperforms both DF and AF schemes. For both schemes,
the maximum throughput and expected-rate are formulated. To
verify the performance of the schemes, two upper-bounds on
maximum expected-rate of the network are obtained. The ﬁrst
one is based on full cooperation between the relays, while the
second upper-bound is the network cutset-bound. It is shown
that the proposed hybrid DAF meets the upper-bounds for low
values of the ratio of the relay power to the source power.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II,
the preliminaries are presented. The maximum achievable
throughput and continuous-layer expected-rate of ON/OFF
based AF relaying is derived in section III. The multi-layer
DAF relaying scheme is proposed in section IV, and its maximum achievable throughput and expected-rate are analyzed.
Upper-bounds on the maximum throughput and expected-rate
of the network in consideration are obtained in section V. In
section VI, numerical results are provided. Finally, section VII
concludes the paper.

III. A MPLIFY-F ORWARD R ELAYS
A simple but efﬁcient relaying solution for parallel relay
networks is to amplify and forward the received signals. In
order for the destination to coherently decode the signals,
it employs a distributed space-time code permutation along
with the threshold-based ON/OFF power scheme, which has
been shown that improves the performance of AF relaying
[3]. According to the ON/OFF concept, any relay whose
backward-channel gain is less than a pre-determined threshold,
namely ath , is silent. In this scheme, the relays transmit the
signals to the destination in two consecutive time slots. In time
slot t, the ﬁrst (resp. second) relay transmits c1 Yr1 (t) (resp.
c2 Yr2 (t + 1)). In time slot t + 1, the ﬁrst (resp. second) relay
transmits −c1 Yr∗ (t + 1) (resp. c2 Yr∗ (t)) with the backward2

At the destination, the channels are parallelized using the
Alamouti decoding procedure [10].
The maximum achievable throughput of the above AF
scheme is speciﬁed by

∗
transmits −Xr1 (t + 1) (resp. Xr2 (t)) with the backwardchannel phase compensation. There are three possibilities:
1) ar1 ≥ s and ar2 ≥ s: both relays decode the signal. In
this case DAF is simpliﬁed to DF (see [9]).
2) ar1 < s and ar2 < s: none of the relays decodes the
signal. This case is simpliﬁed to AF (see section III).
3) ar1 ≥ s, ar2 < s or ar1 < s, ar2 ≥ s: only one relay
decodes the signal.
In the third case, without loss of generality, assume that the
ﬁrst relay decodes the signal and the second relay does not
decode it, i.e, ar1 ≥ s, ar2 < s. Hence, Xr1 (t) = αX(t) and
Xr2 (t) = c2 Yr2 (t) = c2 (hr2 γX1 (t) + Zr2 (t)), where α2 =

comparison of this method and the DF scheme reveals that if

To increase the average achievable rate at the destination,
a multi-layer code is transmitted at the source. Since the
expected-rate increases with the number of code layers, the
continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) expected-rate of the above AF
scheme is presented in theorem 1, which does not lend itself
to a closed form expression. The proof is omitted, due to the

B. Expected-Rate

In this section, we propose a DAF relaying strategy which
takes advantage of amplifying the layers that could not be
decoded at the relays in the DF scheme of [9]. Speciﬁcally,
each relay tries to decode as many layers as possible and
forward them by spending a portion of its power budget. The
remaining power is dedicated to amplifying and forwarding
the rest of the layers. One important feature of this scheme
is that all layers are combined coherently at the destination
although each relay has no information about the number of
layers being successfully decoded by the other relay.
In order to enhance the lucidity of this section, single-layer
coding is studied ﬁrst. The idea is then extended to multi-layer
coding. As the continuous-layer expected-rate of this scheme is
a seemingly intractable problem, a ﬁnite-layer coding scenario
is analyzed.

Applying the ﬁnite-layer broadcast approach, the source
K
transmits a K layer code X =
l=1 γl Xl to the relays,
where γl represents the power allocated to the l’th layer with
rate Rl = ln 1 +

. Each relay decodes its

received signal from the ﬁrst layer up to the layer that its
backward-channel conditions allow and forwards them to the
destination. Afterwards, each relay ampliﬁes and forwards the
remaining undecoded layers.
Suppose that the ﬁrst and second relays allocate portions
ξPr and ζPr of their power to the decoded layers, respectively.
Also, assume that the ﬁrst and second relays respectively decode M and N layers out of the K transmitted layers. Without

for −10dB ≤ Pr ≤ 60dB and Ps = 0dB. It can be seen from
the curves that AF scheme outperforms DF scheme of [9] in
terms of throughput for Pr > 20dB, and in terms of expectedPs
rate for Pr > 30dB, with lower complexity. As shown in ﬁg. 3,
Ps
DF and AF are both outperformed by the proposed DAF. Note
that the rates are expressed in nats. Figure 3 shows that when
the ratio of the relay power to the source power is low, the
obtained upper-bound is tight. Note that non of the proposed
relaying strategies meets the upper-bound when the ratio of the
relay power to the source power is high. The reason is that the
obtained upper-bounds are based on full cooperation between
the relays (see ﬁg. 2). Therefore the ﬁst hop in the upperbound model is stronger than that of the proposed schemes
of the network, while thanks to distributed space-time codes,
their second hop have the same ability. When the ratio of the
relay power to the source power is high, the ﬁrst hop causes
a real bottleneck, in which the upper-bound model is stronger
than the proposed schemes.

VII. C ONCLUSION
The main goal of the paper is to propose simple, efﬁcient,
and practical relaying schemes to increase the average achievable rate at the destination in dual-hop parallel relay networks
with Rayleigh block fading links and uninformed transmitters.
To this end, a hybrid decode-amplify-forward relaying scheme,
in conjunction with the broadcast approach, were proposed.
The maximum achievable throughput and expected-rates of
this scheme and also the ON/OFF based amplify-forward
relaying strategy were derived and numerically compared with
two obtained upper-bounds.

respectively.
The cutset-bound of the network results in a closed form
expression, however is looser than the above upper-bound. Due
to space limitations, we only summarize the results below.
Proposition 2 The cutset-bound of expected-rate in the parallel relay network is speciﬁed by
