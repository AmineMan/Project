Speciﬁcally, we propose and study a precode-and-forward
scheme which improves on our previous work [1], [12].
An ordinary zero-forcing relaying with and without network
coding was proposed in [12] to maximize the sum rate under
a fairness requirement. The ZF scheme eliminates interference
at the expense of elevated noise, which degrades the throughput performance, especially for ill-conditioned channels or
low SNR communication. The MMSE precode-and-forward
scheme strikes a balance between noise and interference. The
MMSE precoder and receive ﬁlter are studied for singlehop transmission in [13]. MMSE relaying schemes were
investigated in [8], [11], in which MMSE precoders at the
relay are used to minimize the sum MSE of all the users.
In contrast, in this paper we introduce receive ﬁlters at the
users and show that joint optimization of the relay precoder
and the receive ﬁlters can yield signiﬁcantly better MSE
results. In addition, we show how network coding can be
introduced into the MMSE system to further improve the MSE
and throughput performances. Simulation results show that
the network-coded MMSE relaying improves the throughput
performance over the existing ZF/MMSE relaying schemes
noticeably with moderate complexity increase.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section
II introduces the background of wireless MIMO switching. In
Section III, the ordinary and network-coded MMSE relaying
schemes are proposed. Section IV presents the simulation
results. The paper is concluded by Section V.

Abstract— A wireless relay which forms a one-to-one mapping
from the inputs (uplinks) to the outputs (downlinks) is called
a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) switch. The MIMO
switch carries out precode-and-forward, where all users send
their signals in the uplink and then the MIMO switch precodes
the received vector signal for broadcasting in the downlink.
Ideally, each user employs a receive ﬁlter to recover its desired
signal from one other user with no or little interference from
other users. We propose a joint design of the precoder and
the receive ﬁlters to achieve the minimum-mean-square-error
(MMSE), assuming full channel state information is available at
the relay. Our results indicate that the proposed MMSE relaying
scheme outperforms the existing ZF/MMSE schemes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
This paper investigates the throughput performance of a
wireless MIMO switching network [1], in which a multiantenna relay helps multiple single-antenna users communicate with one another. We explore two minimum mean
square error (MMSE) relaying schemes: MMSE relaying with
and without network coding. We show that compared with
the existing zero-forcing (ZF)/MMSE relaying schemes, both
of our proposed MMSE schemes achieve better MSE and
throughput performances.
Two-way relaying has been extensively investigated in recent years (see, e.g., [2]–[4]). By applying physical-layer network coding (PNC) [5], two half-duplex nodes can accomplish
bidirectional information exchange in two phases with the
help of a half-duplex relay. Much of the current interest is
on general multi-way relay serving multiple users. Capacity
bounds for the multi-relay channel where the relay has a
single antenna has been developed in [6]. So far, the trafﬁc
patterns studied include pairwise data exchange [6]–[8], where
the users form pairs to exchange data within each pair, and full
data exchange, where each user broadcasts to all other users
[6], [9]–[11]. In contrast, the trafﬁc pattern studied in this
paper is arbitrary unicast, where the mapping from senders
to receivers can be an arbitrary permutation, which is more
general than pairwise exchanges.

II. S YSTEM D ESCRIPTION
Consider K users, numbered 1, . . . , K, each with one
antenna, as shown in Fig. 1. The users communicate via a
relay with N antennas and there is no direct link between
any two users. In this paper, we focus on the pure unicast
case, in which each user transmits to one other user only.
The collection of unicast patterns can be used to realize any
general trafﬁc ﬂow pattern (unicast, multicast, broadcast, or
a mixture of them) among the users by scheduling a set of
different unicast trafﬁc ﬂows.1
Each transmission consists of one uplink symbol interval
and one downlink symbol interval. In particular, the two
symbol intervals are two slots in a time-division system.

This work was partially supported by grants from the Univ. Grants Committee of the Hong Kong, China (AoE/E-02/08; 414911); the State Key Lab of

1 Similarly, in order to accomplish full data exchange, multiple slots are
required in [9]–[11].

then P x = [x3 , x1 , x2 ]T . In the case where all diagonal
elements of P are zero it is also called a derangement. The
precoder G realizes a particular permutation represented by
the permutation matrix P . Note that a symmetric permutation, i.e., P = P T , realizes a pairwise data exchange. By

Wireless MIMO switching.

The objective of the MMSE relaying scheme is to minimize
the sum MSE between the received signals after detection and
the transmit signals. In the following, we introduce the design
of the detector C and the precoder G.

The uplink symbol interval is for simultaneous uplink transmissions from the users to the relay; the downlink symbol
interval is for downlink transmissions from the relay to the
users. We assume the two intervals are of equal duration.
Each round of uplink and downlink transmission realizes a
switching permutation, as described below.
Consider one transmission. Let x = [x1 , · · · , xK ]T be
the vector representing the signals transmitted by the users.
Let y = [y1 , · · · , yN ]T be the received signals at the relay,
and u = [u1 , · · · , uN ]T be the noise vector with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise samples following
circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution,
i.e., un ∼ Nc (0, γ 2 ). Then
y = Hx + u,

C is diagonal,

(6c)

where (6b) is the constraint of relaying power consumption.
Unfortunately, the problem is nonconvex, making it difﬁcult
to solve both G and C directly. However, we notice that we
can solve the two variables in an iterative manner. That is, we
can iteratively optimize one variable by somehow ﬁxing the
other one until convergence to a local optimum.
The iterative formulas can be determined using the Lagrangian function, which is written as

(1)

(2)

J = E P x − Cr

where w is the noise vector at the receiver, with the i.i.d. noise
samples following CSCG distribution, i.e., wk ∼ Nc (0, σ 2 ).
We assume the detector at the users is C, where C is diagonal
since the users are distributed.

r = Cr.

Given a desired permutation P , the optimization problem for
determining the optimal precoder and ﬁlter is formulated as

where H is the uplink channel gain matrix. The relay multiplies y by a precoding matrix G before relaying the signals.
In this paper, we assume that the uplink channel and downlink
channel are reciprocal, i.e., the downlink channel is H T . Thus,
the received signals at the users in vector form are
r = H T Gy + w = H T GHx + H T Gu + w,

HH H + γ 2 I.

For the network-coded MMSE relaying, we permit the selfinterference to exist at the side of receivers. Then the selfinterference can be canceled from the denominator of the SNR
in the sum rate (4). As we proposed earlier in [12], we deﬁne a
diagonal matrix B to denote the weights of self-interference.
We will show that by proper design of B, the throughput

Lemma 1: The MSE of both the non-PNC and the PNC
schemes converge as the number of iterations increases.
Proof: For both the non-PNC and PNC scheme, the MSE
decreases monotonically as the number of iteration increases.
Together with the MSE being non-negative, we conclude that
the MSE converges toward a local optimum.

Observation 1: The proposed MMSE relaying schemes have
better MSE performance than the MMSE schemes in [8], [11].
The MSE performance is evaluated in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4.
The sum MSE of the MMSE scheme [8], [11] saturates at
high SNR, since they optimize the precoders at the relay only.
In contrast, we jointly optimize both the precoder at the relay
and the detectors at the users, thus our MSE keeps decreasing.
Importantly, the MSE can be further decreased by network
coding. Comparing the MSE of different number of users, we
see that the sum MSE increases as the number of users grows.

IV. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the MSE and the throughputs
of the proposed MMSE relaying schemes. We assume the
maximum transmit power of the relay is the same as that of
each user, i.e., q = 1, and the noise levels at the relay and the
users are the same. Our simulations yield essentially the same

Observation 2: The proposed network-coded MMSE relaying
scheme generally has better throughput performance than the
relaying schemes in [1], [8], [11], [12].

We compare our proposed relaying schemes with the ZF
schemes in [1], [8], [11], [12], the MMSE scheme in [8], [11]
and the network-coded schemes in [11], [12]. The throughput
performance is evaluated in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5. For non-PNC
schemes, the proposed non-PNC MMSE scheme has similar
throughput performance as the MMSE scheme in [8], [11], and
they both outperform the non-PNC ZF schemes in [1], [11].
The effect of the receive ﬁlter C in throughput performance
is not obvious. By joint optimization with C, the optimal B
and G are different from that in the case without C. The gain
is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5.
The throughput performance can be further improved by
network coding. In particular, our proposed network-coded
MMSE scheme outperforms our prior network-coded ZF relaying scheme as well as the network-coded scheme in [11].
Summing up the gains induced by MMSE and network coding, the network-coded MMSE relaying scheme can achieve
around 5 dB gain over the traditional ZF/MMSE schemes.
In addition, when the number of users grows, the sum rate
increases; however, the average rate decreases. Note that the
gap between network-coded ZF and MMSE schemes is trivial
when N = 2. The reason is that the loss due to zero-forcing
disappears after adding B when N = 2, i.e., there is no zero
element in P + B. However, when N > 2 the MMSE scheme
achieves larger gain over the ZF scheme since the latter forces
some elements in P + B to be zero.

Observation 3: The complexities of the network-coded
schemes are close to the non-PNC schemes. The MMSE
schemes have higher complexity than the ZF schemes.
As mentioned in Remark 1, we initialize the precoders with
the ZF results proposed in [1], [12]. The iteration stops when
the throughput improvement is smaller than 10−3 . To evaluate
the complexity of our proposed schemes, we ﬁrst evaluate
the numbers of iterations required for our proposed MMSE
schemes to achieve convergence. Fig. 6 indicates that with
the ZF result initialization, the number of iterations decreases
as SNR increases, or as the number of users decreases. The
network-coded schemes have faster convergence, but little additional complexity in terms of the number of multiplications
needed, as shown in Fig. 6. The comparison results of the
numbers of multiplications and additions are similar, thus we
show the ﬁgure of multiplication only.
We remark that for implementation, the optimization computation itself can be performed solely at the relay, with the
computed detectors’ gains C and the self-interference weights
B conveyed to the users. Since both C and B are diagonal,
the amounts of data to be conveyed are not large.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed two MMSE relaying
schemes in the wireless MIMO switching, i.e., a general
multi-way relay channel. The schemes, especially the networkcoded scheme has substantially better MSE and throughput
performances than the existing ZF/MMSE relaying schemes.
