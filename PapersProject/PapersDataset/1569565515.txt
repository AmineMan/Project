Example 2. Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p with q
elements. Let {|x | x ∈ Fq } denote an orthonormal basis of
the vector space Cq with respect to the usual hermitian inner
product. For a, b in Fq , we can deﬁne unitary operators X(a)
and Z(b) by

Abstract—Nice error bases are a fundamental primitive of
quantum information processing. For example, they govern the
discretization of errors in quantum error-correcting codes. It
is show that the generalized Pauli basis, the most widely used
example of nice error bases, has some remarkable structural
properties. However, the generalized Pauli basis is limited to
dimensions that are a power of a prime, since it is constructed
with the help of a ﬁnite ﬁeld. A wider class of nice error bases
is introduced that shares many features of the generalized Pauli
basis, yet allows one to remove the restriction to prime power
dimensions. The nice error bases are indexed by nearrings.
Nearrings that support the construction of nice error bases
are called nice. It is shown that all ﬁnite nearﬁelds are nice.
It is shown that a ﬁnite ring is nice if and only if it ﬁnite
Frobenius ring. Several fundamental properties of nice nearrings
are established.

X(a)|x = |x + a ,

where tr denotes the absolute trace of the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq to
its prime subﬁeld. The set B = {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ Fq } forms
the generalized Pauli basis. This is a nice error basis that is
indexed by the additive group (F2 , +).

Of course, Example 2 contains Example 1 as a special case.
Furthermore, the basis elements are often multiplied with some
phase factor, but such a change is of course inconsequential.
Are further examples of nice error bases known? Yes, in
fact, all nice error bases with an abelian index group have been
classiﬁed [7]. Even all nice error bases with small nonabelian
index groups are known. Yet, the Examples 1 and 2 dominate
the applications of nice error bases. This prompts the question:
What makes the error bases given in Examples 1 and 2 so
special?
Let us investigate some of the properties of the generalized
Pauli basis. The elements of this basis are of the form
X(a)Z(b) with a, b in Fq . The operator X(a) induces a
permutation of the basis states

I. I NTRODUCTION
A fundamental primitive in quantum information processing
are nice error bases [8], [7]. They govern the discretization of
errors in stabilizer codes [1], [4], [5], subsystem codes [2],
[10], and other classes of quantum error-correcting codes [9].
Nice error bases found applications in the construction of
mutually unbiased bases [3], teleportation and dense coding
schemes [14].
A nice error basis E is a set of unitary d × d matrices D(g)
parametrized by a ﬁnite group G, called the index group, such
that
• D(1) is the identity matrix,
†
• the trace Tr(D(g) D(h)) is zero for all g, h of G with
g = h, where D(g)† denotes the Hermitian transpose of
the matrix D(g),
• the product of two matrices in E is contained in E up to
multiplication with a scalar factor, that is D(g)D(h) =
w(g, h)D(gh) for some complex scalar w(g, h).
The essence of this deﬁnition is that E is an orthogonal basis
with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product on the vector
space of complex d × d matrices, and it has the additional
feature that any product of the matrices in E is again a matrix
in E up to a scalar multiple.
It will be instructive to look at two examples of nice error
bases.

X(a)|x = |x + a ,
so this action is determined by the additive group (Fq , +)
of the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq . On the other hand, the operator Z(b)
exploits the multiplicative structure of the ﬁnite ﬁeld,
Z(b)|x = exp(2πi tr(bx)/p)|x ,
where the product bx determines the phase factor. Now let us
examine the phase factors in more detail. We deﬁne for each
b in Fq a function
χb (x) = exp(2πi tr(bx)/p).
In other words, the functions χb form the phase factors in
Z(b)|x = χb (x)|x . Then the set {χb | b ∈ Fq } consists
precisely of all additive irreducible characters of Fq , see [11,
Theorem 5.7].
The characters relate the additive and multiplicative structure of the ﬁeld, since all additive characters can be derived
from the generating character χ(x) = χ1 (x) by multiplying
the argument of χ with a ﬁxed ﬁeld element b, namely

Example 1. A well-known example of a nice error basis is
the Pauli basis
{X a Z b | a, b ∈ F2 }

χb (x) = χ(bx)
holds for all b and x in Fq .
Even though the situation might appear to be typical for
ﬁnite ﬁelds, we will boldly axiomatize the properties that we
have discovered in the preceding example. In fact, we will use
a ﬁnite set N with an addition + and multiplication operation
· and a character χ of (N, +) such that the set

where F2 is the ﬁnite ﬁeld with two elements, and X and Z
are the Pauli matrices given by
X=

and Z =

Z(b)|x = exp(2πi tr(bx)/p)|x ,

In this case, the index group G is given by the additive group
G = F2 × F2 .

Proposition 3. If {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ N } is a nice error basis
then we necessarily have that
(a) the character χ is a linear and irreducible,
(b) (N, +) is an abelian group,
(c) (N, ·) is a left reductive semigroup,

forms a nice error basis, where
X(a)|x = |x + a ,

Z(b)|x = χ(bx)|x .

We tried to impose few restriction on the addition and mulipliation operations. By inspecting the need for quantum errorcorrection, we were led to consider the case where (N, +, ·)
has the structure of a nearring.

Proof:
(a) The elements of a nice error basis are unitary operators,
hence preserve the norm of a vector. The vector Z(b)|0 =
χ(b0)|0 = χ(0)|0 is of unit norm if and only if χ is a
character of degree 1. Therefore, we can conclude that
χ(0) = 1 must hold, which proves claim (a).
(b) A nice error basis consists of a set of pairwise traceorthogonal matrices. By the previous lemma and part (a),
the set of characters {χb | b ∈ N } is a set of |N | distinct
linear irreducible character. These are all irreducible characters of (N, +), since the sum of their degrees squared
equals |N |. Therefore, (N, +) must be an abelian group.
(c) Seeking a contradiction, suppose that (N, ·) is not left
reductive. This means that there must exist two distinct
elements a, b in N such that ax = bx holds for all x in
N . However, then χa = χb , even though these characters
are supposed to be orthogonal by the previous lemma.

II. N ICE N EARRINGS
In this section, we introduce a data structure that supports
the construction of nice error bases. These nice error bases are
indexed by ﬁnite nearrings instead of a ﬁnite ﬁelds, yet the
construction very closely resembles the case of ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Not all ﬁnite nearrings can be used for this purpose. We
introduce the class of nice nearrings that allow one to construct
nice error bases. Furthermore, we establish basic properties of
such nearrings.
A set N that is equipped with an addition operation + and
a multiplication operation · such that
(a) (N, +) is a (not necessarily abelian) group,
(b) (N, ·) is a semigroup,
(c) and the left-distributive law x(y + z) = xy + xz holds for
all x, y, z in N ,
is called a (left) nearring. We will consider only ﬁnite nearrings. For some background on nearrings, see e.g. [12], [13].
Let N be a ﬁnite nearring with q elements, {|x | x ∈ N }
an orthonormal basis of Cq . For a, b in N , we can deﬁne the
operators
X(a)|x = |x + a ,

Let us call a ﬁnite nearring nice if and only if there exists
a character χ such that {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ N } is a nice error
basis.
A nice nearring has signiﬁcantly more structure than a
general ﬁnite nearring. For example, we note the following
consequence of the previous proposition.

Z(b)|x = χ(bx)|x ,

where χ is a character of (N, +).
For a function χ on N and a nearring element b in N , let
us denote by χb the function χb (x) = χ(bx) for all x in N .

Corollary 4. Let N be a nice nearring. Then N is an abelian
nearring, that is, (N, +) is an abelian group.
We should emphasize that in an abelian nearring, the multiplication operation might not be commutative. In fact, we will
see later that there exist nice nearrings with non-commutative
multiplications. The point of the previous corollary is that the
addition operation is commutative in nice nearrings.
Let us explore some more properties of nice nearrings. Let
N be a left nearring. It follows from the left-distributive law
that x0 = 0 holds for all x in N . On the other hand, in
a left nearring 0x is not necessarily 0. A nearring is called
zero-symmetric if and only if 0x = 0 holds for all x in N .
Obviously, it can be quite cumbersome to work with nearrings
that are not zero-symmetric. The next proposition shows that
nice nearrings behave well with respect to the multiplication
by 0.

Lemma 1. Let N be a left nearring. If χ is a character of
(N, +), then χb is a character of (N, +).
Proof: Let D be a representation of the group (N, +)
affording the character χ. The left distributive law of N yields
D(b(x + y)) = D(bx + by) = D(bx)D(by). So x → D(bx)
is a representation of (N, +) affording the character χb .
We call two complex d × d matrices A and B traceorthogonal if and only if Tr(A† B) = 0.
Lemma 2. The matrices in {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ N } are pairwise trace-orthogonal if and only if the characters {χb | b ∈
N } are pairwise orthogonal.
Proof: For a, b, a , b in N , we have that the trace
Tr((X(a )Z(b ))† X(a)Z(b)) is equal to



0
if a = a





χ(b x)χ(bx) = χb | χb

Proposition 5. A nice nearring is zero-symmetric.
Proof: Let N be a nice nearring. A nearring N can be
written in the form

if a = a .

N = N0 + Nc

x∈N

where N0 = {x ∈ N | 0x = 0} is the zero-symmetric
subnearring of N , and Nc = {0x | x ∈ N } is the constant
subnearring. An element in N0 ∩ Nc must be equal to 0.

Our claim follows immediately.
A multiplicative semigroup (N, ·) is called left reductive if
and only if ax = bx for all x in N implies that a = b.

2

For x in Nc , we have χb (x) = χ(x) for all b in N . Hence
there must be some b such that χb is the trivial character, so
χ(x) = 1. Therefore, x lies in the kernel of all characters
χb of (N, +). In a nice nearring, the characters {χb | b ∈ N }
coincides with the set of all irreducible characters, so x must
be 0. Therefore, we can concude that Nc = {0} and thus
N = N0 .
A nearring does not need to have a multiplicative identity,
since (N, ·) is only assumed to be a semigroup but not
necessarily a group. An element e in N such that en = n
holds for all n in N is called a left identity of N . Similarly,
an element e in N such that ne = n holds for all n in N is
called a right identity of N . Our next goal is to show that a
nice nearring contains a unique left identity.
Let us introduce some more notation. For any subset S of
a nearring N , let

that are nice. Furthermore, we characterize all nice nearrings in
an even broader class of nearrings, the so-called distributively
generated ﬁnite nearrings. Finally, we show that any ﬁnite
nearﬁeld is nice.
An element d of a nearring N is called distributive if and
only if
(x + y)d = xd + yd
holds for all x, y in N . A nearring N is called distributively
generated if and only if its set of distributive elements generate
the additive group (N, +). Obviously, any distributive nearring is distributively generated, but there exist distributively
generated nearrings that are not distributive. We are going to
characterize all distributively generated nearrings that are nice.
We will recall some terminology from the theory of rings and
their modules for this purpose.
Let R be a ring. A left R-module I is called injective if
and only if for any monomorphism g : A → B of left Rmodules and any homomorphism h : A → I there exists a
homomorphism h : B → I such that h = h ◦ g. In other
words, the following diagram of R-modules commutes:

Ann(S) = {a ∈ N | an = 0 for all n ∈ S}
denote the left annihilator of S.
An element a in a nearring N is called a left zero divisor
if and only if there exists an element b in B such that ab = 0.

Proposition 6. A nice nearring contains a unique left identity.

Proof: Seeking a contradiction, we assume that N is a
nice nearring that does not contain a left identity.
Suppose that the left annihilator Ann(N ) contains a nonzero
element b. By Proposition 5, a nice nearring is zerosymmetric;
thus, χb (x) = χ0 (x) = χ(0) = 1 for all x in N . However, it
is impossible that the characters χ0 and χb coincide, since N
is by hypothesis a nice nearring. Therefore, the left annihilator
Ann(N ) must be equal to {0}.
We claim that in a ﬁnite nearring without left identity and
Ann(N ) = {0}, every element must be a left zero divisor.
Indeed, if there would exist an element a in N that is not a left
zero divisor, then bN would have to coincide with N . In other
words, left multiplication by a would be an automorphism
of (N, +). This would imply that there exists an exponent k
such that left multiplication with ak induces the identity map
on (N, +). However, this is impossible, since we assumed that
N does not contain a left identity. Therefore, we can conclude
that every element of N must be a left zero divisor.
Since N is a nice nearring, there must exists a nonzero
element a in N such that χa = χ. As a is a left zero divisor,
there must exist a nonzero element b such that ab = 0. In
other words, bN is contained in the kernel of χ. However,
this would imply that the kernel of χb is N , and therefore
the character χb would have to coincide with χ0 , which is
impossible in a nice nearring. It follows that N must contain
a left identity.
The uniqueness of the left identity follows from Proposition 3 (c).

A ring R is called left self-injective if and only if the left
R-module R R is injective. By a result of Baer a ring R is left
self-injective if and only if any homomorphism from a left
ideal J can be extended to a homomorphism from R to itself.
A ring is called a quasi-Frobenius ring if and only if it is
a left-noetherian and left self-injective ring. Equivalently, we
could have deﬁned a quasi-Frobenius ring as a right-noetherian
right self-injective ring. Thus, the apparent dichotomy between
left and right in the deﬁnition of a quasi-Frobenius ring is
irrelevant.
Let M be a left R-module over a ring R. The socle
soc(M ) of the module M is deﬁned as the sum of all
minimal submodules of M . The Jacobson radical rad(M ) of
the module M is deﬁned as the intersection of all maximal
submodules of M . The Jacobson radical rad(R) of a ring R
is deﬁned as rad(R) = rad(R R).
An artinian ring R is called Frobenius if and only if it is
quasi-Frobenius and soc(R R) = R (R/rad R). For example,
a) Any semisimple ring is a Frobenius ring.
b) Let R be a Dedekind ring and J a nonzero ideal, then R/J
is a Frobenius ring.
c) In particular, Z/nZ is a Frobenius ring for all integers
n > 1.
d) Let k be a ﬁeld and G a ﬁnite group. Then the group ring
kG is a Frobenius ring.
Theorem 7. A distributively generated nearring is nice if and
only if it is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring.

III. C LASSIFICATION
Recall that a nearring allows one to construct a nice error
basis resembling the form of the generalized Pauli basis if and
only if it is nice. In this section, we characterize all ﬁnite rings

Proof: A ﬁnite Frobenius ring is evidently a distributively
generated nearring. Moreover, a ﬁnite Frobenius ring has

3

a generating character, see [6], [15]. Thus, it follows from
Lemma 2 that a ﬁnite Frobenius ring is nice. Therefore, we
can conclude that a ﬁnite Frobenius ring is a nice distributively
generated nearring.
Conversely, let N be a distributively generated nice nearring. By Proposition 6 it contains a unique left identity.
Any distributively generated nearring with unique left identity
must have an identity, see [13, Theorem 6.7(b)]. By Proposition 3 (b), N is abelian. A distributively generated abelian
nearring is a ring []. However, a ring is nice if and only if it
is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring.

Theorem 8. Any ﬁnite nearﬁeld is nice.
Proof: Let N be a ﬁnite nearﬁeld. For elements a, b in
N , we can deﬁne a map a,b : N → N by a,b (x) = ax − bx.
This map is injective when a and b are distinct elements.
Indeed, seeking a contradiction, suppose that x and y are
distinct elements in N such that a,b (x) = a,b (y), then
a(x − y) = b(x − y); since nearﬁelds are cancellative, this
would imply a = b, contradicting the fact that a and b must
be distinct.
Let χ be a nontrivial character of (N, +). Seeking a
contradiction, suppose that χ is not a generating character.
Then there exist distinct a, b in N such that χa = χb . In other
words, χ(ax) = χ(bx) must holds for all x in N . Multiplying
with χ(−bx), we obtain χ(ax − bx) = χ( a,b (x)) = 1 for all
x in N . Since a,b is an injective function, this means that all
elements of N must be in the kernel of χ, but this contradicts
the fact that χ is a nontrivial character.
IV. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we introduced a class of nice error bases that
forms a very natural generalization of the generalized Pauli
basis. The error bases are formed by exploiting the additive
and multiplicative structure of nice error bases. We called
nearring nice if and only if it is capable to support such a
nice error basis. We have shown that any nice nearﬁeld is a
nice nearring. Furthermore, we have shown that a ring is nice
if and only if it is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring. More generally, we
have been able to determine which distributively generated
ﬁnite nearrings are nice.
In applications to quantum error-correction codes, one can
form nice error bases by tensoring them. In the homogeneous
case, where a nice error bases is tensored with itself n
times, one can characterize which pairs of matrix elements
commute in terms of a character that contains as an argument
a difference dot products, just as in the case of the generalized
Pauli group. The error bases that have been introduced here
were designed with a view toward such applications in coding
theory. The advantage is that one can now work in any
dimension, not just in dimensions that are a power of a prime.
