Beyond the Bethe Free Energy of LDPC Codes via
Polymer Expansions

for bounds and [9], [10] for results on the binary erasure
channel. In [11] it is proven that correlations between pairs
of distant (with respect to Tanner graph distance) bits decay
exponentially fast for LDGM codes in the regime of large
noise, and LDPC codes in the regime of small noise. This
also allowed to conclude that the replica symmetric formulas
are exact in these regimes.
A few years ago Chertkov and Chernyak [12] developed
a loop series representation for the free energy of graphical
models. The virtue of this representation is that it isolates the
Bethe contribution, and represents the remainder by a series of
terms involving only BP messages associated to generalized
loops of the graph. It is tempting to use this representation as
a tool to compare the true and Bethe free energies.
In this contribution we consider regular LDPC(l, r) codes
used over a highly noisy BSC, where (l, r) stands for the
degree of variable node and check node respectively. Con1
sider the conditional entropy n H(X|Y ) of the input word
X = (X1 · · · Xn ) given a channel output Y = (Y1 · · · Yn ).
We prove that in the large size limit, with high probability
with respect to the code ensemble, the difference between
the conditional entropy and the Bethe formula tends to zero.
The error term essentially comes from the probability that
the graph is not locally tree-like. Our techniques also allow
to organize the dominant correction terms into a polymer
expansion2 involving generalized loops of size less than λ0 n
(0 < λ0 < 1 a constant). As we will show, expander arguments
imply that this polymer expansion converges uniformly in n.
When the terms of the polymer expansion are added to the
Bethe expression, with high probability, the difference with
the conditional entropy becomes O(e−nϵ ) for some ϵ > 0.
Our results also apply to more general models. Namely
the channel could have asymmetric ﬂip probability. In fact
the whole technique and results apply to spin-glass models
on (l, r) Tanner graphs with l odd and l < r, with small
magnetic ﬁelds, and any temperature.The limitation to l < r
is not just technical. Indeed l > r would correspond to a
kind of XORSAT constraint satisfaction problem, and for the
usual XORSAT problem we know that the replica symmetric
solutions are not generally exact at low temperatures.
The case l = 2 (cycle codes) has its own special features
and has been discussed in [14].

Abstract—The loop series provides a formal way to write
down corrections to the Bethe entropy (and/or free energy) of
graphical models. We provide methods to rigorously control such
expansions for low-density parity-check codes used over a highly
noisy binary symmetric channel. We prove that in the asymptotic
limit of large size, with high probability, the Bethe expression
gives an exact formula for the entropy (per bit) of the input
word conditioned on the output of the channel. Our methods
also apply to more general models.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Often one needs to compute the free energy and/or entropy
of a graphical model. The Bethe approximation and the related
Belief Propagation (BP) equations may sometimes offer a good
starting point. However it is seldom a controlled approximation
and even worse it is usually not clear if it yields upper or lower
bounds, or even if there is any such relationship. There are not
many results that precisely pinpoint the relation between the
Bethe and true free energies or entropies. A general result of
Vontobel [1] relates the Bethe free energy to an average of the
true free energy over all graph covers. For Ising-like graphical
models with attractive pair interactions, Wainwright [2] has
shown that, under additional special conditions, the Bethe free
energy is a bound to the true free energy. This has been
extended recently to a much wider setting (with “attractivelike” interactions) by Ruozzi [3]. For counting independent
sets in sparse graphs with large girth, Chandrasekaran et al. [4]
show that the Bethe free energy is asymptotically exact as the
size of the graph grows. Works [2], [4] use the same loop series
used here. It is well known that the Bethe free energy is exact
on trees, and it is natural to investigate its possible exactness
on random Erdoes-R´ nyi type graphs which are known to
e
be locally tree-like. But we already know of systems, such
as random constraint satisfaction models (e.g, K-SAT or Qcoloring) or spin glasses, where the true free energy is not
given by the Bethe formula - even when averaged over the
graph ensemble. The local tree-like nature of the graph is not
sufﬁcient when long ranged correlations are present [5].
For graphical models that describe communication with low
density parity-check (LDPC) and low density generator-matrix
(LDGM) codes over binary-symmetric memoryless channels
the situation is favorable. Indeed we have plenty of evidence
that the replica-symmetric solution1 is exact. See [6], [7], [8]
1 Replica-symmetric formulas are averaged forms of the Bethe formulas,
where the average is over the channel output realizations and code ensemble.

II. P RELIMINARIES
We begin with a few deﬁnitions and notations. Fix two
integers l < r. Consider two vertex sets: V a set of n variable
l
nodes and C a set of m = n r check nodes. We think of n
large and l, r ﬁxed. We consider bipartite (l, r) regular graphs
- call them Γ - connecting V and C. The set of edges is E.
More precisely, vertices of V have degree l, vertices of C have
degree r, and there are no double edges. The set of all such
graphs is denoted B(l, r, n). Note that Γ is the Tanner graph
of a LDPC code with design rate 1 − l/r. When we say that Γ
is random we mean that we draw it uniformly randomly from
the set B (l, r, n). The corresponding expectation is EΓ .
Letters i, j will always denote nodes in V and letters a, b
nodes in C. We reserve the notations ∂i (resp. ∂a) for the sets
of neighbors of i (resp. a) in Γ.
We will say that Γ is a (λ, κ) expander if for every subset
V ⊂ V such that |V| < λn we have |∂V| ≥ κl |V|. Here
∂V is the number of check nodes that are connected to V.
Take a random Γ. We can always ﬁnd λ > 0 such that with
probability 1 − O(n−(l(1−κ)−1) ), Γ is a (λ, κ) expander with
κ < 1 − 1 . It is sufﬁcient to take 0 < λ < λ0 where λ0 is the
l
positive solution of the equation3

III. T HE B ETHE A PPROXIMATION
The Bethe free energy involves a set of messages
{ηi→a , ηa→i } attached to the edges of Γ. The collection of
all messages is denoted (η, η). These satisfy the BP equations
{
∑
ηi→a = hi + b∈∂i\a ηb→i
(∏
)
ηa→i = tanh−1 j∈∂a\i tanh ηj→a .
These equations always have a trivial solution tanh ηi→a =
tanh ηa→i =1. We will consider only non-trivial solutions that
are relevant for small h. For these solutions ηi→a and ηa→i
take small values and we can show that |ηi→a | ≤ |h| + (l −
1)|h|r−1 + O(|h|r ) and |ηa→i | ≤ |h|r−1 + O(|h|r ). We call
such solutions high-noise-solutions.
These solutions have a Bethe free energy

As will be seen later we need to take κ ∈]1 − 2(r−1) , 1 − 1 [

(which is always possible for r > 2). In the rest of the paper
κ is always a constant in this interval, and 0 < λ < λ0 . For
concreteness, one can take the case (l, r) = (3, 6), ﬁx κ = 1/2
and λ0 = 5 × 10−4 .
Assume that we transmit (with uniform prior) code words
from an LDPC code with Tanner graph Γ over a BSC with ﬂip
probability p. We assume without loss of generality that the all
zero codeword is transmitted. Then the posterior probability
that x = (xi )n ∈ {0, 1}n is the transmitted word given that

output and use (5) to relate the true and Bethe entropies.
IV. L OOP C ORRECTIONS TO THE B ETHE A PPROXIMATION
We deﬁne a generalized loop g as any subgraph contained
in Γ with no dangling edges (ﬁgure 1). Note that a generalized
loop is not necessarily connected and can be the empty set.
We call di (g) (resp. da (g)) the induced degree of node i (resp.
a) in g. For a generalized loop we have di (g) ∈ {2, · · · , l}
and da (g) ∈ {2, · · · , r}.
For a ﬁnite size system, the loop series [12] is an identity
valid for any solution of the BP equations. We have

It is good to keep in mind that the high noise regime considered in this paper corresponds to small h (p close to 1/2) and
that |hi | = h.

connected parts γ1 and γ2 .

The sum on the right hand side carries over all generalized
loops included in Γ. The K(g) can be expressed entirely in
terms of BP messages ηi→a and ηa→i . The explicit formula
is given in the appendix. Remarkably K(g) factorizes in a
product of contributions associated to the connected parts of
g. Each generalized loop can be decomposed in a unique way
as a union g = ∪k γk where γk are connected and disjoint
generalized loops. The γk ’s are called polymers. We have

The second term on the right hand side of (11) is the

The third sum is over the set GM of all connected Mayer
graphs G with M vertices labeled by γ1 , ..., γM (see ﬁgure
2). Note that in the expansion of the logarithm, the indicator
function forces the polymers to overlap. Therefore the summations contains an inﬁnite number of terms and its convergence
has to be controlled.
Lemma 1: Suppose r > 2. Fix ζ0 > 1 and replace K(γ)
by ζK(γ) (ζ ∈ C) in the polymer expansion (12) which then
becomes a power series in the parameter |ζ| ≤ ζ0 . Assume
that Γ is a (λ, κ) expander with κ ∈]1 − 2(r−1) , 1 − 1 [. One
lr
l
can ﬁnd h0 > 0 such that for |h| < h0 this power series is
absolutely convergent uniformly in n and h.
Remark 3: This lemma holds for any (l, r) with r > 2.
Remark 4: Our real interest is of course for ζ = 1, and the
introduction of the parameter ζ above is just a convenient way
to describe the nature of the polymer expansion. This lemma
forms a crucial part for the proofs of theorems 1 and 2.
Remark 5: The last term in the right hand side of (11)
contains the contributions of large polymers of size greater
than λn (in a sea of small polymers). It turns out that this
contribution cannot be expanded into an absolutely convergent
series, and has to be treated non-perturbatively by counting
methods.
Lemma 1 has the following consequence:
Corollary 1: Suppose r > 2. One can ﬁnd h0 > 0
independent of n such that for |h| < h0 ,

In the sum each γk runs over all polymers contained in Γ. The
1
factor M ! accounts for the fact that a polymer conﬁguration
has to be counted only once. Finally the indicator function
ensures that the polymers do not intersect (it equals 1 when
M = 0, 1). Because of this constraint all sums in (9) are ﬁnite.
From a physical point of view (9) is the partition function
of polymers that can acquire any shape allowed by Γ, have
activity4 K(γ), and interact via a two body hard-core repulsion. This analogy allows us to use methods from statistical
mechanics to analyze the corrections to the Bethe free energy.
We say that a polymer is small if |γ| < λn for some ﬁxed λ
that we take in the interval [0, λ0 ]. The contribution of small
polymers to (9) is

If we take the expectation over graphs we cancel the sum
over z ∈ V ∪ C and the n−1 . This allows to consider
a sum of polymers rooted at one vertex. We compute this
expectation by conditioning on the ﬁrst event that Γ is treelike in a neighborhood of size O(ln n) around this vertex,
and on the second complementary event. The second event
has small probability O(n−(1−β) ) for any 0 < β < 1.
Besides from (21) and (15) it is easy to show that n−1 | ln Zp |
is bounded. For the ﬁrst event we have that the smallest
polymer is a cycle with |γ| = O(ln n). This with (21) and
(15) implies that n−1 | ln Zp (η, η)| ≤ n−β| ln |h|| . Combining
all these remarks with the fact that Γ is an expander with
probability 1 − O(n−(l(1−κ)−1) ) we obtain (13).

(15)

then the result follows for h small enough.
The main difﬁculty in proving (15) is that the (optimal)
estimate (34), (35) in the Appendix shows that K(γ) is not
necessarily very small for graphs containing too many check
nodes of maximal induced degree and too many variable nodes
of even induced degree. More precisely for these bad graphs
the activity is not exponentially small in the size of the graph.
Then it is not possible to compensate for the ”entropy” of the
graph.
We will use an expander argument to show that these bad
cases do not occur when |γ| < λn. We derive (15) with

In this section we deal with the contribution R(η, η) corresponding to terms containing at least one large polymer in
(9). We have
∑
K(g) = Zp (η, η) + R(η, η),
(22)

In the process of this derivation one has to require 3 − l(1 −
κ) > 0 and c > 0. This imposes the condition on the expansion
constant κ > 1 − 2(r−1) . Note that an expansion constant
lr
cannot be greater than 1 − 1/l, so it is fortunate that we have
1 − 1 > 1 − 2(r−1) (for any r > 2).

Now we sketch the proof of (15) and (16). Recall that di (γ)
(resp. da (γ)) is the induced degree of node i (resp. a) in γ. The
type of γ is given by two vectors n = (ns (γ))l
s=2 and m =
(mt (γ))r deﬁned as ns (γ) := |{i ∈ γ ∩ V |di (γ) = s}| and
t=2
mt (γ) := |{a ∈ γ ∩ C|da (γ) = t}|. In words, ns (γ) and
mt (γ) count the number of variable and check nodes with
induced degrees s and t in γ. Note that we have the constraints

The expectation of the number of g ⊂ Γ with prescribed
type can be estimated by combinatorial bounds provided by
McKay [15]. It turns out that these subgraphs proliferate
exponentially in n only for a subdomain of ∆ where K (n, m)
is exponentially much smaller in n. In the subdomain where
K (n, m) is not small (but it is always bounded) the number
of subgraphs is subexponential when l is odd and l < r. As
a consequence for l odd and l < r, we are able to prove that
the sum on the right hand side of (25) is smaller than e−Cn .
Unfortunately our estimates break down for l even.

This already proves theorem 2.
It is now easy to show theorem 1. There is a probability
O(n−(l(1−κ)−1) ) that this last term is not small. However we
can always show it is bounded by a constant independent of n.
Indeed it is equal to the difference n−1 ln Z − fBethe (η, η) −
n−1 ln Zp (η, η) where each term separately can be shown to
be bounded by a constant independent of n. Furthermore,
corollary 1 tells us that the expectation of the absolute value
of the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s is O(n−(l(1−κ)−1) ). Combining
these remarks allows to conclude the proof of theorem 1.
