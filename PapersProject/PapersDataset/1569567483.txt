Abstract—A basic trade-off between spatial and frequency
diversities available for communication with multiple scattered
waves is presented. A rigorous notion of the total number
of space-frequency degrees of freedom of the ﬁeld is introduced based on Slepian’s theory of spectral concentration of
L2 functions. This deﬁnition agrees with the “rule of thumb”
of multiplying the degrees of freedom available in space and
frequency. However, while the mathematical deﬁnition requires
both frequency and spatial bandwidths to scale simultaneously, a
physical argument precludes such a scaling to occur in practice.
Hence, since the nature of wireless communication prevents
unbounded and simultaneous spatial and frequency diversity
gains, rule of thumb deﬁnitions of degrees of freedom should
be taken with care as they are inherently imprecise.

freedom is limited by the wavelength-normalized size of the cut.

The performance of any wireless communication system is
ultimately dictated by the underlying electromagnetic wave
propagation process. Electromagnetic signals, as functions of
space and time, are characterized by both spatial and frequency
degrees of freedom that can be exploited for communication.
Spatial degrees of freedom have been the subject of intense
investigations in the context of multiple antenna systems
(MIMO) and ad-hoc wireless networks. Since the ﬁrst MIMO
experiments performed at Bell Laboratories in the late nineteen
nineties [1], it was clear that multiple scattering, providing
signal’s spatial diversity through multi-path propagation, can
enhance the throughput of the system. Theoretically, it was
predicted that the Shannon capacity of MIMO systems could
scale linearly with the number of antennas in certain physical
propagation conditions providing independence of channel
gains between transmitters and receivers [2], [3]. However,
it has also been pointed out that in the presence of correlated
fading performance can decrease substantially [4], [5], [6].
More recently, the physical limits of the number of spatial
degrees of freedom and of the information capacity of spatially
distributed MIMO systems have been considered by a number
of authors [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
[17]. These limits are universal, in the sense that hold in
any propagation conditions and do not depend on speciﬁc
assumptions on the channel gains, correlations structure, etc.
The main result of all of these works is that the number
of spatial degrees of freedom is physically limited by the
size of the radiating system. In particular, for large radiating
systems, the size of a wavelength-normalized cut enclosing
all the transmitters limits the number of spatial degrees of
freedom available for communication [8], [9], see Figure 1
for a pictorial representation of this limitation. The upper

bound can theoretically be achieved in a speciﬁc scattering
environment by distributing uniformly in space a large number
of small cylindrical elements that provide diffusive scattering
in all directions [17] 1 .
All of the above works refer to narrowband frequency transmission over a single carrier frequency channel. This paper
aims at characterizing the physical limits of communication
when multiple frequency channels are used. On the one hand,
it seems natural to assume that in the presence of two frequencies, the total number of available degrees of freedom would
scale as r(ω1 +ω2 ), because for each frequency the number of
spatial degrees of freedom is proportional to the wavelengthnormalized quantity r ωi , and there are two frequency channels
available for transmission. On the other hand, it is natural to
ask whether eventually there is a fundamental limit on the joint
scaling of space and frequency that prevents the total number
of degrees of freedom to continue growing as r i ωi , as both
r and the number of frequency channels are increased.
It turns out that the nature of wireless communication
prevents unbounded and simultaneous spatial and frequency
diversity gains. Our argument proceeds in two steps. First, we
show that a rigorous deﬁnition of the total number of degrees
of freedom that coincides with the intuitive notion of taking the
product of the spatial times frequency diversities can only be
valid in an asymptotic sense where both r and the frequency
1 Although the results in [17] are for systems of ﬁxed size, these reduce to
the upper bound in [8] in the scaling limit of large radiating systems.

bandwidth used for transmission grow simultaneously. Then
we argue, using a simple theoretical model of rich multiple
scattering from point obstacles radiating in all directions, that
such a simultaneous scaling is not possible: an environment
increasingly rich of spatial degrees of freedom necessarily
leads to poor frequency diversity and vice-versa.

as it makes the degrees of freedom a principal feature of the
mathematical model of the real world of transmitted signals,
that is practically insensitive to small changes of a secondary
feature of the model, such as the accuracy of the measurement
apparatus with which the signals are detected, see [22] for a
through discussion of this point.
The above shows that for strictly bandlimited signals the
number of degrees of freedom is essentially given by the
Nyquist number N0 = ΩT /π. When signals are not perfectly
bandlimited a triangular inequality can be used [23]. Letting
A ⊂ S a subspace of signals not necessarily bandlimited,
we have
(8)
dn (A ) ≤ DBΩ (A ) + dn (BΩ ),

NUMBER OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM

In the context of physics, the number of degrees of freedom
is deﬁned as the minimum number of parameters sufﬁcient to
describe the evolution of a system within a given precision. In
analogy to the physical deﬁnition, a mathematical deﬁnition in
the context of squre integrable signals can be given as follows.
Consider the space S of L2 signals of total energy

f 2 (t)dt ≤ 1,

where
DBΩ (A ) = sup inf ||f − g||.

(1)

f ∈A g∈BΩ

Notice that, in contrast to the ﬁrst term, the second term in
(8) depends on Ω. Hence, in order to bound the degree to
which general signal spaces can be approximated by ﬁnitedimensional subspaces, a typical technique is to project the
space A onto BΩ and then determine the error associated to
this projection. This error is then added according to (8) to
the approximation error given by the Kolmogorov n-width of
the corresponding bandlimited projection. We elucidate this
technique in the context of electromagnetic signals below.

Given a level of accuracy > 0, deﬁne the number of degrees

where dN (BΩ ) is the Kolmogorov n-width [18] of the space
BΩ . N (BΩ ) represents the dimension of the minimal subspace representing the elements of BΩ within accuracy in the
interval (−T /2, T /2). A basic result in approximation theory
(see e.g.[18, Th. 2.5]) states that
dN (BΩ ) =

Letting N0 = ΩT /π, we have that for n
N0 most of the
eigenvalues are close to one, while for n
N0 most of them
are nearly zero. As N0 gets large, it is well known [19], [21]
that the exact width of the n-interval of the transition increases
as log N0 . More precisely, for any > 0 if

then we have limN0 →∞ λn (N0 ) < . It then immediately
follows that according to our deﬁnition the number of degrees
of freedom of bandlimited signals is
N (BΩ ) = N0 + O(log N0 log 1/ ), as N0 → ∞.

SIGNALS

The general set-up developed in the previous section can
be applied to the space E of electromagnetic signals. These
are functions space and time, deﬁned in the domain provided
by their initial and boundary conditions. A suitable mathematical representation is the L2 space of square-integrable
functions, so that they admit a Fourier spectral representation.
Occasionally, the space E can be extended to include Dirac
δ-distributions to model, for example, idealized concentrated
sources, such as point charges and line currents.
The electric ﬁeld on the whole space-time is represented by
superposition of angular frequency components as

where λN is the N -th eigenvalue (arranged in non-increasing
order) of the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind
arising from Slepian’s concentration problem [20]

It follows that we can deﬁne the natural space-time
(r, t) domain, the partial spectral space-frequency (r, ω)
and wavenumber-time (k, t) domains, and the full spectral
wavenumber-frequency (k, ω) domain. The ﬁeld representations in these domains are e(r, t), E(r, ω), e(k, t), E(k, ω).

Notice that the dependence of the degrees of freedom from
is weak, in the sense that it grows only as log 1/ , making the
effective dimensionality of the space practically independent
of the accuracy of the approximation. This is very desirable,

so that dn (BW ) can also be made arbitrarily small as N0 =
(2πrω/c) → ∞. We conclude that letting the wavelengthnormalized size of the circular cut tend to inﬁnity, (17)
corresponds to the number of spatial degrees of freedom
N (E ) of the ﬁeld. This result was determined in [23], [24] in
the context of electromagnetics and in [8], [9] in the context
of information theory. In addition, in [8, Sec. III-B] it has
been shown that this number of degrees of freedom does not
increase in the presence of scattering objects placed outside
the cut-set. The argument essentially being that the external
scatterers do not add new spatial channels because the circular
cut already captures all ﬁeld paths coming out of the sources.

The four ﬁeld representations linked by Fourier transforms.

On the circular cut in Figure 1 the space-frequency ﬁeld
E(r, ω) can also be represented as E(s, ω), using a scalar
arc-length coordinate s normalized to the radius r. Hence, the
Fourier transform pairs linking the four ﬁeld representations
are in this case the ones depicted in Figure 2.

B. Total Space-frequency degrees of freedom
When instead of a single angular frequency ω transmission
occurs over a range of frequencies Ω, an asymptotic notion
of total number of space-frequency degrees of freedom can
be introduced that relies on the same concentration arguments
given for the single-dimensional case. Let U, S be two measurable sets in R2 and consider the subspaces of signals whose
natural (s, t) domain is supported in U and those whose full
spectral (w, ω) domain is supported in S. These will play the
role of the timelimited and bandlimited signals considered in
Section II, extended here to two-dimensional sets in spacetime and wavenumber-frequency. We let

A. Spatial degrees of freedom
For any given angular frequency ω, since the ﬁeld E(s, ω)
is observed over a ﬁnite interval for s ∈ (−π, π), its spaceFourier transform E(w, ω) must have an unbounded support
in the variable w. Let us consider the bandlimitation error in
terms of deviation DBW from the space BW of functions of
bounded support W . According to the deﬁnition given in (9)
we have
DBW (E ) = sup inf ||f − g||.
(14)

T (U ) = {f ∈ S : f (s, t) = 0 x ∈ U }

A main result of [23] ensures that, in absence of scatterers
external to the cut, letting W0 = ωr/c, the bandlimitation
error DBW (E ) is close to one for W
W0 and close to
zero for W
W0 . The exact width of the W -interval of the
1/3
transition increases sublinearly as W0 . More precisely, for
any > 0 if
1/3

W = W0 + O(W0

(log 1/ )2/3 )

(15)

Theorem 1. The total number of degrees of freedom at level
of the space of ﬁelds E is bounded as
N T ot (E ) = O(Ω0 W0 2πT ) = O(r2 ) as r → ∞.

(16)

=

N0 + O(N0 (log 1/ )2/3 ) + O(log N0 (log 1/ ))

=

N0 + O(N0 (log 1/ )),

where the eigenfunctions ψn ∈ T (U ) are mutually orthogonal
and complete, and the eigenvalues measure their concentrations in S. By a result in [25, Th. 2], letting S = rQ for ﬁxed
Q and r → ∞, the number of eigenvalues above scales as

N + O(log N (log 1/ ))

=

1/3
1/3

(20)

Proof sketch: The proof requires setting up the appropriate eigenvalue equation analogous to (5), and showing
that concentration can occur by scaling both dimensions of
(either one) of the two sets S and U simultaneously. Letting
TU and BS be orthogonal projections onto T (U ) and B(S)
respectively, it is not too hard to show that the generalization
of equation of (5) to the case at hand is given by the operator
equation
TU BS TU ψn (s, t) = λn ψn (s, t)
(21)

that is space-limited to the interval s ∈ (−π, π) and almost
bandlimited to the interval w ∈ (−W0 , W0 ). Using (8) with
the change of variables A → E , Ω → W , we can ensure that
the Kolmogorov n-width dn (E ) < , by ensuring that both
DBW (E ) and dn (BW ) are less than /2. This can be done by
ﬁrst choosing W as in (15) so that DBW (E ) can be arbitrarily
small as W0 = (ωr/c) → ∞. Then, letting N = (W 2π)/π
and N0 = (W0 2π)/π we choose
n

(19)

The total number of space-frequency degrees of freedom is
related to the total bandwidth in the (w, ω) domain, so we need
to determine to what extend this total bandwidth concentrates
around the support S.
Let Ω0 = rΩ for any ﬁxed Ω = |ωM − ωm | > 0, and
W0 = rW for any ﬁxed W = ωm /c. Let S be the rectangle
Ω0 × W0 and U be the rectangle 2π × T .

then we have limW0 →∞ DBW (E ) < .
We can now apply the general set-up developed in section II
to determine the number of spatial degrees of freedom of the
ﬁeld. We have the Fourier transform pair
E(s, ω) ↔ E(w, ω),

our context, letting Q = Ω × W , this means
lim N T ot (E )/r2

(22)

and the result now follows.
A few remarks are in order. We have shown that in order
to obtain a scaling of the total number of degrees of freedom as the product of the frequency times the wavenumber
bandwidths, one needs to scale the two bands at the same
rate. This can be accomplished by scaling the radius of the
radiating system, so that the wavenumber bandwidth concentrates at the scale of the radius as shown in Section III-A,
and simultaneously scaling the frequency bandwidth at the
same rate. For the careful reader, an important point of the
proof that requires some attention and might not be evident
from the sketch presented above, is that since the wavenumber
bandwidth depends on the frequency ω, the domain S is
really a trapezoid. Having chosen to scale the bandwidth W0
corresponding to the smallest frequency ωm , we discarded the
right-most and left-most triangles of the trapezoid so that S
becomes a rectangle. This, of course, does not change the
scaling behavior of the result.

Given the mathematical results outlined above, it is of
interest to ask whether it is physically possible to have a joint
scaling of the frequency and the wavenumber bandwidths so
that the upper bound in Theorem 1 is achievable. The work
in [17] shows that the largest amount of spatial diversity occurs
in an environment where small scattering elements diffuse
the electromagnetic ﬁeld uniformly in all directions. Next, we
use a simple multiple scattering model of wave propagation
developed in [26], [27] to show that in the case of a uniform
distribution of point scatterers that radiate uniformly in all
directions, the frequency diversity decreases with increasing
clutter. Thus, there appears to be a trade-off between the spatial
diversity provided by a cluttered environment and the cut-off
of the high frequency bands due to the spreading behavior of
the diffusive channel.

Figures 4 and 5 show plots of the impulse response (23) for
α = 1. Larger spreads are observed for increasing values of η
and r. This suggests that the spreading nature of the channel,
providing richer multi-path spatial diversity, also eventually
works as a low-pass frequency ﬁlter decreasing the frequency
diversity.
Taking the Fourier transform of (23), expanding the exponential function in a Taylor series around R2 − r2 = 0, and
integrating term by term changing the integration variable to
u = R/r and using the integral in [28, identity 3.387.3], we
obtain that the expected transfer function H(r, ω) is given by

In [26] a simple model of multiple scattering based on
the theory of random walks has been proposed. The model
has been successively reﬁned in [27] to study propagation
of impulse waveforms in cluttered environments and it has
been shown capable to closely track real electromagnetic pulse
propagation data. The model considers successive random
reﬂections of photons in the environment. The photons are
initially concentrated at the source and then spread in the
environment following random trajectories, see Figure 3. At
each collision with an obstacle, a photon can be absorbed
with probability α, or scattered uniformly in a random direction with probability (1 − α). For the postulated uniform
distribution of scatterers, the photon’s path length in between
