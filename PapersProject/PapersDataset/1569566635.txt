and energy utilization of the network. Finally, we provide
concluding remarks in Section VI.

Abstract—Random Access Compressed Sensing (RACS) is an
efﬁcient method for data telemetry from a network of distributed
sensors deployed in a challenging ﬁeld environment with limited
resources. RACS relies on integrating sensing with the communication architecture, in order to achieve overall efﬁciency in
terms of the energy per bit of information successfully delivered
to the fusion center. Targeting realistic deployment conditions, we
consider data gathering over a Ricean fading channel and in the
presence of communication noise. We provide a framework for
system design and study the energy and bandwidth requirements
of the network. We then show that compared to a conventional
TDMA network with ARQ, RACS achieves signiﬁcant energy and
bandwidth savings. For example, for a network of 4000 nodes, we
observe 10 dB gain in the energy as well as a 2.5-fold reduction
in the required bandwidth.

II. RACS: R ANDOM ACCESS C OMPRESSED S ENSING
The theory of compressed sensing [4], [5] establishes that if
a signal of dimension N has an S-sparse representation in an
appropriate domain Ψ (referred to as the sparsity basis), it can
be recovered, with very high probability, from O(µS log N )
random measurements obtained in a sensing domain Φ.1 Many
natural signals have a compressible (sparse) representation in
the frequency domain. Noting that the spatial coordinate basis
and the spatial frequency basis are maximally incoherent,2 the
conditions for compressed sensing hold.
RACS thus works as follows: The sensor node i, where
i ∈ {1, . . . , N }, measures the signal of interest at random time
instants (e.g., following a Poisson packet generation model),
independently of the other nodes, at a rate of λ1 measurements
per second. It then encodes each measurement along with
the node’s location tag into a packet of L bits, which is
transmitted to the FC over a fading and noisy random access
channel. Combining random sensing with random channel
access provides a simple scheme that is easy to implement and
does not require synchronized scheduling. At the FC, a packet
is declared erroneous if it does not pass the cyclic redundancy
check (CRC) or a similar veriﬁcation procedure. Motivated by
compressed sensing, the FC discards the erroneous packets,
since it does not care which speciﬁc sensors are selected as
long as (i) the selected subset is chosen uniformly at random,
and (ii) there are sufﬁciently many correct packets collected
to allow for the reconstruction of the ﬁeld. The FC collects
the successfully received packets over an observation interval
T , where T is assumed to be shorter than the coherence time
of the process, such that the process can be approximated as
ﬁxed during the observation interval. Among the successfully

I. I NTRODUCTION
Long-term monitoring of the natural environment is facilitated by the advances in the wireless sensor technology [1],
which enable the deployment of a large number of inexpensive
sensors. The data from distributed sensors is conveyed to a
fusion center (FC) where a full map of the sensing ﬁeld is
reconstructed. This task is exacerbated in harsh environments
that demand that the power be saved to prolong network
life-time, bandwidth is constrained, and the communication
channel introduces distortion. An efﬁcient scheme thus calls
for the integration between sensing, communication, and ﬁeld
recovery. In [2], [3] we proposed Random Access Compressed
Sensing (RACS) which achieves overall efﬁciency in terms
of the energy per bit of information successfully delivered.
Considering the fact that most natural phenomena have a
sparse representation in an appropriate domain, RACS capitalizes on integrating compressed sensing with random channel
access. The former supports transmission of sensor data from
only a random subset of all the nodes– thus reducing the
overall energy consumption– while the latter supports a simple
implementation that eliminates the need for synchronized
scheduling. In the present paper, we address the design and
performance of RACS under realistic deployment conditions,
including fading and noisy communication channels.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we overview the principles of RACS. In Section III, we
address the impact of channel fading and communication
noise on the system performance. Section IV outlines the

that packet arrivals follow a Poisson distribution, we have that

received packets, there may be more than one packet corresponding to a single node. Considering that the sensing ﬁeld
has not changed, the extra packets, if successfully received, are
redundant. Thus some of the received packets at the FC may be
repetitive, while some are corrupted due to the communication
noise and interference. To reconstruct the map of the ﬁeld, the
FC recovers the sparse vector v which represents the Fourier
transform of the ﬁeld, by solving
minv

In the worst case scenario, the packet arrivals are synchronized, i.e., τi = 0 for i ∈ {1, . . . , N }. Thus the interfering
n
power is denoted by In = i=1 |hi |2 P0 = Yn , and follows
a probability distribution fY . This, however, represents a pessimistic scenario, since in RACS packet transmissions are not
synchronized. Rather than considering various scenarios for
the overlapping of packets, we employ a simpliﬁed model in
which we assume that the strongest interferer dominates in (t),
i.e., we assume that the interference power is In = |hm |2 P0 ,
where hm = maxi∈{1,...,n} hi . Assuming Mn = |hm |2 P0 has
a probability distribution fM , it can be shown that

III. C HANNEL FADING AND N OISE
We consider a random access network consisting of a total
of N sensor nodes, where each node generates packets with
an average rate of λ1 packets/sec, and transmits the generated
packet immediately to the FC. The wireless channel gain ci ,
observed by the i-th packet, can be modeled as
(3)

where the effects of distance-dependent path loss and the
shadowing are included in a gain Gi , and small-scale fading
is modeled by a complex-valued coefﬁcient hi ∼ CN (¯ 1).
h,
Assuming that the data collection interval T is short compared
to the de-correlation interval of the shadowing, the shadowing
coefﬁcient is considered ﬁxed and can be estimated using
an occasional downlink feedback. Thus we assume that Gi
can be pre-compensated at the transmitter by means of a
power control mechanism, i.e., that the transmitter adjusts its
power to P0 /G2 , where P0 is the desired average received
i
power. We assume a quasi-static fading model, in which the
fading coefﬁcients hi remain ﬁxed for the duration of a packet
and change independently from one packet to the next. This
assumption implies that the packets generated by a single node
are distanced sufﬁciently apart in time such that they undergo
independent fades. Also, the spatial correlation among the
channels is assumed to be negligible.

The effects of coding, modulation and other system parameters are implicit in b, which is a predeﬁned threshold

Model (a) assumes the worst case scenario, thus leads to an
overestimation of the effect of interference and yields slightly
pessimistic results for the probability of successful reception.
Model (b), on the other hand, underestimates the effect of
the interference, resulting in a probability of success that is
slightly larger than the one predicted using model (a). The
models (a) and (b) given by (9) thus provide upper and lower
bounds, respectively, on the actual interfering power.
For a given number of interfering packets n, the probability
of successful reception ps|n (γ) is an increasing function of γ,
where the shape of the function depends on system parameters
such as modulation, coding, etc. The following two models can
be used to describe ps|n (γ):
1) Outage Model: In this model, ps|n (γ) is described by a
step function as

where u0 (t) is the desired signal, in (t) is the interference
and w(t) is the additive white Gaussian noise with power
N0 B, where B is the bandwidth. The interfering term can
be expressed as
in (t) =

(8)

where FX (x) is the CDF of X0 .
Thus we have two methods to model the interfering power,

A. Probability of Successful Reception
The received signal at the FC is given by
vn (t) = h0 u0 (t) + in (t) + w(t)

(6)

where Tp = L/B is the packet duration.3 For a given node,
X0 = |h0 |2 P0 represents the power of the desired packet,
and In represents the total interference power. We assume
that X0 and In follow probability distributions fX and fI ,
respectively. The instantaneous signal to interference and noise
ratio is given by

C. Numerical Results
We start by examining the impact of the choice of the
threshold b in the outage model given by (10). The proper
choice of b depends on the modulation and coding techniques
used. Fig. 1 depicts the probability of successful reception
using both the BER and the outage models for various
scenarios. We observe that for a non-coded scheme we can
adopt a threshold value b = 6, while the outage model with
b = 2 corresponds to employing a code with a large coding
gain, and ﬁnally b = 4 lies in between. For the rest of this
paper, we employ the outage model with a threshold b = 4.
Fig. 2 shows the probability of successful reception in
Rayleigh fading (K = 0) using the two models (a) and (b) for
interference given by Eq. (9). As expected, model (b) predicts
a larger ps than model (a). We note that for our choice of
system parameters, the bounds on ps , provided by models (a)
and (b), are tight, and the gap further diminishes as bandwidth
is increased. Thus the actual ps is approximated relatively
accurately by each model. Throughout the rest of the paper
we use model (a) and design the system for the worst case
scenario, keeping in mind that the actual system performance
will be slightly better than assumed by this model.
Fig. 3 shows ps in a Ricean fading channel for K = 3
and K = 6 dB. We observe from the ﬁgure that in the
noise-limited scenario (γ0 very small) and in the interferencelimited scenario (γ0 very large) channel fading boosts the
probability of successful reception. The reason is that when
fading is present, not every collision has to result in packet
loss. Namely, it is possible that although two (or more) packets
overlap at the FC, one is sufﬁciently stronger so that it can be
successfully detected.

B. Ricean and Rayleigh models
As a general model for a wireless communication channel,
we assume that the amplitudes of the channel gains |hi | follow
i.i.d Ricean distribution where the rice factor K is deﬁned as
the ratio of the power in the line of sight (LOS) component
to the power in the scattered component. In the special case
when there is no LOS component present, i.e., K = 0, the
envelope of hi follows a Rayleigh distribution. In this case,
X0 follows an exponential distribution given by
fX (x) =

Cg = Rdf ree /2 is the asymptotic coding gain, df ree is the minimum

We deﬁne the probability of sufﬁcient sensing as the probability that the FC collects Ns or more useful packets during T ,
where Ns = CS log N is speciﬁed by compressed sensing (C
is a constant). We then specify the performance requirement
as the minimum probability of sufﬁcient sensing, Ps . Thus,
the design criterion is expressed as
λ =

where the bounds are within a constant gap of size e.
To further demonstrate the advantage of RACS, we compare
the energy and bandwidth requirements of RACS with those
of a conventional (benchmark) design. The benchmark scheme
is a TDMA network in which all N nodes transmit using
pre-assigned time slots. In the presence of noise and fading,
some of the packets are not successfully received. A common
approach to deal with the packet loss is to employ an automatic
repeat request (ARQ) scheme, by which the receiver requests
retransmission of a failed packet. The average number of
retransmissions required to ensure a packet is successfully

received is 1−pf , where pf denotes the probability of failure
for a packet and is given by

(21)

The condition (21) can equivalently be stated as

(25)

where η = E{G−2 }. We note that the energy expenditure

Emin depends on the transmission bandwidth B through λ1s ,
where λ1s (B) is largest when B = Bs , and decreases with
B. Thus we determine lower and upper bounds on the energy
consumption as

K(λ1 , T ), is the number of received packets left after discarding the erroneous and repetitive packets. The probability
of receiving a useful packet from a node can be expressed
as [12]

Random access compressed sensing (RACS) is an energyefﬁcient approach to data gathering over large-scale sensor
networks. By combining random sensing with a simple random
access, RACS eliminates the need for synchronized scheduling
(as is required for deterministic channel access methods such
as TDMA), thus making it easy to implement over a large
network. To address realistic deployments for RACS, we took
into consideration the impact of channel fading and noise on
the design and performance of the network. It was shown
that in the noise-limited and the interference-limited scenarios,
fading boosts the probability of successful reception. We
assessed the performance of RACS analytically in terms of the
energy and bandwidth utilization. We observe signiﬁcant gains
in energy and bandwidth over a TDMA network using ARQ.
For example, for a network of 4000 nodes, we achieve 10 dB
saving in energy as well as lower bandwidth requirements.
