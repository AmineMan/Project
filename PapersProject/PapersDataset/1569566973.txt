Abstract—In this paper we construct a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the problem where a set of users is
interested in gaining access to a common ﬁle, but where each
has only partial knowledge of the ﬁle. We further assume the
existence of another set of terminals in the system, called helpers,
who are not interested in the common ﬁle, but who are willing
to help the users. Given that the collective information of all
the terminals is sufﬁcient to allow recovery of the entire ﬁle,
the goal is to minimize the (weighted) sum of bits that these
terminals need to exchange over a noiseless public channel in
order achieve this goal. Based on established connections to the
multi-terminal secrecy problem, our algorithm also implies a
polynomial-time method for constructing the largest shared secret
key in the presence of an eavesdropper. We consider the following
side-information settings: (i) side-information in the form of
uncoded packets of the ﬁle, where the terminals’ side-information
consists of subsets of the ﬁle packets; (ii) side-information in the
form of linearly correlated packets, where the terminals have
access to linear combinations of the ﬁle packets; and (iii) the
general setting where the the terminals’ side-information has an
arbitrary (i.i.d.) correlation structure. We provide a polynomialtime algorithm (in the number of terminals) that ﬁnds the optimal
rate allocations for these terminals, and then determines an
explicit optimal transmission scheme for cases (i) and (ii).

Fig. 1. An example of the data exchange problem with helpers. A base station
has a ﬁle formed of four packets w1 , . . . , w4 ∈ Fqn and wants to deliver it to
two users over an unreliable wireless channel. Additionally, there is a terminal
in the system that is in the range of the base station, but he is not interested
in the ﬁle. However, he is willing to help the two users to obtain the ﬁle.
The base station stops transmitting once all terminals collectively have all the
packets, even if individually they have only subsets of the packets. They can
then cooperate among themselves to recover the users’ missing packets. If the
goal is to minimize the total number of communicated bits, helper transmits
packet w1 + w3 , while user 2 transmits packet w4 , where the addition is in
the ﬁeld Fqn .

An example of such a setting is shown in Figure 1,
where a base station wants to deliver the same ﬁle to multiple geographically-close users over an unreliable wireless
downlink. We assume that some terminals, which are in the
proximity of the users, are not interested in the ﬁle, but
are able to overhear some of the base station transmissions.
Moreover, we assume that these terminals are willing to help
in distributing the ﬁle to the interested users. Henceforth, we
refer to these terminals as helpers, and the terminals interested
in the ﬁle as users. In the example of Figure 1 we assume that
the ﬁle consists of four equally sized packets w1 , w2 , w3 and
w4 belonging to some ﬁnite ﬁeld Fqn . Suppose that after a
few initial transmission attempts by the base station, the three
terminals (including one helper) individually receive only parts
of the ﬁle (see Figure 1), but collectively have the entire ﬁle.
Now, if all terminals are in close vicinity and can communicate
with each other, then, it is much more desirable and efﬁcient,
in terms of resource usage, to reconcile the ﬁle among users
by letting all terminals “talk” to each other without involving
the base station. The cooperation among the terminals has the
following advantages:
• Local communication among terminals has a smaller
footprint in terms of interference, thus allowing one
to use the shared resources (code, time or frequency)
freely without penalizing the base station’s resources, i.e.,
higher resource reuse factor.
• Transmissions within the close group of terminals is
much more reliable than from the base station to any

I. I NTRODUCTION
In recent years cellular systems have witnessed signiﬁcant improvements in terms of data rates, and are nearly
approaching the theoretical limits in terms of the physical
layer spectral efﬁciency. At the same time, the rapid growth in
the popularity of data-enabled mobile devices, such as smart
phones and tablets, and the resulting explosion in demand
for more throughput are challenging our abilities to deliver
data, even with the current highly efﬁcient cellular systems.
One of the major bottlenecks in scaling the throughput with
the increasing number of mobile devices is the “last mile”
wireless link between the base station and the mobile devices –
a resource that is shared among many terminals served within
the cell. This motivates the study of paradigms where cell
phone devices can cooperate among themselves to get the
desired data in a peer-to-peer fashion without solely relying
on the base station.

terminal due to geographical proximity of terminals.
This cooperation allows for the ﬁle recovery even when
the connection to the base station is either unavailable
after the initial phase of transmission, or it is too weak
to meet the delay requirement.
The problem of reconciling a ﬁle among multiple wireless
users having parts of it while minimizing the cost in terms of
the total number of bits exchanged is known in the literature
as the data exchange problem and was introduced by El
Rouayheb et al. in [1]. In the problem formulation of the
data exchange problem it is assumed that all the terminals
in the system are interested in recovering the entire ﬁle, i.e.,
there are no helpers. For this problem randomized algorithms
were proposed in [2] and [3], while deterministic polynomial
time algorithms were proposed in [4], [5]. In [6], [7] and
[8] the authors used a combinatorial approach, to solve this
problem, which exploited the fact that the constraint set in
the corresponding optimization problem forms a submodular
base-polyhedron. For the problem considered in this paper,
where not all terminals are interested in recovering the ﬁle,
the constraint set does not constitute a submodular basepolyhedron. As a result, here, we take a convex optimization
approach to solve the data exchange problem with helpers.
To exemplify the effect of having helpers, consider the
example from Figure 1. Let user 1, user 2 and the helper
transmit R1 , R2 and R3 bits, respectively. The objective is
to minimize the weighted sum-rate α1 R1 + α2 R2 + α3 R3
such that, user 1 and user 2 can recover the entire ﬁle. It
can be shown that for the case when α1 = α2 = α3 = 1,
the minimum communication cost is 2 and can be achieved
by the following coding scheme: user 2 transmits packet w4 ,
and the helper transmits w1 + w3 , where the addition is over
the underlying ﬁeld Fqn . This corresponds to the optimal rate
allocation R2 = R3 = 1 symbol in Fqn . Now, if there was no
helper in the system, it would take a total of 3 transmissions
to reconcile the ﬁle among the two users. That is user 1 has to
transmit w3 and user 2 transmits w1 and w4 . Thus, the helpers
can contribute to lowering the total communication cost in the
system.
The discussion above considers only a simple form of sideinformation, where different terminals observe partial uncoded
“raw” packets of the original ﬁle. Content distribution networks are increasingly using coding, such as Fountain codes
or linear network codes, to improve the system efﬁciency [9].
In such scenarios, the side-information representing the partial
knowledge gained by the terminals would be coded and in the
form of linear combinations of the original ﬁle packets, rather
than the raw packets themselves. The previous two cases of
side-information (“raw” and coded) can be regarded as special
cases of the more general problem where the side-information
has arbitrary correlation among the data observed by the different terminals and where the goal is to minimize the weighted
total communication cost. In [10] Csisz´ r and Narayan posed
a
a related security problem referred to as the “multi-terminal
key agreement” problem. They showed that obtaining the ﬁle
among the users in minimum number of bits exchanged over

the public channel is sufﬁcient to maximize the size of the
secret key shared between the users. This result establishes a
connection between the Multi-party key agreement and the
Data exchange problem with helpers. The authors in [10]
solved the key agreement problem by formulating it as a linear
program (LP) with an exponential number of rate-constraints,
corresponding to all possible cut-sets that need to be satisﬁed.
In this paper, we make the following contributions. First,
we provide a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for
ﬁnding an optimal rate allocation, w.r.t. a linear weighted
sum-rate cost needed to deliver the ﬁle to all users when all
terminals have arbitrarily correlated side-information. Second,
for the the data exchange problem with helpers, for raw
or linearly coded side-information, we propose an efﬁcient
communication scheme design based on the algebraic network
coding framework [11], [12].

II. S YSTEM M ODEL AND P RELIMINARIES
In this paper, we consider a setup with m terminals out of
which some subset of them is interested in gaining access to
a ﬁle or a random process. Let X1 , X2 , . . . , Xm , m ≥ 2,
denote the components of a discrete memoryless multiple
source (DMMS) with a given joint probability mass function.
Each user i ∈ M {1, 2, . . . , m} observes n i.i.d. realizations
of the corresponding random variable Xi .
Let A = {1, 2, . . . , k} ⊆ M be the subset of terminals,
called users, who are interested in gaining access to the ﬁle,
(X1 , . . . , Xm ). The
i.e., learning the joint process XM
remaining terminals {k + 1, . . . , m} serve as helpers, i.e., they
are not interested in recovering the ﬁle, but they are willing
to help users in the set A to obtain it. In [10], Csisz´ r and
a
Narayan showed that to deliver the ﬁle to all users in a setup
with general DMMS, interactive communication is not needed.
As a result, in the sequel WLOG we can assume that the
transmission of each user is only a function of its own initial
fi (Xin ) represent the transmission of
observations. Let Fi
the user i ∈ M, where fi (·) is any desired mapping of the
observations Xin . For each user in A in order to recover the
entire ﬁle, transmissions Fi , i ∈ M, should satisfy,
1

lim H(XM |F, Xln ) = 0, ∀l ∈ A,

where F (F1 , F2 , . . . , Fm ).
Deﬁnition 1. A rate vector R = (R1 , R2 , . . . , Rm ) is an
achievable data exchange (DE)-rate vector if there exists
a communication scheme with transmitted messages F =
(F1 , F2 , . . . , Fm ) that satisﬁes (1), and is such that
1
Ri = lim H(Fi ), ∀i ∈ M.

It is easy to show using cut-set bounds that all the achievable
DE-rate vectors necessarily belong to the following region
R

{R : R(S) ≥ H(XS |XS c ), ∀S ⊂ M, A ⊆ S} , (3)

where R(S)
i∈S Ri . Also, using a random coding
argument, it can be shown that the rate region R is an
achievable rate region [10].

Hence, the underlying optimization problem has the following
form

In this work, we aim to design a polynomial complexity
algorithm that delivers the ﬁle to all users in A while simultaneously minimizing a linear communication cost function
m
(α1 , · · · , αm ), 0 ≤ αi < ∞, is
i=1 αi Ri , where α
an m−dimensional vector of non-negative ﬁnite weights. We
allow αi ’s to be arbitrary non-negative constants, to account
for the case when communication of some terminals is more
expensive compared to the others, e.g., setting α1 to be a
large value compared to the other weights minimizes the rate
allocated to the user 1. This goal can be formulated as the
following linear program:

A. Finite Linear Source Model
In this section we introduce a source-model to characterize
linearly correlated side-information. The source model we use
is called Finite linear source as deﬁned in [13]. It captures
the fact that the content distribution networks using linear
codes result in terminals’ side-information to be in the form
of linear combinations of the original packets instead of
the uncoded packets, as is the case in conventional “Data
Exchange problem”.
Next, we brieﬂy describe the ﬁnite linear source model. Let
q be some power of a prime. Consider the N -dimensional
random vector W ∈ FN whose components are independent
qn
and uniformly distributed over the elements of Fqn . Then, in
the linear source model, the observation of ith user is simply
given by

Example 1. Consider a system with m = 6 terminals M =
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. For convenience, we express the underlying
T
∈ F3n , where a, b, c are
data vector as W = a b c
q
independent uniform random variables in Fqn . Let us consider
the case where each node has the following observations:
X1 = {a + b}, X2 = {a + c}, X3 = {b + c}, X4 = {a},
X5 = {b}, X6 = {c}. Let us assume that user 1 is interested in
recovering the vector W such that underlying communication
cost is 6 Ri .

It immediately follows from Algorithm 1 that a solution to

this problem is R4 = R6 = 1, and R2 = R3 = R5 = 0. In
other words, user 1 is missing 2 linear equations in order to

where Ai ∈ Fqi ×N is an observation matrix for the user i.
It is easy to verify that for the ﬁnite linear source model,

is supermodular (see [16] for the formal deﬁnition). Therefore,
optimization problem (7) is over a supermodular polyhedron
R1 . From the combinatorial optimization theory it is known
that Edmonds’ greedy algorithm [17] provides an analytical
solution to this problem (see Algorithm 1).

B. Deterministic Algorithm when |A| > 1
When |A| > 1, the set of constraints of the optimization
problem (4) does not constitute a polyhedron of a supermodular function, as it was the case when |A| = 1. The reason is
that the possible set function is not deﬁned for all subsets
of M. For that reason, in this section, we take a convex
optimization approach to solve the problem (4), where we use
the single user solution as a key building block.
First, we observe that an achievable DE-rate vector Z has to
simultaneously belong to the rate regions Rl of each individual
user l ∈ A, where

Henceforth for the ﬁnite linear source model we will use the
entropy of the observations and the rank of the observation
matrix interchangeably.
III. D ETERMINISTIC A LGORITHM
We begin this section by exploring the case when the set
A consists of only one user. Then, by using the methodology
of [14], we extend our solution to the case when the set A
has arbitrary number of users.
A. Deterministic Algorithm when |A| = 1

Rl = {R : R(S) ≥ H(XS |XS c , Xl ), ∀S ⊆ M \ {l}} . (9)

Let there be only one user interested in obtaining the ﬁle,
i.e., A = {1}. This is known as a multi-terminal SlepianWolf problem [15] for which the achievable rate region has
the following form:

Thus, the rate region R deﬁned in (3) can be equivalently
represented as
(l)

R = {Z : Zi ≥ Ri , ∀i ∈ M \ {l},
s.t. R(l) ∈ Rl , ∀l ∈ A}.

R1 = {R : R(S) ≥ H(XS |XS c , X1 ), ∀S ⊆ M \ {1}} .

Now, it is only left to compute an optimal rate allocation
w.r.t to the problem deﬁned in (4). Let R∗ and Z∗ be the
optimal rate vectors of the problems (4) and (11), respectively.
As we pointed out earlier R∗ = Z∗ , where Z∗ can be

computed from the matrix R[η] for a sufﬁciently large η, as
follows

For any given user l ∈ A, the objective function (13) of
the dual problem (12) can be computed analytically using
Algorithm 1. The optimization problem (12) is a linear program (LP) with O(m · k) number of constraints, which makes
it possible to solve it in polynomial time (w.r.t. number of
terminals). To solve the optimization problem (12) we apply
a subgradient method, as described below.
Starting with a feasible iterate Λ[0] w.r.t. the optimization
problem (12), every subsequent iterate Λ[η] can be recursively

code construction for the linear source model. For that matter,
let us consider the following example.

using Edmonds’ algorithm. Further, using the single user
solution as a building block we showed how one can solve the
more general problem with arbitrary number of users. Several
extensions are of interest. For instance, we can consider a
modiﬁcation of the original data exchange problem where
only helpers are allowed to transmit. Starting from a single
user case, it is easy to see that an achievable rate vector must
satisfy all the cut-set constraints over the helper set such that
the user is always on the receiving side of the cut. Minimizing
the weighted sum-rate cost over all achievable rate tuples can
again be done using Edmonds’ algorithm (see Algorithm 1).
Finally, extension to the multiple user case corresponds to the
weighted sum-rate minimization over all rate tuples that are
simultaneously achievable for all the users. This optimization
problem can be solved in polynomial time using the same
approach as described in Section III-B.

can be written as X1 = a + b = {a1 + b1 , a2 + b2 , a3 +
b3 , a4 + b4 }, X2 = a + c = {a1 + c1 , a2 + c2 , a3 + c3 , a4 +

this “extended” source model we have that the optimal rate

allocation is R1 = R2 = R3 = 1, R4 = R5 = R6 = 2.
Next question we need to address is how to design transmissions of each user? Starting from an optimal (integer)
rate allocation, we ﬁrst construct the corresponding multicast
network (see Figure 2). In this construction, notice that there
are several types of nodes. First, there is a super node S that
possesses all the packets. Each user in the set A plays the
role of a transmitter and a receiver, while the helpers act only
as transmitters. To model this, we denote s1 , . . . , s6 to be the
“sending” nodes, and t1 , t2 and t3 to be the receiving nodes.
To model the side-information at users 1, 2 and 3, we introduce
links (si , ti ), i = 1, 2, 3, of capacity 4, which are routing the
users’ observations to the corresponding receiving nodes. To
model the broadcast nature of each transmission, we introduce
“dummy” nodes r1 , . . . , r6 , such that the capacity of the links
(si , ri ) is the same as link capacity (ri , tj ), i = j, and is equal
∗
to Ri , ∀i ∈ M.
To solve for actual transmissions of each terminal, we apply
the algebraic network coding approach [11], with appropriately
designed source matrix A which corresponds to the sideinformation of all terminals. Finally, the network code for
the data exchange problem with helpers can be constructed in
polynomial time from the algorithms provided in [12] which
are based on a simultaneous transfer matrix completion.

In this paper, we studied the data exchange problem with
helpers. We provided a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for minimizing the weighted sum-rate cost of communication. We showed that the data exchange problem with
only one user and many helpers can be solved analytically
