applications, such as conﬂict resolution in multiple access
channel (MAC) and genotyping, non-binary tests may be used
to further reduce the number of tests. In the former example,
different non-binary values in a test correspond to different
power levels of the users, while in the latter example, they
correspond to different amounts of genetic material of different subjects. The reason that non-binary tests are extremely
important is that in applications like genotyping, tests are
very expensive so that one may be inclined to reduce the
number of tests at the expense of extracting more genetic
material. While there exists information theoretic analysis that
is applicable to the non-binary test matrices [10, Ch. 6], to
the best of the authors’ knowledge, the only attempts of nonbinary code construction relevant to group testing is limited to
a handful of papers, including [6] and [7], where constructions
are considered for an adder MAC channel.
For the new and versatile model of SQGT with Q-ary
test results and q-ary test sample sizes, Q, q • 2, we deﬁne the concept of capacity. Furthermore, we deﬁne a new
generalization of the family of disjunct codes, ﬁrst introduced
in [8], called “SQ-disjunct” codes. Similar to the family of
disjunct codes, this new code family may be decoded using a
simple, low-complexity algorithm. We conclude our exposition
with a probabilistic method for code construction, of use in
applications where the physics of the experiments prohibits
structured codes.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
the SQGT model, while Section III introduces the capacity
of SQGT. In Section IV, we deﬁne SQ-disjunct codes and
present some simple properties of these codes. In Section V,
we describe a number of constructions for SQGT codes.

Abstract—We consider a novel group testing procedure, termed
semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems
arising in genome sequence processing. Semi-quantitative group
testing (SQGT) is a non-binary pooling scheme that may be
viewed as a combination of an adder model followed by a
quantizer. For the new testing scheme we deﬁne the capacity
and evaluate the capacity for some special choices of parameters
using information theoretic methods. We also deﬁne a new class
of disjunct codes suitable for SQGT, termed SQ-disjunct codes.
We also provide both explicit and probabilistic code construction
methods for SQGT with simple decoding algorithms.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Group testing (GT) is a pooling scheme for identifying a
number of subjects with some particular characteristic – called
“positives” – among a large pool of subjects. The idea behind
GT is that if the number of positives is much smaller than the
number of subjects, one can reduce the number of experiments
by testing adequately chosen groups of subjects rather than
testing each subject individually. In its full generality, GT may
be viewed as the problem of inferring the state of a system
from a superposition of the state vectors of a subset of the
system’s elements. As such, it has found many applications in
communication theory, signal processing, computer science,
mathematics, biology, etc. (for example see [1]-[3]).
Although many models have been considered for combinatorial GT, two main models include the original model
considered by Dorfman [4] (henceforth, conventional GT)
and the adder model (also known as the adder channel or
quantitative GT) [1]. In the former case, the result of a test is
an indicator determining if there exist at least one positive in
the test (equal to 0 if no positive in the test, and 1 otherwise),
while in the latter case, the result of a test speciﬁes the exact
number of positives in that test. Motivated by applications in
genome sequence processing, we propose a novel non-adaptive
test model termed semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT).
This model accounts for the fact that in most applications a
test is not precise enough to exactly determine the number of
positives, but it is more informative than a simple indicator of
the presence of at least one positive. In other words, schemes
in which results are obtained using a test device with limited
precision may be modeled as instances of SQGT1 .
We also allow for the possibility of having different amounts
of sample material for different test subjects, which results in
non-binary test matrices. Although binary testing is required
for some applications – such as coin weighing – in other

II. S EMI - QUANTITATIVE G ROUP T ESTING
Throughout this paper, we adopt the following notation.
Bold-face upper-case and bold-face lower-case letters denote
matrices and vectors, respectively. Calligraphic letters are used
to denote sets. Asymptotic symbols such as „ and op¨q are
used in a standard manner. For an integer k, we deﬁne
rks :“ t0, 1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , k ´ 1u.
Let N denote the number of test subjects, and let m denote
the number of positives. Also, let u denote an upper bound
on the number of positives (i.e. m § u). Let Si denote the
ith subject, i P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , N u, and let Sij “ Dj be the j th
positive, j P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , mu. Furthermore, let D denote the set
of positives, so that |D| “ m. We assign to each subject a
unique q-ary vector of length n, termed the “signature” or
the codeword of the subject. Each coordinate of the signature

testing to multiple thresholds and zero gaps [5].

corresponds to a test. If xi P rqsn denotes the signature of
the ith subject, then the k th coordinate of xi may be viewed
as the “amount” of Si (i.e. sample size, concentration, etc.)
used in the k th test. Note that the symbol 0 indicates that Si is
not in the test. For convenience, we refer to the collection of
codewords arranged column-wise as the test matrix or code.
The result of each test is an integer from the set rQs.
Each test outcome depends on the number of positives and
their sample amount in the test through Q thresholds, ⌘l
(l P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , Qu). More precisely, the outcome of the k th
test, yk , equals

on the deﬁnition, it is clear that SQGT may be viewed as a

It is well-known that group testing may be viewed as
a special instance of a multiple access channel (MAC)
(e.g. see [10]). Using this connection, Malyutov [9],
D’yachkov [10], and Atia et al. [11] derived information
theoretic necessary and sufﬁcient conditions on the required
number of tests for conventional GT. It is tedious, yet straightforward, to show that the model described in [9], [10], [11]
may also be used to evaluate SQGT schemes. The main
difference in the analysis of GT and SQGT arises due to
the different forms of the mutual information used to express
the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions. We therefore focus on
characterizing the mutual informations arising in the SQGT
framework. Our notation follows the setup of [11].
Let the sample amount of each subject in each test be
chosen in an i.i.d manner from a q-ary alphabet, according
tiu

to a distribution PT . Also, let D1 and D2 be disjoint

In certain applications, ⌘ may be determined a priori by the
resolution of the test equipment. In such applications, the only
design parameter to optimize is PT . On the other hand, if one
is able to control the thresholds, ⌘ becomes a design parameter
and clearly exhibits a strong inﬂuence on the capacity of the
test scheme.

where p is the probability that a subject is present in a test.
Due to the complicated expression for the mutual information for an arbitrary distribution, a closed-form expression for
the test capacity cannot be obtained. We therefore evaluated (6)
numerically using a simple search procedure that allows us
to quickly determine a lower bound on the capacity. Fig. 2
shows the obtained lower bound on the capacity when q “ 3,
and Q “ 2 or Q “ 3. Table I shows one set of probability
distributions and thresholds achieving this bound for Q “ 3.
Table I reveals an interesting property of the quantizers
found through numerical search: there exists at least one
quantization region that consists of one or two elements
only. What this ﬁnding implies is that in order to reduce the
number of tests as much as possible, a sufﬁcient amount of
qualitative information has to be preserved. For example, by
having a quantizer that assigns the value v only to inputs of
value v, allows for resolving a large amount of uncertainty.
Furthermore, the most informative input, left unaltered after

Deﬁnition 5: A code is called a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code
of length n and size N if @s, t § u and for any sets of q-ary
codewords X “ tx1 , x2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , xs u and Z “ tz1 , z2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , zt u,
X C Z implies X Ñ Z.

Henceforth, we focus on the case where the thresholds are
equidistant. We call such codes rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct codes.
Proposition 1: A code is rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct if and only
if no codeword is included in the set of u other codewords.

Proof: It is easy to verify that if a code is rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQdisjunct, then no codeword is included in the set of u other
codewords.
Conversely, let X “ tx1 , x2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , xs u and Z “
tz1 , z2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , zt u be two sets of codewords where s, t § u.
From the assumption that no codeword is included in the set
of u other codewords, one can conclude that no codeword is
included in the set of t other codewords when t § u. If X CZ

3

but X Ü Z, then there exists a codeword xj (j P t1, 2, ¨ ¨ ¨ , su)
such that txj u Ü Z. But since txj u C X C Z, then txj u C Z,
which contradicts the assumption that no codeword is included
in t other codewords.

Theorem 2: Let the concatenated code C be as described
above. The code is capable of uniquely identifying up to u
positives.

By unique coordinate, we mean that kpiq ‰ kpjq, if i ‰ j.
Consequently, a necessary condition for the existence of a
rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code is that q ´ 1 • ⌘. As a result, there exist no binary r2; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code when
⌘ ° 1.

Proof: The proof is based on exhibiting a decoding procedure and showing that the procedure allows for distinguishing
between any two different sets of positives. The decoder is
described below.
Let y be the Q-ary vector of test outcomes, or equivalently,
the syndrome of the positives. For a rational vector z, let tzu
and xzy denote the vector of integer parts of z and fractional
parts of z, respectively. If u “ 1, decoding reduces to ﬁnding
the column of C equal to ⌘y. If u ° 1, decoding proceeds as
follows.

Step 1: Set yK “ y and form vectors yj , 1 § j § K,
using the rules:

(12)

Step 2: Identify the positives as follows: if the syndrome
of a column of Cj is included in yj , declare the subject
corresponding to that column positive. Declare the subject
negative otherwise.
The result is obviously true for u “ 1. Therefore, we focus
on the case u ° 1. First, using induction, one can prove that
each yj , 1 § j § K, is the syndrome of a subset of columns of
Cj corresponding to positives. Let C1 “ rC1 , C2 , ¨ ¨ ¨ , Cj s,
j
where 1 § j § K. Since the non-zero entries of C are
multiples of ⌘, ⌘y is the sum of columns of C corresponding
to a subset of positives. Also, the maximum value of the entries
uK´1 ´1
of C1
K´1 equals ⌘ u´1 . Since there are at most u positives,
K
´u
the maximum value of their sum does not exceed ⌘ uu´1 .
K
´1
This bound is strictly smaller than ⌘ uu´1 , the minimum nonzero entry of CK . As a result, yK is the syndrome of the
1
positives with signatures in CK , and yK´1 is the syndrome of
1
positives with signatures in CK´1 . Similarly, it can be shown
that @j, 1 § j § K ´ 1, yj is the syndrome of the positives
1
with signature in Cj , and yj´1 is the syndrome of the positives
1
with signatures in Cj´1 .
From Proposition 2, we know that each Cj is a rq; Q; ⌘; usSQ-disjunct code. Consequently using step 2, one can uniquely
identify the positives with signatures from Cj .

Proposition 2: Any code generated by multiplying a conventional binary u-disjunct code by q ´ 1, where q ´ 1 • ⌘1 , is a
rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code. As a result, the rate of the best
rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code is at least as large as the rate of
the best binary u-disjunct code with the same size and length.
Our interest in SQ-disjunct codes lies in their simple decoding procedures, of complexity OpnN q. However, one can
construct codes for SQGT using other GT codes, such as
binary u-separable codes for conventional GT [8] or codes
designed for the adder channel [12]. It can be shown that any
of these two family of codes can be multiplied by ⌘ to form
a code for SQGT.
Remark 3: The constructions described in this section reveal
the following, and highly intuitive fact: the number of individuals that may be successfully examined with Q-ary SQGT
may be as large as the number of individuals that may be
tested under the adder channel model, provided that one is
allowed to pool different amounts of sample material in each
test. In other words, the rate of adder and SGQT channels
may be the same, despite the loss of information induced by
the quantizer, provided that the alphabet size of the latter
scheme is sufﬁciently larger than the alphabet size of the
former scheme.
V. C ODE C ONSTRUCTION FOR SQGT
In what follows, we discuss two approaches for constructing
SQGT codes. For simplicity, we focus on SQGT codes with
equidistant thresholds. The ﬁrst approach relies on classical
combinatorial methods, while the second approach relies on
probabilistic methods. The second approach is of special
interest for applications such as genotyping, where one cannot
arbitrarily choose the test matrices. The tests are usually
determined by the physics of the experiment, and only certain
statistical properties of the tests are known. In this scenario,
“structure” is to be seen as probabilistic trait. We show that one
way to approach this problem is to characterize the number
of tests that ensures that almost all members of a code family
possess a given trait and act as SQGT codes.

Remark 4: The method described above can be used with any
binary separable code for conventional GT or adder channel
to generate a SQGT code.

B. Probabilistic Construction
We consider the following problem: ﬁnd a critical rate such
that any randomly generated q-ary code with rate less than the
critical rate is a rq; Q; ⌘; us-SQ-disjunct code with probability
close to one. Based on the critical rate, which depends on
the statistical properties of the process used to generate the
codes, one can identify the smallest number of tests required
to ensure that any code in the family may be used for SGGT.
