Achievable Rate Regions for the Dirty Multiple

memoryless MAC with correlated side information known noncausally at the encoders using a random binning technique.
They also considered the Gaussian doubly dirty MAC in the
high-SNR strong interference regime [10-15].The achievable
rates using Costa’s Gaussian binning vanish if both interference
signals are strong. In contrast, it is shown that lattice-strategies
(lattice pre-coding) can achieve positive rates, independent of
the interference power. Furthermore, in some cases (which
depend on the noise variance and power constraints) high
dimensional lattice strategies are in fact optimal [12].

Abstract— In this paper, we establish achievable rate regions for
the multiple access channel (MAC) with side information
partially known (estimated or sensed version) at the transmitters.
Actually, we extend the lattice strategies used by Philosof-Zamir
for the MAC with full side information at the transmitters to the
partially known case. We show that the sensed or estimated side
information reduces the rate regions, the same as that occurs for
Costa Gaussian channel.

I.

In this paper, we study the effect of partial SI knowledge in
the Gaussian doubly dirty MAC considered by Philosof-Zamir
[12]. We expect that achievable rate regions are reduced just
the same as in Costa’s DPC considered by in [7]. It is readily
seen that our achievable rates include the achievable rates of
the MAC with full side information as especial cases.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays channels with side information are widely
studied from both information-theoretic and communications
aspects.Side information (SI) can be available at the transmitter
(SIT), and/or at the receiver (SIR). Encoding for a single-user
with causal SIT was first studied by Shannon [1]. The capacity
of a general discrete memoryless channel with non-causal SIT
was characterized by Gel’fand and Pinsker in [4]. Costa [5]
applied the formula obtained by Gel’fand and Pinsker to the
special model of Gaussian channel with additive Gaussian
interference, and showed that the channel capacity in the
presence of interference known at the transmitter is the same as
the case without interference. In Costa’s dirty-paper channel
(DPC), Gaussian random binning is able to eliminate the effect
of interference which is known at the transmitter, and thus
achieves capacity. Cover and Chiang [6] extended the above
results and established a general capacity Theorem for the
channel with two-sided state information. Gueguen-Sayrac [7]
derived the capacity of the DPC with partial side information
knowledge. The partial side information knowledge models the
sensing process approximating the original information. It was
shown that the capacity of the DPC with partial SI is reduced
compared to the DPC with exact or complete SI.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we state some basic terminology for lattices. Section III
includes related works. In Section IV, we state the system
model and our results based on lattice strategies for doubly
dirty MAC with partial SIT. In particular, we devote Section
IV-A to the imbalanced doubly dirty MAC with partial SIT,
and Section IV-B to the nearly balanced doubly dirty MAC
with estimated SIT.

LATTICES AND NESTED LATTICE CODES

proceed and look at the modulo-lattice modulation. An

In the multi-user setting, Das and Narayan [8] provided a
multi-letter characterization of the capacity region of timevarying MACs with various degrees of SIT and SIR. In [9], a
general framework for the capacity region of MACs with
causal and non-causal SI was presented where focused on
the MAC with independent side information at the two
transmitters. Philosof-Zamir [10],[11], extended Jafar’s work
and provided achievable rate regions for the discrete
