complexities and performances. In particular, recently a class
of randomized scheduling algorithms namely the CSMAbased scheduling algorithms ([6],[7],[8]) have received a lot
of attention because of their attractive throughput guarantees
and distributiveness. However, the CSMA based scheduling
algorithms rely on the mixing of the underlying Markov chain
which cannot be guaranteed in a fading environment. Hence
their performance in fading environment is not known.
Speciﬁcally, we develop a FCSMA (Fast-CSMA) based
scheduling algorithm that extends the earlier results to the
SINR-based interference model.1. The FCSMA operation has
advantage over the CSMA based scheduling algorithms under
fading conditions in that it quickly reaches one of the favorable
schedules and sticks to it rather than relying on the convergence of the underlying Markov chain . Hence, the FCSMA
based algorithm can perform well under fading environment
as well.
We ﬁrst note that the straightforward application of FCSMA
to the SINR based interference model has a low performance.
In order to improve the performance of this scheme, we
formulate a dynamic rule to split the incoming trafﬁc into
schedule based queues at the transmitters and combine it
with the FCSMA scheduling. By favorably tuning the control
parameter of the trafﬁc splitting rule, we prove that the
FCSMA based algorithm along with the appropriate trafﬁc
splitting rule can provide a good performance.
Finally, we would like to mention reference [9] a decentralized queue-length dependent probabilistic scheduling
algorithm for the two user multi-access channel. However, the
analysis of the algorithm is done assuming that the channel
realization stays constant through out and hence assumes a
non-fading scenario. In contrast, we analyze our system under
fading environment as well.

Abstract—There has been substantial interest over the last
decade in developing low complexity decentralized scheduling
algorithms in wireless networks. In this context, the queuelength based Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) scheduling
algorithms have attracted signiﬁcant attention because of their
attractive throughput guarantees. However, the CSMA results
rely on the mixing of the underlying Markov chain and their
performance under fading channel states is unknown.
In this work, we formulate a partially decentralized randomized scheduling algorithm for a two transmitter receiver pair set
up and investigate its stability properties. Our work is based on
the Fast-CSMA (FCSMA) algorithm ﬁrst developed in [1] and
we extend its results to a signal to interference noise ratio (SINR)
based interference model in which one or more transmitters can
transmit simultaneously while causing interference to the other.
In order to improve the performance of the system, we split the
trafﬁc arriving at the transmitter into schedule based queues and
combine it with the FCSMA based scheduling algorithm. We
theoretically examine the performance of our algorithm in both
non-fading and fading environment and characterize the set of
arrival rates which can be stabilized by our proposed algorithm.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We consider the problem of decentralized channel access
for the two user interference channel. Classical information
theoretic approach assumes that the transmitters are always
saturated with information bits. However, in this work, we
consider the randomness in arrival of information bits and
hence account for the queuing backlog at the transmitters. We
consider that the transmission rates of each transmitter-receiver
pair are a function of the signal to interference ration (SINR)
at the receiver.
The work in this paper is comparable to the stream of
works related to scheduling algorithms in wireless networks
which operate at the packet level and assume that a ﬁxed
number of packets can be transmitted per time slot . The
task then is to schedule a set of non-conﬂicting links for
transmission (conﬂict graph based interference model) in order
to ensure the long term stability of the associated queues in
the network. The authors in the seminal work of [2] developed a maximum-weight based scheduling strategy which is
proved to be throughput-optimal. However, the max-weight
based algorithms are centralized in nature and suffer from
high computational complexity. Subsequently low-complexity,
decentralized, and possibly suboptimal scheduling algorithms
were developed in series of works [3],[4],[5] with varying

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a set up in which two transmitters (Tx) are
trying to communicate to their respective receivers (Rx) over a
common frequency band. We assume that the system operates
in a time slotted fashion. We denote Ai [t] as the amount of
information bits that ﬂow into the Txi during each time slot
t. The arrival process is assumed to be independent across the
1 Reference [1] develops the FCSMA algorithm for a conﬂict graph based
interference model in which only one transmitter can transmit at a time.

users and identically distributed over time slots with a rate of
λi , i = 1, 2, and Ai [t] ≤ K, ∀t, for some 0 < K < ∞.
Accordingly, there is queue associated with Txi whose queuelength at time slot t is denoted by the notation Qi [t]. Let Si [t]
denote the number of information bits served from the queue
of Txi during the time slot t. The equation for the queue-length
evolution is given by
Qi [t + 1] = Qi [t] + Ai [t] − Si [t] + Ui [t],

The FCSMA based scheduling algorithm operates in the
following way. At the beginning of time slot t, each Tx
independently generates two timers whose values are an exponentially distributed random variable with mean Qi [t]Ri and
Qi [t]ri respectively. These timers correspond to the respective
scheduling decisions in which the Txi can achieve a non zero
rate. We assume that each Tx maintains a one bit index for
the timers associated with it. Let us assume that the index of
0 corresponds to the timer Qi [t]Ri and an index of 1 indicates
that timer Qi [t]ri .
The system has four timers. Without the loss of generality,
assume that one of the timers associated with Tx1 expires ﬁrst
among the four timers. The algorithm operates in the following
manner. Tx1 immediately suspends its second timer (which
has not yet expired) and starts to transmit bits from its queue
at the appropriate rate (rate R1 if timer 0 expires or a rate
r1 if timer 1 expires). Tx1 communicates the index of timer
which has expired to Tx2 . Upon receiving the index bit, Tx2
also suspends both its timers. We assume the following preagreed protocol between the two Txs. Upon reception of the
index 0, the Tx2 keeps silent during corresponding time slot
t. Upon reception of the index 1, the Tx2 transmits from its
queue at the rate r2 . We ignore the overhead associated with
communicating the bit between the two Txs. The state diagram
for the FCSMA based scheduling algorithm is shown in Figure
2 and the probabilities of reaching each of the three possible
schedules during a time slot t are given by

where Ui [t] denotes the unused service, 0 < Ui [t] ≤ 1 if user
i is selected for service and Qi [t] ≤ 1, Ui [t] = 0 otherwise. We
T −1

say that a queue is stable if lim supT →∞ T t=0 E [Qi [t]] <
∞.
We consider the SINR based interference model in which
one or more transmitters can transmit simultaneously. In this
case, the maximum achievable transmission rate for any Tx-Rx
depends on the SINR at the Rx. In general, the transmission
rate for a Tx-Rx pair during any time slot can be chosen from
a continuous set. However, in order to simplify the analysis,
we allow two levels of rates for every Tx-Rx pair. First, a rate
of Ri when only one of the two transmitters is transmitting
(while the other transmitter is turned off) and a rate ri
when both the transmitters are transmitting simultaneously (in
which case, they cause interference to each other). These rates
correspond to the three possible scheduling decisions in the
set Ω = {ω1 , ω2 , ω3 } where the rates obtained in the three
scheduling decisions are given by {R1 , 0}, {0, R2}, {r1 , r2 }
respectively. A reasonable assumption is that the maximum
achievable rate is an increasing function of the SINR. Hence,
we assume that the rates r1 ≤ R1 and r2 ≤ R2 . The stability
region for this system can be given as the convex hull of the
possible transmission rates.

Remarks on the FCSMA algorithm: The FCSMA based
scheduling algorithm described above is a partially decentralized algorithm in which the Txs exchange one bit information
(index of the timer that expires ﬁrst). This calls for a substantially less overhead of information exchange between the
Txs as compared to exchanging the full CSI. From the plot
of the stability region in Figure 1, notice that the maximum
achievable rate in the symmetric case λ1 = λ2 = λ is
λ < α (any arrival rate arbitrarily close to λ can be stabilized).
However, the bound speciﬁed in (4) is lesser than α.
In what follows, we overcome this problem by combining
the FCSMA scheduling scheme with a dynamic trafﬁc splitting
algorithm. The main idea behind splitting the incoming trafﬁc
is to modify the scheduling probabilities of the FCMSA
algorithm in a such a way that the service rates adapt to the
incoming trafﬁc arrival rate appropriately.

Having deﬁned a dynamic trafﬁc splitting policy described
above, the next task is to examine theoretically the set of
arrival rates which can be stabilized by our algorithm. To this
end, we deﬁne a Lyapunov function and examine its properties
for different values of the queue-lengths. In order to make
things more amenable for theoretical analysis, we restrict our
proofs to a perfectly symmetric system model.
Theorem 2. Consider a 2-user perfectly symmetric network
described in Proposition 1. When the mean rate of the arrival
process into the two transmitters are the same (i.e., λ1 = λ2 =
λ), the maximum arrival rate which can be supported by the
trafﬁc splitting policy described in equation (5) followed by
the FCSMA scheduling algorithm is given by

In this section, we introduce the concept of schedule based
queues to split the input trafﬁc arriving into the Txs. Each
Tx maintains two different queues one for each scheduling
decision. For the Txi , the queue Qii corresponds to the ﬁrst
scheduling decision in which the Txi can transmit at the
higher rate Ri . When selected for service, this queue gets a
service rate of Ri . Let us deﬁne ¯ = mod (i, 2) + 1. The
i
second queue Qi¯ corresponds to the scheduling decision in
i
which both the Txs have joint access to the channel and when
selected for service, gets a rate of ri . The trafﬁc splitting
policy can be described as follows. During the time slot t,
each transmitter compares the current queue-lengths Qii [t] and
δi Qi¯[t] where δi ≥ 0 is a scaling factor. If Qii [t] < δi Qi¯[t],
i
i
the information bits arriving in the respective slot enter the
queue Qii and vice versa. Accordingly,

maximum supportable rate is to examine the drift of the
Lyapunov function and determine the maximum value of the
arrival rate λ for which the Lyapunov drift is negative outside
a bounded region around the origin. In doing so, we bound
the Lyapunov function by a series of upper bounds and take
the most restrictive condition on the arrival rate λ. Recall that
the queue-length evolution is given by

We justify our claim in the following way. Let us deﬁne the
upper bound on λ in (15) as λmax . Notice the expression
for f1 (Q) in equation (11) is an increasing function of λ
for a ﬁxed value of the queue-length. Therefore, f1 (Q) λ ≤
f1 (Q) λ=λmax ≤ 0 for λ ≤ λmax and hence the claim of (15).
Notice that the bound of (15) was obtained considering
a ﬁxed value of Q11 and Q22 . However, the argument is
true for any positive value of Q11 and Q22 . Hence repeating
the arguments for any Q11 and Q22 , we conclude that the
Lyapunov drift is negative for all positive values of queuelengths and λ ≤ λmax . Similarly we have three more cases to
analyze.
Case2: Q11 ≥ δQ12 ; Q22 ≥ δQ21 .
Case3: Q11 ≥ δQ12 ; Q22 ≤ δQ21 .
Case4: Q11 ≤ δQ12 ; Q22 ≥ δQ21 .
By writing the expression for the Lyapunov drift appropriately
in each case and analyzing the drift similar to that of case 1,
it can be shown that in each of the four cases, the Lyapunov
drift is negative for λ ≤ λmax .
By Foster-Lyapunov theorem [11], the queue-lengths are
stable for λ ≤ λmax .
Remarks on the dynamic trafﬁc splitting algorithm: Note
that the result of Theorem 2 can be generalized to the case
when the data rates are {R, 0}, {r, r}, {0, R}. In this case any

the function f1 (Q) with respect to the variables Q12 and Q21 ,

is a decreasing function of both Q12 and Q21 . Therefore for a

rate λ < r+δR + 2(r+δR) can be stabilized. The FCSMA based
algorithm along with the dynamic trafﬁc splitting algorithm
provides us with a tunable parameter δ which can be varied in
order to achieve better performance. Speciﬁcally when λ1 =
λ2 = λ, by setting δ = 0, from the result of Theorem 2 that
any rate λ < α can be stabilized by the system (which is also
the maximum achievable rate in the symmetric arrival case
from the plot of the stability region). The parameter δ can
be calculated based on the point inside the stability region in
which we are operating.

lengths. Hence, V (Q) λ≤λmax < V (Q) λ=λmax for λ < λmax .
Also, this argument holds for any value of the queue-lengths.

Therefore, V (Q) ≤ 0 for λ < λmax and for all values of
queue-length and hence any rate λ < λmax is stabilizable.

Now consider a symmetric block fading model where
the channel realization is ﬁxed during the time slot but
changes after every time slot t. The set of channels in the
network can assume a state s = {1, . . . , S} according to
stationary probability ps . We denote the cardinality of the

set by |S| and
s=1 ps = 1. In each time slot t, the
achievable rate for the three possible scheduling decisions are

In this work, we have formulated a partially decentralized
randomized scheduling algorithm for a two user set up under a SINR based interference model. In our algorithm, the
transmitters have to exchange only one bit information between themselves. Our algorithm has advantage over existing
scheduling algorithms since it is decentralized in nature and
can perform well under fading conditions. Our theoretical
analysis was limited to the case of symmetric network settings
and symmetric arrival rates. The application of the FCSMA
algorithm to a general network setting is left for future
investigation.

where Bs (Q) = Rs Q11 + rs (Q12 + Q21 ) + Rs Q22 . Let us
denote the maximum supportable arrival rate in the fading
case by the notation λmax . We will ﬁrst analyze the Laypunov
drift term at λ = λmax . Notice that λmax can be written as
a convex combination of λs (where λs are some rate points
inside the stability region on the line λ1 = λ2 ) and hence

λmax = s=1 ps λs . Therefore, we can rewrite the Lyapunov
drift as
