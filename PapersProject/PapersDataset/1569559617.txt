Polyanskiy et al. provided bounds for the maximum rate that
can be accomplished with feedback for a ﬁnite block length
[11] and also demonstrated the energy-efﬁciency gains made
possible by feedback [14]. In the variable-length feedback
with termination (VLFT) scheme, [11] uses an elegant, single,
“stop feedback” symbol (that can occur after any transmitted
symbol) that facilitates the application of Martingale theory
to capture the essence of how feedback can allow a variablelength code to approach capacity. A compelling example from
[11] shows that for a binary symmetric channel with capacity
1/2, the average block length required to achieve 90% of the
capacity is smaller than 200 symbols.
For practical systems such as hybrid ARQ, the “stop feedback” symbol may only be feasible at certain symbol times
because these systems group symbols together for transmission
in packets, so that the entire packet is either transmitted or
not. In [12], [13], Chen et al. used a code-independent ratecompatible sphere-packing (RCSP) analysis to quantify the
latency beneﬁts of feedback in the context of such grouped
transmissions. Chen et al. focused on the AWGN channel and
also showed that capacity can be approached with surprisingly
small block lengths, similar to the results of [11].
Using the RCSP approach of Chen et al. as its foundation,
this paper introduces an optimization technique and uses it to
explore how closely one may approach capacity with only a
handful of incremental transmissions. For a ﬁxed number of
information bits k and a ﬁxed number of maximum transmissions m before giving up to try again from scratch, a numerical
optimization determines the block lengths of each incremental
transmission to maximize the expected throughput. We consider only m≤6 and show that this is sufﬁcient to achieve
more than 90% of capacity while requiring surprisingly small
block lengths similar to those achieved by Polyanskiy et al.
and Chen et al.
While RCSP is an idealized scheme, it provides meaningful
guidance for the selection of block lengths and the sequence of
target decoding error rates, which we call the decoding error
trajectory. A 1024-state rate-compatible punctured tail-biting
convolutional code using the block lengths determined by our
RCSP optimization technique achieves the RCSP decoding
error trajectory and essentially matches the throughput and
latency performance of RCSP for m=5 transmissions. Our
results, like those of Polyanskiy et al. and Chen et al., assume

Abstract—Recent work by Polyanskiy et al. and Chen et al.
has excited new interest in using feedback to approach capacity
with low latency. Polyanskiy showed that feedback identifying
the ﬁrst symbol at which decoding is successful allows capacity
to be approached with surprisingly low latency. This paper uses
Chen’s rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP) analysis to study
what happens when symbols must be transmitted in packets, as
with a traditional hybrid ARQ system, and limited to relatively
few (six or fewer) incremental transmissions.
Numerical optimizations ﬁnd the series of progressively growing cumulative block lengths that enable RCSP to approach
capacity with the minimum possible latency. RCSP analysis shows
that ﬁve incremental transmissions are sufﬁcient to achieve 92%
of capacity with an average block length of fewer than 101
symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB.
The RCSP analysis provides a decoding error trajectory that
speciﬁes the decoding error rate for each cumulative block
length. Though RCSP is an idealization, an example tail-biting
convolutional code matches the RCSP decoding error trajectory
and achieves 91% of capacity with an average block length of
102 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB. We also
show how RCSP analysis can be used in cases where packets have
deadlines associated with them (leading to an outage probability).

I. I NTRODUCTION
Though Shannon showed in 1956 [1] that noiseless feedback does not increase the capacity of memoryless channels,
feedback’s other beneﬁts have made it a staple in modern communication systems. Feedback can simplify the encoding and
decoding operations and has been incorporated into incremental redundancy (IR) schemes proposed as early as 1974 [2].
Hagenauer’s work on rate-compatible punctured convolutional
(RCPC) codes allows the same encoder to be used in various
channel conditions and uses feedback to determine when to
send additional coded bits [3]. The combination of IR and
hybrid ARQ (HARQ) continues to receive attention in the
literature [4]–[6] and industry standards such as 3GPP.
Although it cannot increase capacity in point-to-point channels, the information-theoretic beneﬁt of feedback for reducing latency through a signiﬁcant improvement in the error
exponent has been well understood for some time. (See, for
example, [7]–[10].) Recent work [11]–[13] casts the latency
beneﬁt of feedback in terms of block length rather than error
exponent, generating new interest in the practical value of
feedback for approaching capacity with a short average block
length.

MIRF works as follows: k information symbols are coded with
an initial block length N1 = I1 . If the receiver cannot successfully decode, the transmitter will receive a NACK and send
I2 extra symbols. The decoder attempts to decode again using
all received symbols for the current codeword, i.e., with block
length N2 = I1 + I2 . The process continues for i = 3, . . . , m.
The decoded block length Nj is I1 + I2 + · · · + Ij and the
code rate is Rj = k/Nj . If decoding is not successful after m
transmissions, the decoder discards the m transmissions and
the process begins again with the transmitter resending the I1
initial symbols. This scheme with m=1 is standard ARQ.
The squared decoding radius of the jth cumulative transmission is

that the receiver is able to recognize when it has successfully
decoded. The additional overhead of, for example, a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) has not been included in the analysis.
Longer block lengths would be required to overcome this
overhead penalty.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews
the RCSP analysis. Section III describes the RCSP numerical optimization used to determine transmission lengths and
shows the throughput vs. latency performance achieved by
using these transmission lengths for up to six rate-compatible
transmissions. This performance is compared with a version
of VLFT scheme proposed by Polyanskiy et al. Section IV
introduces the decoding error trajectory and shows how RCSP
performance can be matched by a real convolutional code using the transmission lengths identiﬁed in the previous section.
Section V shows how the RCSP analysis can be applied to
scenarios that involve strict latency and outage probability
constraints. Section VI concludes the paper.

where the z are standard normal distributed random variables

However, this marginal probability is not what is needed.
The probability of a decoding error in the jth transmission
depends on previous error events. Indeed, conditioning on
previous decoding errors ζ1 , . . . , ζj−1 makes the error event
ζj more likely than the marginal distribution would suggest.

A bounded-distance decoder declares any message within a

the N Gaussian noise samples obeys a chi-square distribution
with N degrees of freedom, the probability P (ζ) of decoding
error associated with decoding radius r is

§

 

In [12], Chen et al. demonstrated one speciﬁc RCSP scheme
with ten transmissions that could approach capacity with low
latency. Speciﬁcally, the transmission lengths were ﬁxed to
I1 =64 and I2 , . . . , I10 =10, while k was varied to maximize
throughput. This paper builds on the intuition of the ARQ
case presented above. Both k and the number of transmissions
m are ﬁxed, and a search identiﬁes the set of transmission
lengths Ii that maximizes throughput. We seek to identify
approximately how much throughput can be achieved using
feedback with a small number of incremental transmissions,
speciﬁcally m≤6. Furthermore, we seek insight into what the
transmission lengths should be and what decoding error rates
allow the sequence of transmissions to be most efﬁcient.
For m>1, identifying the transmission lengths Ii which
minimize the latency λ in (7) is not straightforward due to
the joint decoding error probabilities in (6). However, the
restriction to a small m allows exact computation of (6) in
Mathematica, avoiding the approximations of [12]. To reﬂect
practical constraints, we restrict the lengths Ii to be integers.
The computational complexity of (6), which increases with
the transmission index j, forces us to limit attention to a
well-chosen subset of possible transmission lengths. Thus, our
present results may be considered as lower bounds to what is
possible with a fully exhaustive optimization. Fig. 1(a) shows
the throughput vs. latency performance achieved by RCSP
for m ∈ {1, . . . 6} on an AWGN channel with SNR 2.0 dB.
As m is increased, each additional retransmission brings the
expected throughput Rt closer to the channel capacity, though
with diminishing returns. The points on each curve in Fig.
1(a) represent values of k ranging from 16 to 256 information
bits. Fig. 1(a) shows, for example, that by allowing up to four
retransmissions (m=5) with k=64, RCSP can achieve 91% of
capacity with an average block length of 102 symbols. Similar
results are obtained for other SNRs.

Fig. 1. Throughput vs. latency for RCSP with m rate-compatible transmissions m ∈ {1, . . . , 6} with transmission lengths Ii identiﬁed by RCSP
optimization. Also shown are convolutional code simulations, VLFT and a
constrained version of VLFT that uses the RCSP m=5 block lengths.

VLFT achievability results for the AWGN channel based on
[11] are shown in Fig. 1(b) for comparison. Both the original
VLFT scheme, in which the transmission may be ended after
any symbol, and a constrained version of VLFT using the
same block lengths and feedback structure as m=5 RCSP
are presented. The original VLFT closely approaches capacity
with a latency on the order of 200 symbols. RCSP is unable to
match VLFT because the overall RCSP transmission can only
be terminated after one of the m incremental transmissions
completes. If VLFT is constrained in the same way, its performance is initially worse than RCSP because random coding
does not achieve ideal sphere packing with short block lengths.
At an average latency of 200, constrained VLFT performance
becomes similar to the comparable RCSP scheme.
The VLFT achievability curve evaluates [11, Theorem 10]
using the upper bound of (162) with i.i.d. Gaussian inputs with
average power equal to the power constraint η. Such codebooks will sometimes violate the 2 dB power constraint. To
address this, the average power should be slightly reduced and
codebooks violating the power constraint should be purged,
which will lead to a small performance degradation. Alternatively, codebooks or even codewords can be constrained to
meet the power constraint with equality. Further analysis of
VLFT codes more carefully considering the power constraint
for the AWGN channel will be the subject of future work.

IV. C OMPARISON OF RCSP

AND

The RCSP optimization also computes the joint decoding
error probabilities of (6), which we call the “decoding error
trajectory”. If we can ﬁnd a rate-compatible family that
achieves this decoding error trajectory, then we can match
the RCSP performance. Fig. 3 shows the k=64 decoding
error trajectories for the RCSP cases studied in Figs. 1 and
2 (shown as m discrete points in Fig. 3 for each value of
m ∈ {1, . . . , 6}) and for constrained VLFT for m = 5 and 64state and 1024-state convolutional code simulations for m=5.
The dashed line represents the marginal probability of error
for a sphere-packing codebook as in (3) which was recognized
in [19] as a tight upper bound for the joint probabilities of
error given by (6). This tight upper bound can serve as a
performance goal for practical rate-compatible code design
across a wide range of block lengths.
While the 64-state code is not powerful enough to match
RCSP performance, the 1024-state code closely follows the
RCSP trajectory for m = 5. Thus there exist practical codes,
at least in some cases, that achieve the idealized performance
of RCSP. Indeed, Fig. 1(b) plots the (λ, Rt ) points of the
two convolutional codes, demonstrating that the 1024-state
code achieves 91% of capacity with an average latency of
102 symbols, almost exactly coinciding with the RCSP point
for m=5 and k=64. The convolutional code’s ability to match
a mythical sphere-packing code is due to maximum likelihood
(ML) decoding, which has decoding regions that completely
ﬁll the multidimensional space (even in high dimensions).

C ONVOLUTIONAL C ODES

RCSP makes the rather optimistic assumption that a family
of rate-compatible codes can be found that performs, at each
rate, equally well as codes that pack decoding spheres so well
that they use all of the available volume. A variety of wellknown upper bounds on the packing density φ indicate that
the maximum packing density decreases as the dimension n
increases (e.g., φ ≤ (n/e) 2−n/2 ) [17], making such codes
difﬁcult to ﬁnd. However, we show in this section that a ratecompatible tail-biting convolutional code can indeed match the
performance of RCSP, at least for m=5.
A. Two Convolutional Codes
We consider two rate 1/3 convolutional codes
from [18]: a 64-state code with generator polynomial
(g1 ,g2 ,g3 )=(133, 171, 165) and a 1024-state code with
(g1 ,g2 ,g3 )=(3645, 2133, 3347), where the generator notation
is octal. High rate codewords are created by pseudorandom
rate-compatible puncturing of the rate 1/3 mother codes.
We restrict our attention to tail-biting implementations of
these convolutional codes because the throughput efﬁciency
advantage is important for the relatively small block lengths
we consider. Simulations compare the performance of these
two codes in the MIRF setting for the AWGN channel with
SNR 2 dB, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The simulations presented
here focus on the k=64 case.
The transmission lengths Ii used in the simulations are
those identiﬁed by the RCSP optimization. Table I shows the
results of the m=5 optimization (i.e., the set of lengths Ii
found to achieve the highest throughput). Thus our simulations
used I1 =85, I2 =12, I3 =8, I4 =12, I5 =16. The induced code
rates of the cumulative blocks are 64/85=0.753, 64/97=0.660,
64/105=0.610, 64/117=0.547 and 64/133=0.481. Fig. 2 shows
these rates as well as the rates for other values of k according
to the RCSP optimization for m = 5. Note that for every
value of k the initial code rate is above the channel capacity
of 0.6851. This is the beneﬁt of feedback: it allows the decoder

C. Caveat
These simulation results assume that the receiver is able
to recognize when it has successfully decoded. This same
assumption is made by the RCSP analysis, the VLFT scheme
of Polyanskiy et al., and the MIRF scheme of Chen et al.
While this assumption does not undermine the essence of
this demonstration of the power of feedback, its practical and
theoretical implications must be reviewed carefully, especially
when very short block lengths are considered. An important
practical implication is that the additional overhead of a CRC
required to avoid undetected errors will drive real systems

4

in demonstrating that feedback permits 90% of capacity to be
achieved with about 100 transmitted symbols assuming that
the decoder knows when it has decoded correctly. However,
the implications of this assumption for short block lengths
warrant further investigation.
VLFT performance shows that if the transmission could be
stopped at any symbol (rather than only at the end of each
incremental transmission) capacity is closely approached with
an average latency of 200 symbols, but a more careful analysis
of VLFT in light of the AWGN power constraint is warranted.

to somewhat longer block lengths than those presented here.
This will affect the choice of error control code. An important
implication is that this analysis cannot be trusted if the block
lengths become too small. This assumption allows block errors
to become block erasures at no cost. Consider the binary
symmetric channel (BSC): If the block length is allowed to
shrink to a single bit, then this assumption turns the zero
capacity BSC with transition probability 1/2 into a binary
erasure channel with probability 1/2, which has a capacity
of 1/2 instead of zero. Both the practical and theoretical
problems of this assumption diminish as block length grows.
However, a quantitative understanding of the cost of knowing
when decoding is successful and how that cost changes with
block length is an important area for future work.

MIRF has an outage probability of zero because it never
stops trying until a message is decoded correctly. With slight
modiﬁcations, the MIRF scheme and the RCSP transmission
length optimization can incorporate strict constraints on latency (so that the transmitter gives up after m transmissions)
and outage probability (which would then be nonzero).
To handle these two new constraints, we restrict
P (ζ1 , . . . , ζm ) to be less than a speciﬁed poutage . Without
modifying the computations ofP (ζ1 , . . . , ζj ) in (6), the optimization is adapted to pick the set of lengths that yields the
maximum throughput s.t. P (ζ1 , . . . , ζm ) ≤ poutage . When there
is a decoding error after the mth transmission, the transmitter
declares an outage event and proceeds to encode the next k
information bits. This scheme is suitable for delay-sensitive
communications, in which data packets are not useful to the
receiver after a deadline has passed. The expected number of
channel uses λ is now given by

VI. C ONCLUSION
The purpose of this paper is to bring the information theory
of feedback and the communication practice of feedback
closer together. Beginning with the idealized notion of ratecompatible codes with decoding spheres that completely ﬁll
the available volume, the paper eventually demonstrates a
convolutional code with performance strikingly similar to the
ideal rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP) codes.
An optimization based on RCSP identiﬁes the highest
throughput possible for a ﬁxed k and m. This optimization
provides the lengths of the initial and subsequent transmissions and the sequence of decoding error probabilities or
“decoding error trajectory” that characterize the throughputmaximizing performance. The RCSP decoding error trajectories computed in this paper are tightly bounded by the marginal
error probability of sphere packing. Designing a code with
a similar error trajectory will thus yield comparable latency
performance. RCSP predictions and simulation results agree
