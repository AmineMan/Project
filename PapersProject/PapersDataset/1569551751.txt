Abstract—We discuss two techniques for transmitting classical
information over quantum broadcast channels. The ﬁrst technique is a quantum generalization of the superposition coding
scheme for the classical broadcast channel. We use a quantum
simultaneous nonunique decoder and obtain a simpler proof of
the rate region recently published by Yard et al. in independent
work. Our second result is a quantum Marton coding scheme,
which gives the best known achievable rate region for quantum
broadcast channels. Both results exploit recent advances in
quantum simultaneous decoding developed in the context of
quantum interference channels.

simpler and more in the spirit of its classical analogue [1].
In Section IV we prove that the quantum Marton rate region
with no common message is achievable (Theorem 2). In the
Marton coding scheme, the sub-channels to each receiver are
essentially point-to-point, but it turns out that a technique that
we call the “projector trick” seems to be necessary in our
proof. We discuss open problems and give an outlook for the
future in Section V.

I. I NTRODUCTION
How can a broadcast station communicate separate messages to two receivers using a single antenna? Two well
known strategies [1] for transmitting information over broadcast channels are superposition coding [2], [3] and Marton
over-binning using correlated auxiliary random variables [4].
In this paper, we prove that these strategies can be adapted
to the quantum setting by constructing random codebooks
and matching decoding measurements that have asymptotically
vanishing error in the limit of many uses of the channel.
Sending classical data over a quantum channel is one
of the fundamental problems of quantum information theory [5]. Single-letter formulas are known for classical-quantum
point-to-point channels [6], [7] and multiple access channels
[8]. Classical-quantum channels are a useful abstraction for
studying general quantum channels and correspond to the
transmitters being restricted to classical encodings. Codes for
classical-quantum channels (c-q channels), when augmented
with an extra optimization over the possible input states, directly generalize to codes for quantum channels. Furthermore,
it is known that classical encoding (coherent-state encoding
using classical Gaussian codebooks) is sufﬁcient to achieve
the capacity of the lossy bosonic channel, which is a realistic
model for optical communication links [9].
Previous work on quantum broadcast channels includes
[10], [11], [12]. Ref. [10] considers both classical and quantum
communication over quantum broadcast channels and proves
a superposition coding inner bound similar to our Theorem 1.
Ref. [11] discusses classical communication over a bosonic
broadcast channel, and Ref. [12] considers a Marton rate
region for quantum communication.
In this paper, we derive two achievable rate regions for
classical-quantum broadcast channels by exploiting error analysis techniques developed in the context of quantum interference channels [13], [14]. In Section III, we prove achievability
of the superposition coding inner bound (Theorem 1), by using
a quantum simultaneous nonunique decoder at one of the
receivers. Yard et al. independently proved the quantum superposition coding inner bound [10], but our proof is arguably

1) Notation: We denote classical random variables as
X, U, W , whose realizations are elements of the respective
ﬁnite alphabets X , U, W. Let pX , pU , pW denote their corresponding probability distributions. We denote quantum systems as A, B, and C and their corresponding Hilbert spaces as
HA , HB , and HC . We represent quantum states of a system A
with a density operator ρA , which is a positive semi-deﬁnite
operator with unit trace. Let H(A)ρ ≡ −Tr ρA log ρA
denote the von Neumann entropy of the state ρA . A classicalquantum channel, N X→B , is represented by the set of |X |
possible output states {ρB ≡ N X→B(x)}, meaning that a
x
classical input of x leads to a quantum output ρB . In a
x
communication scenario, the decoding operations performed
by the receivers correspond to quantum measurements on the
outputs of the channel. A quantum measurement is a positive
operator-valued measure (POVM) {Λm }m∈{1,...,|M|} on the
system B n , the output of which we denote M . To be a valid
POVM, the set of |M| operators Λm must all be positive semideﬁnite and sum to the identity: Λm ≥ 0,
m Λm = I.
2) Deﬁnitions: We deﬁne a classical-quantum-quantum
broadcast channel as the following map:

II. P RELIMINARIES

x → ρB1 B2 ,
x

(1)

where x is a classical letter in an alphabet X and ρB1 B2 is
x
a density operator on the tensor product Hilbert space for
systems B1 and B2 . The model is such that when the sender
inputs a classical letter x, Receiver 1 obtains system B1 , and
Receiver 2 obtains system B2 . Since Receiver 1 does not have
B
access to the B2 part of the state ρx 1 B2 , we model his state
B
as ρB1 = TrB2 ρx 1 B2 , where TrB2 denotes the partial trace
x
over Receiver 2’s system.
3) Information processing task: The task of communication
over a broadcast channel is to use n independent instances of
the channel in order to communicate with Receiver 1 at a
rate R1 and to Receiver 2 at a rate R2 . More speciﬁcally, the
sender chooses a pair of messages (m1 , m2 ) from message sets
Mi ≡ {1, 2, . . . , |Mi |}, where |Mi | = 2nRi , and encodes
these messages into an n-symbol codeword xn (m1 , m2 ) ∈ X n
suitable as input for the n channel uses.

Theorem 1 (Superposition coding inner bound). A rate pair
(R1 , R2 ) is achievable for the quantum broadcast channel in
(1) if it satisﬁes the following inequalities:

Proof: The new idea in the proof is to exploit superposition encoding and a quantum simultaneous nonunique decoder
for the decoding of the ﬁrst receiver [2], [3] instead of the
quantum successive decoding used in [10]. We use a standard
HSW decoder for the second receiver [6], [7].

POVM Construction. We now describe the POVMs that
the receivers employ in order to decode the transmitted messages. First consider the state we obtain from (8) by tracing
over the B2 system:

A rate pair (R1 , R2 ) is achievable if there exists an
(n, R1 − δ, R2 − δ, ) quantum broadcast channel code for all
, δ > 0 and sufﬁciently large n.
When devising coding strategies for c-q channels, the main
obstacle to overcome is the construction of a decoding POVM
that correctly decodes the messages. Given a set of positive
operators {Πm } which are suitable for detecting each message,
we can construct a POVM by normalizing them using the
square-root measurement [6], [7]:
Λm ≡

Deﬁnition 1. An (n, R1 , R2 , ) broadcast channel code consists of a codebook {xn (m1 , m2 )}m1 ∈M1 ,m2 ∈M2 and two

message m1 intended for him, Receiver 1 performs a POVM

we denote M1 . Receiver 2 similarly performs a POVM
n
{Γm2 }m2 ∈{1,...,|M2 |} on the system B2 , and the random
variable associated with the outcome is denoted M2 .
An error occurs whenever either of the receivers decodes the
message incorrectly. The probability of error for a particular
message pair (m1 , m2 ) is

Thus, the search for a decoding POVM is reduced to the problem of ﬁnding positive operators Πm apt at detecting and distinguishing the output states produced by each of the possible
input messages (Tr[Πm ρm ] ≥ 1 − and Tr[Πm ρm =m ] ≤ ).

One possible strategy for the broadcast channel is to send a
message at a rate that is low enough so that both receivers are
able to decode. Furthermore, if we assume that Receiver 1 has
a better reception signal, then the sender can encode a further
message superimposed on top of the common message that
Receiver 1 will be able to decode given the common message.
The sender encodes the common message at rate R2 using a
codebook generated from a probability distribution pW (w),
and the additional message for Receiver 1 at rate R1 using a
conditional codebook with distribution pX|W (x|w).

¯
1
typical projectors in this case [5, Section 14.2.3]. Knowing 1
and the binning scheme, Receiver 1 can deduce the message
m1 from the bin index. Receiver 2 uses a similar decoding
strategy to obtain 2 and infer m2 .
Error analysis. An error occurs if one (or more) of the
following error events occurs.
E0 : An encoding error occurs whenever there is no
jointly typical sequence in Bm1 × Cm2 for some
message pair (m1 , m2 ).
E1 : A decoding error occurs at Receiver 1 if L1 = 1 .
E2 : A decoding error occurs at Receiver 2 if L2 = 2 .
The probability of an encoding error E0 is bounded like
in the classical Marton scheme [4], [1], [17]. To see this, we
use Cover’s counting argument [17]. The probability that two
random sequences un , un chosen according to the marginals
1
2
are jointly typical is 2−nI(U1 ;U2 ) and since there are on average
2n[I(U1 ;B1 )−R1 ] and 2n[I(U2 ;B2 )−R2 ] sequences in each bin,
the expected number of jointly-typical sequences that can be
constructed from each combination of bins is

The equality I(W X; B1 ) = I(X; B1 ) follows from the way
the codebook is constructed (i.e., the Markov chain W − X −
B), as discussed also in [14]. This completes the error analysis
for the ﬁrst receiver.
The proof for the second receiver is analogous to the pointto-point HSW theorem. The appendix of Ref. [15] gives the
details for this and ties the coding theorem together so that
the sender and two receivers can agree on a strategy that has
asymptotically vanishing error probability in the large n limit.

Thus, if we choose R1 + R2 + δ ≤ I(U1 ; B1 ) + I(U2 ; B2 ) −
I(U1 ; U2 ), then the expected number of strongly jointly-typical
sequences in Bm1 × Cm2 is much larger than one.
To bound the probability of error event E1 , we use the
Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality (Lemma 3 in the appendix of Ref. [15]):

tool that generalizes El Gamal and Kim’s classical packing
lemma [1] to the quantum domain. The packing lemma is
sufﬁcient to prove all of the known coding theorems in
network information theory. At the moment, it is not clear
to us whether such a tool exists for the quantum case, but
evidence in favor of its existence is that 1) one can prove the
HSW coding theorem by using conditionally typical projectors
only [5, Exercise 19.3.5], 2) we have solved the quantum
simultaneous decoding conjecture for the case of two senders
[13], [14], and 3) we have generalized two important coding
theorems in the current paper (with proofs somewhat similar to
the classical proofs). Ideally, such a tool would allow quantum
information theorists to prove quantum network coding theorems by appealing to it, rather than having to analyze each
coding scheme in detail on a case by case basis.

where the inequalities follow from (12) and Lemma 1. This
use of Lemma 1 demonstrates why the Marton coding scheme
selects the sequences un ( 1 ) and un ( 2 ) such that they are

To bound the second term, we begin by applying a variant

Therefore, if we choose 2nR1 = L1 ≤ 2n[I(U1 ;B1 )−3δ] , the
probability of error will go to zero in the asymptotic limit of
many channel uses. The analysis of the event E2 is similar.
V. C ONCLUSION
We have proved quantum generalizations of the superposition coding inner bound [2], [3] and the Marton rate region
with no common message [4]. The key ingredient in both
proofs was the use of the projector trick. A natural followup
question would be to combine the two strategies to obtain the
Marton coding scheme with a common message.
A much broader goal would be to extend all of network
information theory to the study of quantum channels. To
accomplish this goal, it would be helpful to have a powerful
