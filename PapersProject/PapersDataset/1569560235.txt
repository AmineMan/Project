inputs and outputs are binary vectors, representing the binary
expansion of the real valued signals in the Gaussian case.
The actions of the channel are modeled by shifting these
vectors up or down, depending on the most-signiﬁcant bit of
the channel gains, and by bitwise addition over the binary
ﬁeld of interfering vectors. The signal layers are represented
by the different bits in the binary expansion of the signals. In
the second step, the signaling schemes and the outer bounds
developed for this simpler deterministic model are used to
guide the design of efﬁcient signaling schemes for the original
Gaussian problem.
For communication scenarios in which interference alignment is required, this strategy has only been successfully
used to obtain constant-gap capacity approximations for the
fairly restrictive many-to-one interference channel [6]. Even
for the X-channel, one of the simplest Gaussian network in
which interference alignment is required, only weaker (generalized) degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations were
derived using the deterministic approach [7]. The resulting
communication scheme for the Gaussian X-channel is quite
complicated and cannot be used to derive a constant-gap
capacity approximation.
For the real interference alignment approach, each transmitter modulates its signal using an integer lattice transmit
constellation. The transmit constellations are then scaled by a
constant to ensure that at each receiver all interfering lattice
constellations coincide, while desired lattice constellations are
disjoint. Each receiver recovers the desired signals using a
minimum-distance decoder. A number-theoretic result concerning the approximability of real numbers by rationals,
called Groshev’s theorem, is used to analyze the minimum
constellation distance at the receivers. For almost all channel
gains, this scheme is shown to achieve the full degrees-offreedom of the Gaussian X-channel and the Gaussian interference channel [3]. While this scheme is asymptotically
optimal for almost all channel gains, there are inﬁnitely
many channel gains for which the scheme fails, for example
when the channel gains are rational. This leads to concerns
about the robustness of this approach with respect to channel
measurement errors. Moreover, this approach can again not be
used to derive stronger constant-gap capacity approximations.
Some of these concerns follow from the fact that real
interference alignment is somehow isolated from other known

Abstract—Interference alignment is a key technique for communication scenarios with multiple interfering links. In several
such scenarios, interference alignment was used to characterize
the degrees-of-freedom of the channel. However, these degreesof-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak to make
accurate predictions about the behavior of channel capacity
at ﬁnite signal-to-noise ratios. The aim of this paper is to
signiﬁcantly strengthen these results by showing that interference
alignment can be used to characterize capacity to within a
constant gap.
We focus on real time-invariant frequency-ﬂat X-channels, for
which only the degrees-of-freedom are known. We propose a new
communication scheme and show that it achieves the capacity
of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To aid in
this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel model,
admitting a wider range of achievable schemes that can be
translated to the Gaussian channel. For this deterministic model,
we ﬁnd an approximately optimal communication scheme. We
then translate this scheme for the deterministic channel to the
original Gaussian X-channel and show that it achieves capacity
to within a constant gap. This is the ﬁrst constant-gap result for
a fully-connected network requiring interference alignment.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Interference alignment has been shown to be a key technique to achieve optimal degrees-of-freedom (capacity prelog factor) in several common wireless network conﬁgurations such as X-channels [1], interference channels [2], [3],
multi-user systems with delayed feedback [4], and distributed
computation [5], among others. The main idea of interference
alignment is to force all interfering signals at the receivers to
be aligned, thereby maximizing the number of interferencefree signaling dimensions.
For time-invariant frequency-ﬂat channels, as considered
in this paper, this alignment can be achieved in the signal
scale [3], [6]. Using lattice codes, the transmitted and received
signals are split into several superimposed layers. The transmitted signals are chosen such that all interfering signals are
observed within the same layers at the receivers. Signal-scale
interference alignment can be subdivided into two different,
and seemingly completely unrelated, approaches: alignment
schemes motivated by signal-strength deterministic models
[6], [7] and real interference alignment [3].
For the signal-strength deterministic approach introduced
in [8], the channel is ﬁrst approximated by a deterministic
noise-free channel. In this deterministic model, all channel

signal-strength deterministic approach, no vector space interpretation is known for real interference alignment, making it
harder to obtain intuition. On the other hand, it is known that
the degrees-of-freedom of the interference channel itself is
an everywhere discontinuous function of the channel realizations [9]. It should therefore not be surprising that the rates
achieved by real interference alignment share this characteristic. Rather, it appears that the degrees-of-freedom capacity
approximation is too weak to make accurate predictions about
the behavior of channel capacity at ﬁnite signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs), and that the everywhere discontinuity of the degreesof-freedom in the channel coefﬁcients are mainly caused by
taking a limit as SNR approaches inﬁnity. Thus, a stronger
capacity approximation is needed.
In this paper, we derive such a stronger capacity approximation for the Gaussian X-channel by characterizing its
capacity to within a constant gap independent of the SNR
and the channel gains, up to an (easily computable) “outage” set of channel realizations of arbitrarily small measure.
In order to obtain this approximation result, we develop a
novel deterministic channel model. In this deterministic model,
each channel gain is modeled by a lower-triangular binary
Toeplitz matrix. The entries in this matrix consist of the ﬁrst
1
2 log(SNR) bits in the binary expansion of the channel gain
in the corresponding Gaussian model. This contrasts with the
traditional deterministic model, which is based only on the
single most-signiﬁcant nonzero bit in the binary expansion
of the Gaussian channel gain. The proposed deterministic
model is rich enough to explain the real interference alignment
approach. Thus, it unites the so far disparate deterministic and
real interference alignment approaches mentioned above.
The solution for the proposed deterministic X-channel is
simple enough to be mimicked for the original Gaussian
channel. We show that this scheme achieves the capacity of
the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To prove
achievability for the Gaussian case, we extend Groshev’s
theorem to handle ﬁnite SNRs as well as channel gains of
different magnitudes. To derive the constant-gap approximation of capacity, we introduced a new outer bound on the sum
capacity of the Gaussian X-channel. In addition, we show that,
similarly to the Gaussian point-to-point channel, capacity is
not sensitive to channel quantization and measurement errors
smaller than SNR−1/2 .
One implication of these results is that the complicated
solution achieving the degrees-of-freedom of the Gaussian Xchannel in [7] is a result of oversimpliﬁcation in the signalstrength deterministic model rather than the properties of the
original Gaussian channel itself. Moreover, the results in this
paper imply that the discontinuity of the degrees-of-freedom of
the Gaussian X-channel with respect to the channel coefﬁcients
is due to the large SNR limit and is not present at ﬁnite SNRs.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II formally deﬁnes the Gaussian X-channel and introduces
a deterministic channel model approximating it. Section III
presents the main results of the paper. Section IV concludes

the paper.
Due to space constraints, results are presented here without
proof. These can be found in the full version of the paper [10].
II. N ETWORK M ODEL
The Gaussian X-channel consists of two transmitters and
two receivers. The channel output ym at receiver m ∈ {1, 2}
and time t ∈ N is
ym [t]

2nm1 hm1 x1 [t] + 2nm2 hm2 x2 [t] + zm [t],

(1)

where xk [t] is the channel input at transmitter k ∈ {1, 2},
where 2nmk hmk is the channel gain from transmitter k to
receiver m, and where zm [t] ∼ N (0, 1) is additive white Gaussian receiver noise. The channel gains consist of two parts,
2nmk and hmk . The parameter nmk captures the magnitude
or coarse structure of the channel gain, the parameter hmk
captures the ﬁne structure of the channel gain. We assume
that nmk ∈ Z+ and that hmk ∈ (1, 2] for each m, k. Since
2nmk hmk varies over (2nmk , 2nmk +1 ] when hmk varies over
(1, 2], we see that any real channel gain greater than one can be
written in this form. Channel gains with magnitude less than
one are not relevant for a constant-gap capacity approximation,
and hence are ignored here. Similarly, negative channel gains
have no effect on the achievable schemes and outer bounds
presented later, and are therefore ignored as well. In other
words, (1) models essentially the general Gaussian X-channel.
Denote by

n21 n22
the collection of channel parameters.
Each transmitter has one message to communicate to each
receiver. So there are a total of four messages, denoted by wmk
for m, k ∈ {1, 2}. We impose a unit average power constraint
on each transmitted signal. Deﬁne the sum capacity C(N ) of
the Gaussian X-channel in the usual way.
In the following, we will be interested in a particular modulation scheme for the Gaussian channel, which we describe
next. Fix a time slot t; to simplify notation, we will drop in the
following the dependence of variables on t whenever there is
no risk of confusion. Assume each message wmk is modulated
into the signal umk of the form
∞

[umk ]i 2−i

with [umk ]i ∈ {0, 1}. Transmitter one forms the channel input
x1

h22 u11 + h12 u21 .

Similarly, transmitter two forms the channel input
x2

h11 u22 + h21 u12 .

Since |hmk | ≤ 2 and |umk | ≤ 1/4, this satisﬁes the unit
average power constraint at the transmitters.
The received signals are then given by
y1 = 2n11 g11 u11 + 2n12 g12 u12 + g10 (2n11 u21 + 2n12 u22 ) + z1 ,
y2 = 2n22 g22 u22 + 2n21 g21 u21 + g20 (2n22 u12 + 2n21 u11 ) + z2 ,

(see Figs. 1 and 2). Since gmk ∈ (1, 2] by assumption, the
¯

diagonal values of Gmk are equal to one. The matrix G1k is

of dimension n11 ×n11 and G
all k ∈ {0, 1, 2}. A more detailed description and derivation
of this lower-triangular deterministic channel model can be
found in the full version of the paper [10].

Since hmk ∈ (1, 2], we have gmk ∈ (1, 4]. Receiver one is
interested in the signals u11 and u12 . The other two signals
u21 and u22 are interference. We see that the interfering signals
u21 and u22 are received with the same coefﬁcient g10 . The
situation is analogous at the second receiver.
To gain intuition for the modulated Gaussian X-channel,
we develop a corresponding deterministic channel model. It
turns out that existing deterministic models, such as the one
introduced by Avestimehr et al. in [8], are not sufﬁcient for
the purpose of approximating the Gaussian X-channel. Instead,
we introduce a novel deterministic channel model, referred to
as lower-triangular deterministic model.
For ease of exposition, we assume in the following that the
direct links are stronger than the cross links1 , i.e.,

The main result of this paper is a constant-gap approximation of the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel. To develop
intuition, we start with the analysis of the deterministic Xchannel. The next theorem provides an approximate charac¯

Theorem 1 approximates the capacity of the modulated
deterministic X-channel (2) up to a constant gap for all channel
gains gmk ∈ (1, 2] except for a set B of arbitrarily small
measure. The event (gmk ) ∈ B can be interpreted as an
outage event, as in this case the proposed achievable scheme
fails to deliver the target rate of D(N ) − 2 log(c1 /δ). Here δ
parametrizes the trade-off between the measure of the outage
event and the target rate: decreasing δ decreases the measure
of the outage event B, but at the same time also decreases the
target rate D(N ) − 2 log(c1 /δ). We point out that δ can be
chosen independently of the number of input bits N , hence
the approximation gap is uniform in N .
We now provide a sketch of the communication scheme
achieving the lower bound in Theorem 1 (see Figs. 3 and 4).

or irrationality of the channel gains hmk is largely irrelevant

IV. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we derived a constant-gap capacity approximation for the Gaussian X-channel. This derivation was aided
by a novel deterministic channel model used to approximate
the Gaussian channel. In the proposed deterministic channel
model, the actions of the channel are described by a lowertriangular Toeplitz matrix with coefﬁcients determined by the
bits in the binary expansion of the corresponding channel gain
in the original Gaussian problem. This is in contrast to traditional deterministic models, in which the actions of the channel
are only dependent on the single most-signiﬁcant bits of the
channel gains in the original Gaussian problem. Preserving
this dependence on the ﬁne structure of the Gaussian channel
gains turned out to be crucial to approximate the Gaussian
X-channel by a deterministic channel model.
This paper focused on the Gaussian X-channel as an example of a fully-connected communication network in which
interference alignment seems necessary. The hope is that the
tools developed in this paper can also be used to analyze more
general networks requiring interference alignment. Ultimately,
the goal should be to move from degrees-of-freedom capacity
approximations to stronger constant-gap capacity approximations.

Theorem 2 provides a constant-gap capacity approximation
for the Gaussian X-channel. The constant in the approximation
is uniform in the channel gains hmk ∈ (1, 2] except for a set B
of arbitrarily small measure, and uniform in N . The event B
can again be interpreted as an outage event, and δ parametrizes
the trade-off between the measure of the outage event B and
the target rate. Since δ can be chosen independently of N ,
the approximation gap is uniform in the channel SNRs, i.e.,
uniform in 22nmk . Comparing Theorem 2 with Theorem 1, we
see furthermore that, up to a constant gap, the Gaussian Xchannel and its lower-triangular deterministic approximation
have the same capacity.
The lower bound in Theorem 2 is achieved by encoders
and decoders that have access to only a max{nmk }-bit quantization ˆ mk of the channel gains hmk . These encoders and
h
decoders are mismatched in the sense that they are operating
ˆ
under the assumption that hmk is the correct channel gain. This
shows that the proposed communication scheme is quite robust
with respect to channel estimation and quantization errors.

the values of h11 and h22 are both ﬁxed to 1.5. Points shown in black in the
ﬁgure belong to the set B.

Remark: It is worth pointing out that the set B in Theorem 2
can be explicitly computed: Given channel gains hmk , there
is an algorithm that can determine in bounded time if these
channel gains are in the outage set B. More precisely, B is
the union of 2Θ(max{nmk }) strips (see Fig. 5). Membership
of (hmk ) in the outage set B is mostly determined by the
Θ(max{nmk }) most-signiﬁcant bits in the binary expansion
of the channel gains hmk . In particular, for any ﬁnite N
