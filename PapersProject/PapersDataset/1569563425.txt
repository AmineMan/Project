On Optimal Signaling over Secure MIMO Channels
Sergey Loyka, Charalambos D. Charalambous

is a convex optimization problem (so that all powerful tools
of convex optimization apply [11]). Corollary 1 reﬁnes the
estimate of the optimal covariance matrix rank given in [10]
for the general case.

Abstract—Optimal signalling over the wire-tap MIMO Gaussian channel is studied under the total transmit power constraint.
A direct proof of the necessary condition of optimality (signaling
on the positive directions of the difference channel) is given
using the necessary KKT conditions. Based on it, an explicit,
closed-form solution for the optimal transmit covariance matrix
is given when the latter is of the full rank. The cases of weak
eavesdropper and high SNR are considered. It is shown that
the optimal covariance does not converge to a scaled identity in
the latter regime. A reﬁned estimate of the rank of an optimal
covariance matrix is given for the general case.

Let us consider the standard wire-tap Gaussian MIMO
channel model,
y1 = H1 x + ξ1 ,

I. I NTRODUCTION

y2 = H2 x + ξ2

(1)

where x = [x1 , x2 , ...xm ]T ∈ C m,1 is the transmitted
complex-valued signal vector of dimension m×1, “T” denotes
transposition, y1(2) ∈ C n,1 are the received vectors at the
receiver (eavesdropper), ξ1(2) is the circularly-symmetric additive white Gaussian noise at the receiver (eavesdropper) (normalized to unit variance in each dimension), H1(2) ∈ C n1(2) ,m
is the n1(2) × m matrix of the complex channel gains between
each Tx and each receive (eavesdropper) antenna, n1(2) and
m are the numbers of Rx (eavesdropper) and Tx antennas
respectively. The channels H1(2) are assumed to be quasistatic
(i.e., constant for a sufﬁciently long period of time so that
the inﬁnite horizon information theory assumption holds) and
frequency-ﬂat, with full channel state information (CSI) at the
Rx and Tx ends.
For a given transmit covariance matrix R = E {xx+ },
where E {·} is statistical expectation, the maximum achievable
secure rate between the Tx and Rx (so that the rate between
the Tx and eavesdropper is zero) is [5]-[10]

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture has
gain prominence in both academia and industry as a spectrallyefﬁcient approach to wireless communications [1]. With wide
deployment of wireless networks, security issues have recently
gained additional importance, including information-theoretic
approach at the physical layer [2]. The physical-layer security
in MIMO systems has been recently under active investigation [3]-[10]. It was demonstrated that Gaussian signaling is
optimal over the wire-tap Gaussian MIMO channels [6]-[10]
and the optimal transmit covariance has been found for MISO
systems [3] or in the 2-2-1 system [7] under the total power
constraint and in the general MIMO case under the transmit
covariance matrix constraint [5]. The high-SNR regime (SNR
→ ∞) has been studied in [9]. The general case is still
an open problem under the total power constraint, since the
underlying optimization problem is not convex and explicit
solutions are not known, except for some special cases. The
main contribution of this paper is an explicit, closed-form
solution for the optimal full-rank covariance under the total
power constraint at ﬁnite SNR (Theorem 2). Theorem 1 sets
the foundation for this giving a direct proof (via the necessary
KKT conditions) to a necessary condition of optimality, which
is a transmission of the positive directions of the difference
channel. The cases of high-SNR and of weak eavesdropper are
elaborated in Corollaries 3 and 4. The optimal covariance of
Theorem 2 is shown to have some properties similar to those
of the conventional water-ﬁlling, but with a few remarkable
differences. In particular, the optimal covariance does not
converge to a scaled identity in the high-SNR case and thus
isotropic signaling is sub-optimal in this regime. Proposition
1 shows that a transmission on the positive eigenspace of
the difference channel satisﬁes the necessary condition and

C(R) = ln

capacity subject to the total Tx power constraint is

where PT is the total transmit power (also the SNR since the
noise is normalized). It is well-known that the problem in (3)
is not convex in general and explicit solutions for the optimal
Tx covariance are not known except for some special cases
(e.g. low-SNR or MISO channels). It was conjectured in [10]
that an optimal transmission in (3) is on the directions where
the main channel is stronger than the eavesdropper one (i.e. on
the positive directions of the difference channel W1 − W2 ).
A similar conclusion, albeit in a different (indirect) form, has
been obtained in [9] using the degraded channel approach.

this fact using the necessary KKT conditions, which is also

The following Theorem gives a necessary condition of the
optimality in (3).
Theorem 1: Let R∗ be an optimal covariance in (3),

|I + W1+ R|
|I + W2+ R|

(6)

(7)

and let ui+ be its active eigenvector (i.e. corresponding to a
positive eigenvalue). Then,

and Wi+ = P+ Wi P+ , P+ = U+ U+ is the projection
+
matrix on the positive eigenspace of W1 − W2 , U+ is a
semi-unitary matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of
W1 − W2 corresponding to its positive eigenvalues: W+ =
U+ D+ U+ > 0, and D+ is the diagonal matrix of the positive
+
eigenvalues. The optimal (maximizing) covariance R′ in (5)
satisﬁes

u+ (W1 − W2 )ui+ > 0
i+

span{vi+ (R′ )} ∈ span{vi+ (W1 − W2 )}

R∗ = arg max C(R) s.t. trR ≤ PT
R≥0

(4)

where {vi+ (R)} denotes a set of eigenvectors corresponding
to positive eigenvalues of matrix R.
Proof: see Appendix.
It follows from (6) that the transmission takes places on the
projected channels Wi+ = P+ Wi P+ . It should be noted that
the eigenvectors of the optimal covariance R′ in (5) are not
necessarily the same as those of W+ . Rather, they span the
same sub-space. In one special case, R′ and W+ do have the
same eigenvectors.
Corollary 2: Consider the secure MIMO channel in (1) such
that rank(W+ ) = 1. Then

i.e. a necessary condition for an optimal signaling strategy in
(3) is to transit over the positive directions of W1 −W2 (where
the legitimate channel is stronger than the eavesdropper) 1 .
Proof: see the Appendix.
It was demonstrated in [10] that rank(R∗ ) < m unless
W1 > W2 2 , i.e. an optimal transmission is of low-rank
over a non-degraded channel. The Corollary below gives more
precise characterization.
Corollary 1: Let W1 − W2 = W+ + W− , where
W+(−) collects positive (negative and zero) eigenmodes of
W1 − W2 (found from its eigenvalue decomposition). Then,
rank(R∗ ) ≤ rank(W+ ) ≤ m, i.e. the rank of an optimal
covariance R∗ does not exceed the number of positive eigenvalues of W1 − W2 (the rank of W+ ).
Proof: follows from (4) using the fact that the eigenvectors
ui+ are orthogonal to each other.
When rank(W+ ) = 1, the optimal covariance R∗ and
capacity follow from Corollary 13 :
Cs = ln λ1 , R∗ = PT u1 u+
1

(8)

R′ = PT u+ u+
+

(9)

where u+ is the only active eigenvector of W+ (corresponding
to a positive eigenvalue), i.e. the optimal transmission is
unique and on the positive eigenvector of W+ with the full
available power.
Proof: follows immediately from Proposition 1.
The problem in (6) has further signiﬁcance: while the
problem Cs = maxR≥0 C(R) is not convex, so that powerful
tools of convex optimization [11] cannot be used, the problem
maxR≥0 C+ (R) is convex, to which all machinery of convex
optimization can be applied. The following proposition makes
this precise.
Proposition 2: C+ (R) is a non-negative, concave and
non-decreasing function of R (strictly positive, concave and
increasing when the active eigenmodes of R are in the span
of the active eigenmodes of W+ ).
Proof: see Appendix.
It follows from Proposition 2 that transmission with the full
available power is optimal: trR′ = PT .
Let us now consider the original problem in (3) and obtain
its solution R∗ when the latter is of full rank.

(5)

where λ1 , u1 are the largest eigenvalue and corresponding
eigenvector of (I+PT W2 )−1 (I+PT W1 ) or, equivalently, the
largest generalized eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector
of (I + PT W1 , I + PT W2 ), so that transmit beamforming
on u1 is the optimal strategy. Note that this result is more
general than those in [3][7] as the latter two apply to a single
antenna channel (either at the receiver or eavesdropper) while
the result above holds for any number of antennas at any
end. Furthermore, the signaling at (5) is also optimal for any
rank(W+ ) ≥ 1 at low SNR, where λ1 , u1 become the largest
eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of W1 − W2 .
One way to achieve the necessary condition in (4) is to
transmit over the positive eigenspace of W1 − W2 , as the
following Proposition shows.

Theorem 2: Consider the case of W1 > W2 > 0 (a
degraded full-rank channel) and PT > PT 0 , where PT 0 is a
certain threshold power (i.e. sufﬁciently high but ﬁnite SNR).
Then, R∗ is of full rank and is given by:

(≥ instead of >) was independently established in [14].
2 W > W means that W − W is positive deﬁnite.

mind, the conditions of Theorem 2 are both sufﬁcient and
necessary for an optimal covariance to be of full-rank.
It is instructive to consider the case when the required channel is much stronger than the eavesdropper one, W1 ≫ W2 ,
meaning that all eigenvalues of W1 are much larger those of
W2 .

that the columns of U1 are the eigenvectors, and the diagonal

Proof: see Appendix.
An interpretation of (15) is immediate: the ﬁrst term is the
standard water-ﬁlling on the eigenmodes of W1 (which is the
capacity-achieving strategy for the regular MIMO channel)
and the second term is a correction due to the secrecy
requirement: those modes that spill over into the eavesdropper
channel get less power to accommodate the secrecy requirement.
Let us know consider the high-SNR regime.

where Λ2 = Λ1 + diag{µi }. PT 0 can be found as a unique
solution of the following equation:
λ1min (PT 0 )λmin (W1 ) = 1
where λ1min = mini {λ1i } and λmin (W1 ) is the minimum
eigenvalue of W1 .
Proof: see Appendix.
It should be pointed out that Theorem 2 gives an exact
(not approximate) optimal covariance at ﬁnite SNR (no PT →
∞) since PT 0 is a ﬁnite constant that depends only on W1
and W2 and can be found numerically (in fact, it can be not
high at all, depending on W1 and W2 ). Corollary 4 below
makes a more concrete statement. 1st term in (13) C∞ =
|W1 |
ln |W2 | is SNR-independent and the 2nd one ∆C = ln |Λ1 | <
|Λ2 |
0 monotonically increases with the SNR. Furthermore, Cs →
C∞ , ∆C → 0 as PT → ∞, in agreement with Theorem 2 in
[9].
Note also that the second term in (10) de-emphasizes weak
eigenmodes of W1 . Since λ is monotonically decreasing as PT
increases (this follows from (12)), λ1i monotonically increases
with PT , and approaches λ1i ≈ µi /λ at sufﬁciently high
SNR, which is in contrast with the conventional water-ﬁlling
(WF), where the uniform power allocation is optimal at high
SNR. Furthermore, it follows from (11) that λ1i increases
−1
−1
with µi , i.e. stronger eigenmodes of W2 − W1 (which
correspond to larger eigenmodes of W1 and weaker ones of
W2 ) receive larger power allocation, which follows the same
tendency as the conventional WF. It further follows from (9)
that when W1 and W2 have the same eigenvectors, R∗ also
has the same eigenvectors, i.e. the optimal signaling is on the
eigenvectors of W1(2) . While the necessary condition for fullrank R∗ (W1 > W2 ) has been obtained before in [10], no
solution was found for R∗ , which is given in Theorem 2 here.
The condition W2 > 0 can be further removed via a limiting
transition W2ǫ = W2 + ǫI → W2 as ǫ → 0+ . The case
of singular W1 can also be included by observing that R∗
puts no power on the null space of W1 so that all matrices
can be projected, without loss of generality, on the positive
eigenspace of W1 and Theorem 2 will apply. With this in

Proof: follows from Theorem 2 along the same lines as that
of Corollary 3.
Note that the optimal signaling is on the eigenmodes of

−1
W2 − W1 with the optimal power allocation given by
{di }. This somewhat resembles the conventional water-ﬁlling,
but also has a remarkable difference: unlike the conventional
WF, the secure WF in (17) does not converge to the uniform
one in the high-SNR regime 4 . However, strong eigenmodes
−1
−1
of W2 − W1 (which corresponds to weak modes of W2
and strong ones of W1 ) do get more power, albeit in a form
different from that of the conventional WF.
4 The sub-optimality of the isotropic signalling suggested in Theorem 2 of
[9] is hiding in the o(1) term there. 2nd term of Eq. (18) above reﬁnes that
o(1) term.

MR = 0, λ(trR − PT ) = 0,

Optimal signalling over the wire-tap Gaussian MIMO channel has been studied under the total power constraint. Based on
the necessary condition of the optimality, an explicit, closedform solution is given for the optimal transmit covariance
when the latter is of full rank. While the optimal signalling
has some similarities to the conventional water-ﬁlling, it also
reveals a number of differences: the optimal signalling does
not converge to isotropic at high SNR. The weak eavesdropper
and high-SNR regimes were considered, and a reﬁned estimate
of the rank of the optimal covariance matrix is given for the
general case.

where (20) is obtained from ∂L/∂R = 0,
∂L/∂R = (I+W2 R)−1 W2 −(I+W1 R)−1 W1 +λI−M = 0
(22)
and the two equalities in (21) are the complementary slackness
conditions. Since the original problem is not convex, the KKT
conditions are not sufﬁcient for optimality [11]. However,
since the (afﬁne) constraints trR ≤ PT , R ≥ 0 clearly
satisfy the Slater condition [11][12] and since the maximum
is achievable (since the constraint set is compact and the
objective function is continuous), the KKT conditions are
necessary for optimality [12]. We further need the following
technical Lemma.
Lemma 1: Let A, B, C ≥ 0 be positive semi-deﬁnite
matrices and let ABC be Hermitian. Then ABC ≥ 0.
Proof: Since A, C ≥ 0, there exists a non-singular matrix
S such that SAS+ = Da ≥ 0, SCS+ = Dc ≥ 0 are diagonal
[13]. Using the latter,

ABC = SDa BDc S+
where B = S+ BS ≥ 0. Observe further that

λi (Da BDc ) = λi ((Dc Da )1/2 B(Dc Da )1/2 ) ≥ 0

(since (Dc Da )1/2 B(Dc Da )1/2 ≥ 0), where λi (B) means
an eigenvalue of matrix B. Since Da BDc is Hermitian
(because ABC is) and has non-negative eigenvalues, it is
positive semi-deﬁnite [13], Da BDc ≥ 0. It follows that
ABC = SDa BDc S+ ≥ 0. Q.E.D.
Note that this Lemma is a generalization of a well known
fact: AB ≥ 0 if A, B ≥ 0 and AB is Hermitian [13]. We
further prove that Z = (I + W1 R)(I + RW2 ) > 0 when
R > 0; the case of singular R will follow from the standard
continuity argument [13]. Assuming R > 0,
Z = (R−1 + W1 )R2 (R−1 + W2 )

(23)

Now identify the right-hand side of (23) with A, B, C and
use Lemma 1 to obtain Z ≥ 0 (noting that Z is Hermitian
from (20)). Therefore, it follows from (20) that W1 − W2 +
M ≥ 0 (since λ > 0, as λ = 0 implies W1 ≤ W2
and thus Cs = 0 - trivial case not considered here). Since
|(I + W1 R)(I + RW2 )| > 0, it further follows that Z > 0
and W1 −W2 +M > 0. Now, let ui+ be an active eigenvector
(corresponding to a positive eigenvalue) of R∗ . Then,

where R+ = P+ RP+ is the projected covariance. Any

Proof of Proposition 2: We will need the following technical Lemma.
Lemma 2: Consider the function
f (X) = ln I − B(A + X)−1 B ,

Furthermore,

where A, B, X ≥ 0 are positive semi-deﬁnite matrices, I is the
identity matrix, BA−1 B ≤ I. It has the following properties:
1) f (X) is increasing in X: X1 ≤ X2 → f (X1 ) ≤ f (X2 ).
2) f (X) is concave in X:

R2 − R1 = W2 − W1 = U(Λ2 − Λ1 )U+

so that the columns of U are also the eigenvectors of

W2 −W1 and the diagonal entries of Λ2 −Λ1 = diag{µi }
are its eigenvalues. Combining the latter with (29), one
f (αX1 + βX2 ) ≥ αf (X1 ) + βf (X2 ),
obtains after some manipulations (11). (10) follows from
−1
R1 = W1 + R and R1 = UΛ1 U+ . It is straightforward to
for α + β = 1, 0 ≤ α, β ≤ 1.
Proof: 1st property follows from the (easy to verify) fact see that λ > 0 (otherwise W1 ≤ W2 ), so that transmission
that −B(A+X)−1 B is increasing in X (in the matrix positive with the full power is optimal and (12) follows from the
deﬁnite ordering sense [13]). 2nd one is obtained from the power constraint trR = PT . For (10) to be a valid solution,

we need UΛ1 U+ > W1 . This is insured by observing
following chain argument:
that the left-hand side of (12) is monotonically decreasing
f (αX1 + βX2 ) = ln I − B(A + αX1 + βX2 )−1 B (26) in λ, so that the latter is monotonically decreasing as PT
