even if feedback cost is taken into consideration. A logical next
step is to explore the promising role of feedback in broader
contexts.
In this work, we consider the K-user Gaussian IC with
feedback, where channel coefﬁcients are constant over time
and frequency. We focus on two feedback models: (1) the
received signals of all the receivers are fed back to all of
the transmitters; (2) functions of the received signals are fed
back through a backward Gaussian IC. For all cases that we
consider, we assume the transmitter-receiver links to be fullduplex, i.e., a transceiving user can receive and transmit at the
same time. For the ﬁrst idealistic and not so practical model,
we develop a linear achievable scheme and derive a new upper
bound to show that the fdof is K for all channel realizations
2
that ensure the invertibility of the global channel matrix.
For the second, more realistic, model, we make progress on
the 3-user IC. We develop a feedback strategy that builds on
the interference alignment-and-cancellation idea, and achieves
dof = 3 , almost surely for randomly-drawn channels. For the
2
4-user case, we develop a heuristic algorithm that ﬁnds feedback coding coefﬁcients; we observe through simulations that
4
this algorithm ensures the achievability of 2 for a multitude of
experiments. For an arbitrary K number of users, we identify
a class of channels with speciﬁc spectral properties, where
nontrivial fdof is achievable with a very simple feedback
strategy.
Our results indicate that i) feedback can be used to achieve
the degrees-of-freedom (dof) of an IC in a ﬁnite number of
signaling dimensions and ii) feedback can increase the dof
for some classes of scalar ICs where the non-feedback dof is
either not achievable using linear schemes or is stricly less
than K .

Related Work: Nonfeedback strategies for the K-user
Gaussian IC were studied previously [9], [10], [11], [12]. In
their breakthrough paper, Cadambe and Jafar [9] showed that
interference alignment (IA) [13], can achieve dof = K for
2
vector ICs with arbitrarily large channel diversity, e.g., i.i.d
time-varying channels. This result is tight even if feedback
or relays are used, i.e., the use of relays or feedback does
not provide a DoF gain under the i.i.d. time varying channels
assumption [14]. For the scalar channel case, Motahari et
al. [11] developed a nonlinear IA technique to show that
interestingly dof is K with probability 1, for randomly-drawn
2
channel coefﬁcients. Etkin and Ordentlich [10] showed that
dof is strictly less that K for some class of scalar ICs. In [12],

Abstract—We consider the scalar K-user Gaussian interference channel (IC) with feedback, where channel coefﬁcients
are ﬁxed over time and frequency. We focus on two feedback
models: (1) each receiver feeds back its received signal to all
the transmitters and (2) functions of the received signals are fed
back through a backward IC. We show that the feedback degreesof-freedom (fdof) of the ﬁrst model is K if the global channel
2
matrix is invertible. For the second feedback model, we show that
3
fdof = 2 is achievable for the 3-user IC. Then, we show how
nontrivial fdof can be achieved for the K-user IC, when the global
channel matrix belongs to a speciﬁc spectral family of matrices.
Our achievable schemes are linear and require a ﬁnite number of
signal-space dimensions, contrasting the asymptotic interference
alignment by Cadambe et al. and the real interference alignment
by Motahari et al. Another consequence of feedback is that it
can strictly increase the degrees-of-freedom for some classes of
ICs.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A traditional viewpoint on feedback capacity has been
pessimistic over the past few decades. This is mainly due
to Shannon’s original result [1] which shows that feedback
provides no increase in capacity for discrete memoryless pointto-point channels. Although feedback can indeed increase
the capacity of multiple access channels [2], the increase in
capacity for the Gaussian case is bounded by 1 bit for all
channel parameters [3].
Contrary to the traditional belief on feedback capacity,
recent results show that feedback is of fundamental importance
when communicating over interference channels (ICs) [4], [5],
[6]. Speciﬁcally, this feedback gain is shown to be unbounded,
i.e., the gain can be arbitrarily large for certain channel
parameters. The promising gain due to feedback is further
investigated for more realistic scenarios where feedback cost
is taken into consideration [7], [8]. Vahid et al. in [7] take a
separation approach which models feedback links (backward
channels) as rate-constrained bit pipes, and demonstrate that
under this model, one bit of feedback provides one bit of
capacity increase. In [8] a new strategy is developed that
feeds back through a corresponding backward channel without
the bit-pipe abstraction, and shows that this scheme can
outperform the separation approach. As a consequence, it is
shown that feedback can provide a net increase in capacity

a family of codewords, subject to the power constraint, and
encoding/decoding functions such that the average decoding

III. M AIN R ESULTS
In the following we summarize the main results of our work.
Theorem 1 (Model I): Let H be a global channel matrix,
i.e., [H]mk = hmk and rank(H) = K. Then, the feedback
degrees-of-freedom (fdof) of the scalar K-user IC under model
I is
K
fdof = .

Proof: See Section IV.
Theorem 2 (Model II): Let each hmk be randomly drawn
from a continuous distribution and i.i.d over m and k. More˜
over, let the hmk random coefﬁcients be either correlated with
˜
or drawn independently to hkm . Then the fdof of the scalar
3-user IC under model 2 is
3
fdof = , almost surely.
(6)

Proof: The converse proof follows from that of Theorem 1. See Section V for the achievability.
Theorem 3 (Model II): Let H be a full-rank symmetric
channel matrix with L distinct eigenvalues. Then,

where Xm [n] indicates the encoded signal of transmitter m,
hkm is the “channel processing” coefﬁcient from transmitter
m to receiver k, and Zk [n] denotes zero-mean additive white
Gaussian noise at receiver k with normalized power, i.e.,
Zk ∼ CN (0, 1). We assume an average power constraint on all
transmitted signals E{Xm [n]} = P . We note that the channel
coefﬁcients are assumed ﬁxed over time.
The transmitters generate K independent and uniformly
distributed messages, Wk ∈ {1, 2, · · · , Mk } , ∀k ∈ [K], where
[N ] denotes the set {1, · · · , N }. The encoded signal Xk [n] of

We assume two feedback models in this work and describe
them in the following.

Yetis et al. showed that under linear transceiver assumption,
dof = 1 for scalar ICs. On the other hand, we show that
feedback enables dof = K only with linear strategies that
2
rely on a ﬁnite number of signal-space dimensions.
Feedback strategies were studied by Kramer [4], [5] and
Tandon et al. [15] and Mohaher et al. [16], assuming that
feedback is available from each receiver to its corresponding transmitter. While all of these techniques result in a
signiﬁcant capacity increase for a multitude of interesting
channel regimes, these achieve dof = 1, thereby showing the
suboptimality of the schemes in general. On the other hand, we
consider different feedback conﬁgurations to develop coding
techniques that achieve the optimal dof.

Notice that h(Yi ) − h(Zi ) ≤ log |KYi | and

hand, our feedback strategy is linear and thus shows dof gain
for arbitrary scalar ICs.
Remark 2 (Finite Symbol Extensions): In sharp contrast to
the symbol extended IA schemes and inﬁnite precision real IA
schemes of [9] and [11], when feedback is used, then the full
dof of a channel can be achieved in a ﬁxed number of symbol
extensions.
Remark 3 (Comparison to the non-feedback dof): As an
example, we present a channel matrix where the non-feedback
dof is provably 1 and feedback can provide gain. Note that
H = [1 − 1 − 1; −1 1 − 1; −1 − 1 1] is invertible and hence
fdof = 3 , which improves upon the non-feedback dof = 1.

This completes the proof.
Remark 5: Alternatively, we can use Theorem 1 in [14] to
prove dof ≤ K . We instead derive a new outer bound of

Lemma 1 to prove the converse. Note that Lemma 1 is not
limited to the degrees-of-freedom.

where y[1]
=
[Y1 [1], · · · , YK [1]]T and x[1]
=
T
[X1 [1], · · · , XK [1]] . We ignore the noise, since we are
interested in dof. Under this model, feedback is available
from every receiver to every transmitter and allows each
transmitter to obtain y[1] at time 2. Meanwhile each
transmitter sends another new symbol.
The invertibility assumption on H enables each transmitter
to compute H−1 y[1] = x[1] and therefore decode all of the
other users’ symbols. This observation naturally motivates us
to employ a zero-forcing precoder in the next stage. Notice
that the channel is now a virtual MIMO broadcast channel.
Hence, transmitter k computes the vector H−1 x[1] and sends
its kth component.
The received signal at time 3 is

V. ACHIEVABILITY P ROOF OF T HEOREM 2
We will show that 6 symbols can be transmitted during
4 time slots. During time slot 1 and 2 the transmitters send
the symbol vectors x[1], x[2]; the received signal at receiver
k ∈ [3] and time slot n ∈ [2] is
Yk [n] = hk1 X1 [n] + hk2 X2 [n] + hk3 X3 [n].
In time-slot 2, while the transmitters send the second batch
of symbols, each receiver feeds back an appropriately scaled
version of the previous channel output e.g., Yk [1]. The fed
back signal received at transmitter k is
˜
˜
˜
˜
Ym [2] = h1m Y1 [1] + h2m (b · Y2 [1]) + h3m (c · Y3 [1]), (10)
˜
where for simplicity we assume that hkm = hmk , however, the
following derivations can be carried out to the case, where the
backward channel coefﬁcients are independent to the forward
ones. We design the coding coefﬁcients b and c so that the
X2 [1] component of the signal is cancelled out at transmitters
1 and 3. That way, transmitter 1 can decode transmitter 3’s
symbol and vice versa. Expanding (10), we get

y[3] = H(H−1 x[1]) = x[1].
Meanwhile, the previously-received signals (at time 2) are fed
back to all of the transmitters. Again each transmitter computes
H−1 x[2] and then sends its corresponding component. In timeslot 4, the received signal is y[4] = H(H−1 x[2]) = x[2].
Hence, during 4 time-slots, 2K symbols are transmitted.
Therefore, fdof = K .
2
Remark 4: Observe that our scheme does not require channel diversity. However, it does not either require that the
channels are static, i.e., if H varied across time-slots, then
K
2 would still be achievable through the same scheme.

+ h3m c(h33 X3 [1] + h31 X1 [1] + h32 X2 [1]).

We ﬁrst select coefﬁcients b and c such that the underlined
terms are canceled out at transmitters 1 and 3

B. Converse
Our converse is based on the following lemma that bounds
the rate for any couple of users i, j ∈ [K].
Lemma 1: We have that ∀ i, j ∈ [K] and i = j,

h23 h22 b + h33 h32 c = −h13 h12

Transmitters 1 and 3 will receive as feedback a nonzero
linear combination of X1 [1] and X3 [1], almost surely, when
assuming channels drawn at random and i.i.d. from continuous
distributions that do not have mass around zero. Then, assuming that transmitters 1 and 3 have perfect knowledge of the

Ri + Rj ≤ h(Yi ) − h(Zi )
+ h(Yj , YS |Xi , XS , Vij ) − h(Zj , ZS ),

3

channel and the constants b and c, they can each decode the
other user’s symbols by simply subtracting a scaled version
of X1 [1] and X3 [1] from their received equations. This extra
knowledge is key to establishing alignment of interfering terms
using an extra round of transmissions.
At time 3, transmitter 2 re-sends X2 [1], while transmitter 1 sends α1 X1 [1] + α3 X3 [1] and transmitter 3 sends
γ1 X1 [1] + γ3 X3 [1]. These linear combinations are designed
such that the resulting interference terms of Yk [3] align with
the ones of Yk [1], while enforcing the useful symbols to be
distinguishable. This way, each receiver will be able to decode
the symbol of interest. The received signal at receiver 1 is

nonzero polynomial in the channel coefﬁcients. Then, we use
the following Lemma.
Lemma 2: Let
n
independent
random
variables
X1 , X2 , . . . , .Xn that are drawn from continuous
distributions over R with density functions that do not
have discontinuities around 0. Then, if P (X1 , . . . , Xn ) is a
non-identically zero polynomial of degree d we have that
Pr {P (X1 , . . . , Xn ) = 0} = 0.
Proof: Ommited due to lack of space. See the full version
of the paper [17].
Due to Lemma 2, these polynomials are nonzero almost
surely for channel elements drawn at random and i.i.d. from
continuous distributions, therefore the conditions hold almost
surely.
During time slot 3 the receivers send the corresponding
feedback that allows, the decoding of the second batch of
symbols x[2] in time-slot 4. Again this batch of symbols will
be decodable almost surely. Hence, fdof = 3 is achievable
2
almost surely. This completes the proof.
Remark 6: We would like to note that the above achievability scheme works even if the channel coefﬁcients are varying
across time-slots.

Y2 [3] = h22 X2 [1]

The interference alignment condition for this receiver is
h21 α1 + h23 γ1 = −h21 and h23 γ3 + h21 α3 = −h23 . Accordingly, at receiver 3, we have

We continue our study on the K > 3 case, for which we
develop a heuristic algorithm that ﬁnds coding coefﬁcients
for the feedback strategy. Similar to the 3-user case, we
consider a 4 time transmission scheme, where at each round
we assume that the transmitting end can combine and scale
all the information that it has available. Let at the ﬁrst round
that the transmitters send the K-length vector x[1]. Then, the
received signal at time slot 1 is y[1] = Hx[1]. The receivers
rescale the channel output and feed it back to the transmitter,
ˆ
which receives y[2] = HT D1 Hx[1], where D1 indicates
a K × K diagonal matrix. At timeslot 3, the transmitters
ˆ
combine x[1] with y[2] and x[2], and the received vector is
y[3] = HD2 HT D1 Hx[1]+HD3 x[1], where Di , i ∈ {1, 2, 3}
are all K × K diagonal matrices. Hence, a sufﬁcient condition
for decodability of the ﬁrst batch of symbols is

and its alignment condition is h31 α1 + h33 γ1 = h31 . Solving
the 4 equations in the 4 unknowns α1 , α3 , γ1 , γ3 yields

The decoupling of the equations is possible due to the fact that

Y2 [3] = h22 X2 [1] − h21 X1 [1] − h23 X3 [1],

It is not hard to show that the total number of free variables in
the above multilinear system of equations is equal to 5K − 2.
We expect that this system should be feasible when the number
of unknowns is at most equal to the number of equations,
which is true for K ≤ 4. For the K = 3 case, we obtained
a closed form solution solving linear equations. However, for
the K = 4 case, solving for the unknown diagonals requires
solving intricate multilinear equations, which we cannot do
efﬁciently.

thus ensuring 2 signal dimension per user. On the other hand,
for K > 4, simulations demonstrate the divergence of the
algorithm for all of the 100 experiments. The difﬁculty comes
from the fact that this heuristic formulation approximately
solves O K 2 multilinear equations in O(K) unknowns. In
general, we would not expect such an approach to work for
arbitrary K, unless coding coefﬁcients were carefully designed
to induce signiﬁcant dependencies among these equations.

where the rank constraint enforces that all K symbols are
distinguishable (i.e. nonzero) at the receivers. Due to the
rank constraints and the nonconvex cost function the above
optimization does not seem tractable. To solve it, we relax
it to an alternating convex optimization problem, where we
replace the nonconvex rank constraints with afﬁne ones. Let
g ({Di }) = D4 H + HD2 HT D1 H + HD3 − D5 F , where
A F indicates the Frobenius norm of matrix A. Then, we
use the following (randomized) heuristic.

Our achievable scheme uses 2L number of time-slots to
transmit 2K symbols. The two batches of symbols along
with their corresponding fed back symbols are pipelined
as in the previous 4-time-slot achievability schemes. At
time-slot 1 the transmitters send x[1], while at time-slot
ˆ
2 they send x[2], and they receive as feedback y[2] =
HT Hx[1] = H2 x[1]. Then, at time slot n ∈ {2, . . . , 2L}
the received signals at the receiver side is y[n] = Hˆ [n −
y

1] and y[n] = Hy[n − 1]. This means that after 2L timesolts
the receiver end will have {Hx[1], H3 x[1], . . . , H2L−1 x[1]}
and {Hx[2], H3 x[2], . . . , H2L−1 x[2]}. Using the eigenvalue multiplicity, one can easily show that there exL
