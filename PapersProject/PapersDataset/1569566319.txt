is only shown to be useful to facilitate interference alignment
for some speciﬁc scenarios. For quasi-static channels, references [12]–[14] have proposed strategies to utilize the relay
to randomize the channel coefﬁcients at the receivers, and the
optimal DoF can be achieved although the channel is not time
varying within the transmission blocks. Reference [15] has
proposed relay-aided interference alignment schemes that can
achieve the optimal DoF of the K-user interference channel
with ﬁnite time extensions. For networks that are not fully
connected, the study on DoF for multi-hop relay networks can
be found in reference [16]. For networks that have limited CSI,
it is shown in reference [17] that using a relay, the maximum
DoF for the K-user interference channel can be achieved when
all the nodes only have local CSI, provided that the relay
has more antennas than the total number of single-antenna
transmitters.
Given all these efforts, it is interesting to ask whether
relaying can help to achieve the maximum DoF, when no
CSIT is available in the channel. Our recent work [18] has
considered the 2-user X channel without CSIT, and has shown
that a half-duplex relay can facilitate interference alignment to
achieve the optimal DoF 4 . This can be accomplished using
3
either (i) a relay with two antennas and delayed CSI, or (ii) a
relay with one antenna and full CSI. In this work, we consider
the general K-user X channel with half-duplex relays, and
we show that when relays have full CSI, the optimal DoF
K2
2K−1 can be achieved using one relay with K − 1 antennas,
or (K − 1)2 single-antenna relays. For the case when the
relay has K − 1 antennas, we develop a transmission scheme
using partial interference alignment at the relay and joint
beamforming between the relay and the transmitters to achieve
the optimal DoF. For the case when relays only have one
antenna, we use joint beamforming between the transmitters
and the relays to align the interference at the receivers. We
further show that when the relays only have delayed CSI, the
K2
maximum DoF is strictly less than 2K−1 in general except for
the case when K = 2.

Abstract—This paper investigates the impact of half-duplex
relays on the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the K-user X channel
when the transmitters are blind in the sense that no channel
state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) is available. It
is shown that adding relay nodes with CSI to the communication
model is sufﬁcient to recover the optimal DoF with CSIT.
In particular, the relay nodes help steer the directions of the
transmitted signals to facilitate interference alignment to achieve
optimal DoF. It is shown that one relay node with K −1 antennas
is sufﬁcient to achieve the optimal DoF. When relays do not have
multiple antennas, it is sufﬁcient to have (K − 1)2 relays to
achieve the optimal DoF. The achievability is established using
partial interference alignment and joint beamforming. DoF for
the case when relays only have delayed CSI is also investigated.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Interference alignment has been shown to be a useful
technique to achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF)
for various wireless network models [1]–[3]. To effectively
implement interference alignment, it is crucial to have global
instant channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters
(CSIT), denoted as full CSI/CSIT here onward, and is usually
hard to obtain for practical systems.
When there is no CSIT in the system, loss of DoF is
observed for many scenarios of interest in references [4], [5].
Recognizing the difﬁculty of obtaining full CSIT, references
[6], [7] have studied the cases when only the channel correlation structure is known at the transmitters and have proposed
interference alignment schemes using the channel correlation
to achieve the optimal DoF. On the other hand, considering
the time varying nature of wireless channels and the delay in
the feedback of CSI, reference [8] has investigated the K-user
broadcast channel, where CSIT is known at the transmitters
with one slot delay. Under this assumption, it is shown that
delayed CSIT can provide DoF gain compared to the case
when no CSIT is available. However, it cannot achieve the
same optimal DoF as when full CSIT is available. This delayed
CSIT assumption is also applied to other channel models, and
the study on its impact to the DoF can be found in [9], [10]
and the references therein.
Relaying, although useful to improve the achievable rates
for many wireless networks, is shown to be unable to provide
DoF gain for fully connected interference channel and X
channel with full CSI at all nodes [11]. In this context, relaying

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
For the K-user X channel, we have K transmitter-receiver
pairs, and each transmitter has a message to be communicated
with each receiver. It is assumed that the transmitters and

1

receivers are equipped with a single antenna. There are J
half-duplex relays with L antennas available to help the
transmission. We denote wnm as the message from transmitter
m = 1, · · · , K to receiver n = 1, · · · , K. The transmitted
signal from transmitter m is denoted as Xm (t) ∈ C and the
transmitted signal from relay Rj is denoted as XRj (t) ∈ CL ,
where j = 1, · · · , J and t is the time index denoting the slot
in which the signal is transmitted.
When the relays listen to the channel, the received signals
at the receivers are
Yn (t) =

K
∑

hnm (t)Xm (t) + Zn (t)

Proposition 1: For the 3-user X channel, when there is no
9
CSIT, maximum DoF 5 is achievable using a relay with 2
antennas and full CSI.
Proof: We assume that the data stream from transmitter
i to receiver j is denoted as dji , i, j = 1, 2, 3. To achieve the
9
DoF 5 , we use a transmission scheme that spans 5 slots, in
which a total of 9 independent data streams can be transmitted
to the receivers, and each receiver can distinguish 3 of the
data streams in an interference-free fashion. We also assume
that the channel is time varying, i.e., each slot has a different
channel realization, and the channel coefﬁcients are drawn
from a continuous distribution.
In the ﬁrst 3 slots, the transmitters send messages to the
receivers, and the relay keeps silent. Speciﬁcally, in slot t, all
the 3 transmitters send the messages intended for receiver t:
Xk (t) = dtk , where t, k = 1, 2, 3. The received signals at the
receivers and the relay for slot t are

m=1

and the received signals at the relays are

hRj m (t)Xm (t) + ZRj (t).

Ym (t) = hm1 (t)dt1 + hm2 (t)dt2 + hm3 (t)dt3 ,
YR (t) = hR1 (t)dt1 + hR2 (d)t2 + hR3 (t)dt3

When the relays transmit, the received signals at the receivers are

(5)

where m = 1, 2, 3, and the noise is omitted since we are
considering the DoF.
In the remaining 2 slots, we need to provide each receiver
with another two equations such that the intended messages,
which are unknown variables dtk , can be recovered. In the
meantime, all the interference data streams must be kept in a
2-dimensional space at each receiver to achieve the maximum
DoF. Since the relay only has 2 antennas, it cannot separate
the 3 messages from the transmitters at each slot. However,
as we show next, the spatial dimensions available at the relay
can still be used to align the interference.
The relay ﬁrst performs linear transformation to the received
signals. For the signal received in slot 1, we choose vectors
u2 (1), u3 (1) ∈ C2 such that

hnRj (t)T XRj (t) + Zn (t).

j=1

In the above expressions, the transmitted signals are subject to average power constraint E(||XRj (t)||2 ) ≤ P ,
E(|Xm (t)|2 ) ≤ P . hnm ∈ C is the channel coefﬁcient from
transmitter m to the receiver n. hRj m (t) ∈ CL is the channel
vector between transmitter m and relay Rj , and hnRj (t) ∈ CL
is the channel vector between relay Rj and receiver n. It is
assumed that the channel coefﬁcients are independently drawn
from a continuous distribution for each time index, and the
channel is time varying. Zn (t) and ZRj (t) are Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, and Gaussian
random vector with zero mean and identity covariance matrix,
respectively.
We assume the rate of message wij is Rij (P ) for power
constraint P . We deﬁne C(P ) as the set of all achievable
rate tuples {Rnm (P )} for power constraint P . The degree
of freedom is deﬁned as

u2 (1)T hR3 (1) = h23 (1)

u3 (1)T hR2 (1) = h32 (1)

u3 (1)T hR3 (1) = h33 (1).

Since we have two variables with two equations and the
channel coefﬁcients are drawn from a continuous distribution,
we can guarantee the existence of u2 (1) and u3 (1) almost
surely. We can then obtain the following signals by taking
the inner products between the vector u2 (1) (u3 (1)) and the
received signal vector from slot 1 at the relay:

u2 (1)T YR (1) = u2 (1)T hR1 (1)d11 + h22 (1)d12 + h23 (1)d13
u3 (1)T YR (1) = u3 (1)T hR1 (1)d11 + h32 (1)d12 + h33 (1)d13 .

For the K-user X channel without CSIT, it is shown in
reference [5] that there is loss of DoF compared to the case
with full CSIT. We show that, with one relay having K − 1
antennas, we are able to align the interference at the receivers
K2
to achieve the DoF 2K−1 , which is the maximum DoF when
CSIT is available in the system [3], [11].
To better illustrate the transmission strategy, we ﬁrst provide
an example for the 3-user X channel with a relay having 2
antennas, and then generalize the result to the K-user case.

These two signals are useful for receiver 1, since they
contain the messages that are intended for it. However, the
messages d1i , i = 1, 2, 3 are interference for receiver 2 and
3. Using the linear transformation provided by vector u2 (1)
and u3 (1), part of the interference is aligned at receiver 2
and receiver 3. Note that we need to keep u2 (1)T YR (1)
away from receiver 3, and keep u3 (1)T YR (1) away from
receiver 2, in order to not introducing additional interference

to the receivers. This can be done by sending u2 (1)T YR (1)
and u3 (1)T YR (1) in the direction orthogonal to h3R (t′ ) and
h2R (t′ ), respectively, where t′ = 4, 5. We can obtain the
vectors u1 (2), u3 (2), u1 (3), u2 (3) in the same fashion, which
result in the following inner products:

In order to transmit the signals along their intended directions, we now deﬁne the following beamforming vectors

Using the linear transformation and beamforming vectors
provided above, interference is only partially aligned. To align
the rest of the interference, we let the relay choose a scaling
factor αij (t) for each signal it wishes to send to the receivers,
which results in the following signal XR (t) to be transmitted
for slot t′ :

where j ̸= t, j ̸= i, and αti (t′ ) are to be determined later.
For these two slots, the transmitters also send the following
signals to the receivers:

where k = 1, 2, 3.
The received signals at the receivers are
Ym (t′ ) =
hm1 (t′ )d11 + hm2 (t′ )d22 + hm3 (t′ )d33 + hmR (t′ )T XR (t′ )
We now focus on all the signals received at receiver 1. If
we combine all the received signals from 5 slots into a vector

The signals d31 , d32 , and d33 can be aligned in a similar
fashion. The rest parameters can be determined using the same
method for the other receivers. It is easy to verify that the data
streams d11 , d12 and d13 occupy the rest 3 dimensional space.
Similar argument holds for receiver 2 and receiver 3 as well.
Therefore using the proposed scheme, we can transmit a total
of 9 messages using 5 slots, which proves the achievability of
DoF 9 .
5
In the transmission scheme, we can see from equation (14)
that if the transmitters remain silent for slots 4 and 5, the
parameters αij (t) will be all zero to keep the interference
aligned. This reduces the total number of dimensions of the
signal space at the receivers to 3. The reason is that, using the
transmission scheme provided above, each set of data streams
intended for one receiver is already aligned in the ﬁrst 3 slots.
To keep all the interference signals aligned in a space of
dimension 2, the relay may choose to do not send anything, if
the transmitters remain silent for the last 2 slots. This will also
keep the intended data streams in a one dimensional space.
However, we need additional signal dimensions to decode the
intended data streams.
To address this issue, we let the transmitters also send data
streams to the receivers for slots 4 and 5. With the additional
data streams, the relay cannot keep the interference aligned
by remaining silent. We call the transmission scheme joint
beamforming.
The essence of the above transmission strategy is to use the
limited spatial dimensions available at the relay to ﬁrst partially align the interference, and then align the rest interference
through joint beamforming with the transmitters.
Using the ideas from the example for the 3-user X channel
with a 2-antenna relay, we can now generalize the result to
the K-user case.
Theorem 1: For K-user X channel, when there is no CSI
available at the transmitters while full CSI is available at the
K2
receivers, maximum DoF 2K−1 is achievable using a relay
with K − 1 antennas and full CSI.

Remark 1: For the K-user X channel without CSIT and
relays, reference [5] has shown that the DoF is upperbounded
by 1 under Rayleigh fading. Our result shows that relaying is
useful to increase the DoF of X channel without the presence
of CSIT.
Remark 2: Reference [3] has shown that with full CSI at
all nodes, the maximum DoF of the K-user X channel is
K2
2K−1 . Reference [11] has further shown that relaying does not
increase the DoF of X channels, when all nodes are equipped
with full CSI. This means that the K-user X channel with
K2
relays has maximum DoF 2K−1 . Our scheme has shown that
without CSIT, we are still able to achieve the maximum DoF
with the help of a relay.

In order to separate the intended data streams from the

another K − 1 dimensions in the signal space to decode the

In the previous section, we have shown that for the K-user
X channel without CSIT, it is sufﬁcient to have one relay with
K − 1 antennas to achieve the maximum DoF of the channel.
In this section, we investigate the case when relays only have
a single antenna, and we study how many relays are needed
to achieve the maximum DoF.
Theorem 2: For the K-user X channel with single antenna
relays, when there is no CSIT but full CSI is available at the
relays and the receivers, a sufﬁcient condition to achieve the
K2
maximum DoF 2K−1 is to have J = (K − 1)2 relays.
Proof: For slots t = 1, 2, · · · , K, the transmitters send
the messages intended for receiver t, and the relays remain
silent. The signal sent from transmitter k = 1, 2, · · · , K for
slot t can be expressed as

the existence of a solution to the set of linear equations. Since
all the relays have full CSI, they can solve the equations
to obtain the scaling factors individually. Using the scaling
factors, it is now easy to verify that all the interfering signals
are aligned into a K − 1 dimensional space, and the intended
data streams occupy the rest K dimensional space, due to the
fact that the channel is time varying and channel coefﬁcients
are drawn from a continuous distribution. We can then decode
the intended messages using a zero-forcing decoder, and the
K2
DoF 2K−1 can be achieved.

R ELAY

In this section, we investigate the impact of relays on DoF
when the relays only have delayed CSI. We consider the Kuser X channel with one (K − 1)-antenna relay, and compare
the DoF of the model with full CSI and the one with delayed
CSI. For the case with delayed CSI, we ﬁrst consider the Kuser X channel with a K-antenna relay, which clearly provides
a DoF upperbound to the case with a (K − 1)-antenna relay.
Theorem 3: For the K-user X channel with a K-antenna
relay, when there is no CSIT and only delayed CSI is available
at the relay, the maximum DoF is

Proof: The achievability of this DoF can be obtained
using a similar strategy as in [8]. The scheme in [8] is designed
for the K-user broadcast channel and consists of K phases,
where in phase 1, the transmitter sends the messages to the
receivers. In slot t = 1, · · · , K for phase 1, the transmitter
T
sends X(t) = (dt1 , dt2 , · · · , dtK ) , where dti is the ith
message intended for receiver t. The transmission scheme used
for this phase can be implemented for the K-user X channel.
Since the relay has K antennas and delayed CSI, it can decode
all the messages, and then it can act as the transmitter in the
broadcast channel to implement the transmission scheme for
the rest of the phases to achieve the DoF speciﬁed by (26).
To upper bound the DoF of the channel, we combine all the
transmitters and the relay, which yields a broadcast channel
with 2K antennas at the transmitter with delayed CSIT. The
outerbounds in references [8] [9] can then be used to obtain
equation (26).
Recall that for the K-user X channel without CSIT, when
K2
the relay has full CSI, we can achieve the full DoF 2K−1 with
only K − 1 antennas at the relay. For the case with delayed
CSI at the relay, when the relay has K − 1 antennas, the DoF
at most equals equation (26). It is clear that for the K-user X
channel without CSIT, full CSI at the relay can provide a DoF
gain, compared to the case with delayed CSI at the relay.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have investigated relay-aided interference
alignment schemes for K-user X channel, when no channel
state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) is available.
For the case when relays have full CSI, we have developed a
