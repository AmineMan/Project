conjectured in [6] that the spatial dimension is similarly scale
invariant: With perfect global channel knowledge and generic
channels, if the number of antennas at each node in a wireless
network is scaled by a common constant factor, then the DoF
of the network (for almost all channel realizations) scale by
the same factor.
The spatial scale invariance conjecture is consistent with
all known DoF results across a wide variety of networks.
For the 2 × 2 user MIMO X channel with A antennas at
each node, the DoF value is known to be 4A [4], [5], which
3
scales with A and is therefore, consistent with the spatial scale
invariance conjecture. Even for the M × N user MIMO X
network with A antennas at each node, if min(M, N ) ≤ 2,
the DoF value is easily seen to be A M M N−1 , again spatial
+N
scale invariant. However, if min(M, N ) > 2, the best known
inner bound for the M × N user X network with A antennas
MN
at each node, is only A M +N − 1 DoF [3], which is not
A
spatial scale invariant. This remarkable distinction between
the min(M, N ) ≤ 2 setting and the min(M, N ) > 2 setting is
mainly because in the former setting the achievability schemes
are based on regular (non-asymptotic) linear schemes, whereas
in the latter setting the asymptotic CJ scheme of [2] is used.
Note that while most achievability schemes based on regular
beamforming naturally scale with the spatial dimension, the
asymptotic CJ scheme of [2] does not.
As the ﬁrst contribution of this work, we establish that for
all M, N , the M ×N user MIMO X network with A antennas
at each node, has A M M N−1 DoF. Additionally, we verify
+N
that the spatial scale invariance property is also valid for SIMO
and MISO X networks as well.
(2) Decomposability: We use the term “decomposition” to
refer to independent processing at each antenna, essentially
splitting a multiple antenna node into multiple independent
single antenna nodes. It was ﬁrst used to simplify the proof
of achievability in the K user symmetric MIMO interference
channel [2] where the DoF result obtained for the SISO setting
was immediately extended to the symmetric MIMO setting by
decomposing the K user MIMO interference network with A
antennas at each node, into an AK user SISO interference
network, where the asymptotic CJ alignment scheme can be
applied to show that AK/2 DoF are achievable, without joint

Abstract—We show that an M × N user MIMO X network
with A antennas at each node has A M M N−1 degrees of free+N
dom (DoF), thus settling the spatial scale invariance conjecture
(scaling the number of antennas at each node by a constant
factor will scale the total DoF by the same factor) for this
class of networks. The previously known best general DoF inner
bound, inspired by the K user interference channel, was based
on the decomposition of every transmitter and receiver into
multiple single antenna nodes, transforming the network into an
AM × AN user SISO X network. While such a decomposition is
DoF optimal for the K user interference channel, a gap remained
between the best inner and outer bound for the MIMO X
channel. Here we close this gap with the new insight that the
MIMO X network is only one-sided decomposable, i.e., either
all the transmitters or all the receivers (but not both) can be
decomposed by splitting multiple antenna nodes into multiple
single antenna nodes without loss of DoF. The result is extended
to SIMO and MISO X networks as well and in each case the DoF
results satisfy the spatial scale invariance property. In addition,
the feasibility of linear interference alignment is investigated
based only on spatial beamforming without symbol extensions.
Similar to MIMO interference networks, we show that when the
problem is improper, it is infeasible.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The use of multiple antennas, known as multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) technology, and the consolidation of
interference, known as interference alignment (IA), are two
of the promising advances of the last two decades that seek
to alleviate the spectrum shortage for wireless communication
networks by making available additional spatial degrees of
freedom (DoF). Taken individually, the understanding of MIMO is by now quite mature, and rapid advances have recently
been made in understanding the essential principles of IA
through DoF studies of a variety of network settings. Taken
together, however, the understanding of MIMO in conjunction
with IA, the understanding of the spatial dimension per se,
is limited by a number of unresolved fundamental issues.
In particular, here we highlight the issues of spatial scale
invariance, decomposability and linear feasibility.
(1) Spatial Scale Invariance: It is well understood that
the DoF of wireless networks are scale-invariant with respect
to time and frequency dimensions. Wang et al. have recently

processing among co-located antennas at any node. Since
AK/2 is also the DoF outer bound for the K user symmetric
MIMO interference network, it is evident that the network is
decomposable, i.e., no loss of DoF results from decomposing
all transmitters and receivers.
The previously best known inner bound for the symmetric
MIMO X network is also based on the decomposition argument and application of the asymptotic CJ alignment scheme.
By decomposing every transmitter and receiver in an M × N
user symmetric MIMO X network with A antennas at each node, we obtain an AM ×AN user symmetric SISO X network,
MN
and therefore the corresponding DoF value, A M +N − 1
A
is achievable. Unfortunately, in the X network setting, this
inner bound did not match the best known outer bound and
therefore, the optimal DoF value remained open. The key to
solving this open problem in this paper, is the new insight that
unlike symmetric MIMO interference networks which are twosided decomposable (i.e., one can decompose all transmitters
and all receivers without loss of DoF), symmetric MIMO
X networks are only one-sided decomposable (i.e., one can
decompose either all transmitters, or all receivers, but not both,
without loss of DoF). While our achievability scheme is still
based on the asymptotic CJ alignment scheme of [2], we use
the extension by Gou and Jafar in [7], of the CJ scheme to
SIMO/MISO settings.
(3) Linear Feasibility: Linear feasibility refers to the
achievability of interference alignment in a network based
only on spatial beamforming, i.e., without symbol extensions.
Starting in the context of interference networks, [9] formulated
the problem as the solvability of a set of multivariate polynomial equations. In [9], the authors deﬁne an IA problem as
improper or proper based on whether or not the number of
equations exceeds the number of involved variables, with the
conjecture that proper systems are likely to be feasible and
improper systems are likely to be infeasible. This conjecture
is recently settled completely in one direction and partially in
the other direction [10], [11]. In particular, it is shown that in
interference channel setting improper systems are infeasible.
In this work, we extend this result into MIMO X setting.
Following the approach of [10], [11], we establish that in
arbitrary (not limited to symmetric) MIMO X networks, the
improperness of polynomial system implies infeasibility of
linear IA as well. A challenging aspect of this contribution
is the derivation of the improperness condition itself, because
the variable counting argument is a bit more involved in the
X setting than in interference channels.

MIMO X network is described by input-output relations
Y[j] (κ) =

H[ji] (κ)X[i] (κ)+Z[j] (κ),

j∈{1,2,··· ,N }

i∈{1,2...M }

where κ represents the channel use index, X[i] (κ) is the Ai ×1
input signal vector of the ith transmitter, Y[j] (κ) is the Bj ×1
output signal vector of the j th receiver and Z[j] (κ) represents
the Bj × 1 additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector
at the j th receiver. The average power at each transmitter
is bounded by ρ and the noise variance at all receivers is
assumed to be equal to unity. H[ji] (κ) represents the Bj × Ai
channel matrix between transmitter i and receiver j at channel
index κ. We assume that all channel coefﬁcient values are
time-varying, i.i.d., drawn from a continuous distribution and
the absolute value of all the channel coefﬁcients is bounded
between a non-zero minimum value and a ﬁnite maximum
value. Perfect knowledge of all channel coefﬁcients is available
to all transmitters and receivers. Let Rji (ρ) = R(ρ) denote
the symmetric achievable rate for each message where ρ is
referred to as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Then the DoF for
message W [ji] is deﬁned as dji = limρ→∞ Rji (ρ)/ log(ρ),
which can be interpreted as independent signaling dimensions
or streams. We use d to denote the symmetric DoF and the
sum DoF is given by η

III. S PATIAL S CALE I NVARIANCE AND D ECOMPOSABILITY
The main result is presented in the following two theorems.
Theorem 1: The M × N user MIMO X network with A
antennas at each node has A M M N−1 DOF.
+N
To grasp the essence of the achievable scheme, let us
provide an intuitive overview with a simple example. Consider
the 3 × 3 MIMO X network with 2 antennas at each node,
i.e., M = N = 3, A = 2, as shown in Figure 1. We split all
the transmit antennas and view them as 6 independent transmitters. Each virtual transmitter selects the same beamforming
matrices (thereby same signal space) Va , Vb , Vc for receiver
a, b, c, respectively, over n symbol extensions. Then the signal
space seen by each receiver has 2n dimensions. In order to
consolidate the interference caused by Va at receiver b, c as
much as possible and because any two transmitters cannot
align with each other, we turn to many-to-many alignment

When considering linear IA without symbol extension, we
assume transmitter i intends to send dji independent streams
to receiver j using a precoding matrix V[ji] of dimension
Ai ×dji . Then receiver j zero-forces all the interference while
keeping all the desired signals with a receive ﬁlter matrix
U[j] of dimension Bj × i dji . The IA solution requires the
simultaneous satisﬁability of the following conditions:

horizontal concatenation of matrices A and B. The IA condition (6) implies that V[ji] and U[j] must have full column
rank.
It is well known that linear IA schemes should satisfy
reciprocity [8]. In the reciprocal network, the direction of com˜

˜
V
i is [V[1i] , V[2i] , ..., V[N i] ] with dimension Ai × j dji . Then
the linear IA feasibility conditions in the reciprocal network
are

where Tji denote the interference-carrying matrices (same as
H[ji] in the ﬁgure). We use Tji , j = 3, 4, 5, 6 here to highlight
they are all the interfering links arriving at receivers b, c caused
by Va (red and black links shown in Figure 1). All the above
conditions can be satisﬁed with the CJ alignment scheme [1]:
Va ≈ Tji Va , ∀i = 1, 2, . . . 6, j = 3, 4, 5, 6.

(4)

Similarly, the three messages for receiver b are sent along the
same signal space Vb and align into the same space Vb ×
Vb at receivers a, c where they constitute interference. Lastly,
Vc × Vc span the total interference space by the messages
intended for receiver c at a, b. The size of the signal spaces
are chosen to be equal, i.e., |Va | = |Vb | = |Vc | = |V|
and then |V × V| = 2|V|. We can easily see that at each
receiver, desired signals occupy 6|V| dimensions from all 6
transmitters and interference (namely signals intended for the
other two receivers) occupies 4|V| dimensions. After aligning
the interference, we need to guarantee the linear independence
of desired signals from interference to ensure decodability,
which is proved in the full paper [12]. Finally, in order to
accommodate all the signals in general positions in the 2n
dimensional signal space at each receiver, we set 10|V| = 2n.
The total accessible DoF for the network equal 3×6|V| = 18 =

The statement of Theorem 1 can be further generalized as
in Theorem 2.
Theorem 2: The M × N user SIMO X network with a
single antenna at each transmitter and R antennas at each
receiver, as well as its reciprocal channel, the N × M MISO
X network, has

the reciprocal channel from transmitter j to receiver i. Also
˜

(8) requires that V[ij] and U[i] are full column rank.
Remark: Note the subtle but essential difference between the
MIMO interference channel and MIMO X network, evident
in the asymmetric form of the feasibility conditions (5) (6)
where only one ﬁlter matrix U[k] is associated with a receiver
and accounts for all received messages, but multiple precoding matrices V[ji] are associated with each transmitter, one
corresponding to each message originating at that transmitter.
Similarly, in the reciprocal network, at receiver i multiple
precoding matrices V[ji] in the original network are combined
˜
into one receiving ﬁlter U[i] , and the receiving ﬁlter U[j] in
the original network are split into multiple matrices as the new
˜
precoding matrices V[ij] .
In the above context, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3: In the M × N user symmetric MIMO X
network where each transmitter is equipped with A and
each receiver is equipped with B antennas, every transmitter
intends to send d DoF to every receiver. If a feasible linear
IA solution exists, the symmetric DoF d must satisfy

MNR
M + NR − R

DoF. In addition, the DoF in both cases satisfy the spatial
scale invariance property.
Note that Theorem 1 is a special case of Theorem 2 when
R = 1 and the scaling factor is speciﬁed by A.

transmitters and the receiver n is no more than max(R, R) =
R. This gives us the outer bound

Remark: The result can be shown for arbitrary antenna
conﬁgurations, without any symmetry assumptions, but is
stated here for the symmetric setting where it can be expressed
in a compact form. The result essentially states that improper
systems are infeasible. The proof is virtually identical to [10],
[11].
Note that since we are only making a claim about “infeasibility” we can over count the variables and still have a
valid, albeit less interesting, result. We will, however, check
if our threshold is tight through some examples. Note from
the recently solved 3 user MIMO interference channel, that
the settings with no redundancy (where neither A nor B can
be reduced without losing DoF) are those ones where the
feasibility condition matches the information theoretic DoF
value.
Example to Check Tightness of Threshold Value: Consider
a 2 × 2 user X channel, where each transmitter is equipped
with 2 antennas and each receiver is equipped with 3 antennas.
We already know that d = 1 is tight here, i.e. information
theoretically there is no redundancy on either side (details will
be shown in the full paper [12]). Also the threshold value from
2+3
our bound (9) is 2×2+1 = 1. This is a good sanity check that
our improper condition is not loose, i.e., the variables are not
being over-counted. More generally, in a 2×K user MIMO X
network, where each transmitter is equipped with K antennas
and each receiver is equipped with K + 1 antennas, we also
know d = 1 is tight and there is no redundant dimension.
Again our bound (9) K+K+1 = 1 is tight as well.

B. Inner Bound on the DoF of MIMO X networks
The achievability of Theorem 1 consists of two parts. The
ﬁrst part is to design a concrete scheme to achieve the DoF for
the SIMO and reciprocal MISO X network, and the second
part is to prove the spatial scale invariance property. We will
prove both one by one.
Proof: When M ≤ R, beamforming and zero forcing are
sufﬁcient to achieve the DoF.
In the SIMO case, as each receiver has enough antennas to
decode all desired messages by zero forcing the interference
from unintended transmitters and messages, each transmitter
can achieve its interfering-free 1 DoF, resulting in a total
of M DoF for the network. In the reciprocal MISO case,
each receiver can also achieve 1 DoF by zero-forcing all the
interference at the transmitter.
When M > R, the achievable scheme is based on separating
the antennas at one side and interference alignment. Due to
the reciprocity of linear beamforming-based alignment, which
states that if interference alignment is feasible on the original
network then it is also feasible on the reciprocal network, and
the achievable DoF are the same between the dual networks
[3], [8], we only consider the SIMO case. Following the same
intuition from the former example, consider an n symbol extension of the original channel and each transmitter possesses
an n-dimensional signal space while every receive space has
nR dimension. With CJ alignment scheme, all signals intended
for receiver i, can be aligned into a subspace whose dimension
is vR at any receiver other than i, where v is the number
of dimensions used by each transmitter inside the total n
dimensional signal space. Consider the aligned interference
at receiver 1, it consists of N − 1 signals which are desired
at receiver 2, 3, . . . N , respectively. Then the DoF obtained at
M
receiver 1 equal M v+(Nv
−1)vR for M independent messages.
By symmetry, the total DoF for all the M N messages in the
M
network are M +(NN
−1)R , as expected. Due to space limitation,
detailed mathematical proof as well as the proof for the
independence between desired signals and interference are
relegated to the full paper [12].
We now proceed to the second part, i.e, scale the number
of antennas at each node by A times and prove the DoF
also scale A times. When M ≤ R, the achievable scheme
follows directly as before, i.e., the DoF multiply by A. When

V. P ROOFS : S PATIAL S CALE I NVARIANCE AND
D ECOMPOSABILITY OF MIMO X N ETWORKS
We only need to prove Theorem 2 which includes Theorem
1 as a special case, as stated before.
A. Outer Bound on the DoF of MIMO X networks
The M × N user SIMO X network with a single antenna at
each transmitter and R antennas at each receiver is considered.
The proof for its reciprocal the N × M MISO X network
follows from the same line. Additionally, the outer bound for
the scaling network could be seen easily.
Proof: When M ≤ R, the DoF value for the X network is
bounded by the total number of transmit antennas M , which
is simply the single-user DoF bound.
When M > R: If we allow full cooperation among the
ﬁrst R transmitters, then it is equivalent to the X network
with M − R + 1 transmitters, the ﬁrst transmitter equipped
with R antennas and all the other transmitters equipped with
single antenna each, and N receivers, each equipped with R
antennas. In [3], it is shown that in X network, the number of
DoF achieved by all the messages associated with transmitter
r
m or receiver n is upper bounded by max(At , Bn ), where
m
r
At and Bn stand for the number of antennas at the transmitter
m
m and receiver n, respectively. Since allowing cooperation
among transmitters does not hurt the capacity, the number of
DoF achieved by all the messages associated with the ﬁrst R

4

M > R, we only need to consider the A times SIMO case as
the reciprocity still holds. Suppose we view each transmitter
with A antennas as A different users with single antenna and
one message to transmit to each of the N receivers. In other
words, we do not allow joint processing of signals among A
antennas at each transmitter. Then we obtain an AM × N user
SIMO X network with a single antennas at each transmitter
and AR antennas at each receiver rather than an M × N user
MIMO X network with A antennas at each transmitter and AR
antennas at each receiver. By the result of SIMO X netwrok,
MNR
AM N AR
AM +N AR−AR = A M +N R−R DoF can be achieved, which
is exactly A times of the corresponding SIMO network. Note
that from the view of one-sided decomposability of this A
times multiple SIMO X network, we separate the transmit
antennas which are less than the number of receive antennas
as 1 < R trivially. This is a general rule, i.e., in an asymmetric
MIMO X network, separating the side with less antennas
would result in a higher DoF.

Therefore, after removing the superﬂuous variables, the total
number of variables is

In this work, we investigate the DoF of MIMO X networks.
We establish that the DoF of SIMO and MISO X networks
follow the spatial scale invariance property. In the achievable
scheme, we reveal a one-sided decomposability property for
these X networks. In addition, we further explore the feasibility for linear IA based only on spatial beamforming, and
prove that improper systems are infeasible.

conclusion is obtained for the K user MIMO interference
channel setting, the proof is relegated to the full paper [12].

When counting the variables in (5), we need to remove the

In the symmetric system described in Section IV, according
to (12) and (15), the total number of equations and variables
are
Ne = M 2 N d2 (N − 1)
(16)

In Section IV, it is shown that to achieve linear IA in MIMO
X network, (5) and (6) should be satisﬁed simultaneously. In
our channel model, we assume that general MIMO channels
have no structure, and the precoding and receiving ﬁlters have
full column rank. Therefore, (6) is satisﬁed automatically.
Then due to the duality between the original channel and the
reciprocal channel, in the following proof of Theorem 3, we
only consider condition (5), i.e., U[k]† H[ki] V[ji] = 0, ∀j = k.
Proof: The proof of Theorem 3 consists of two steps. First
we derive the properness conditions for the symmetric DOF
d in MIMO X network, then we prove that in MIMO X
network, improper implies infeasible.
Similar to interference channel [9], we can obtain the total
number of scalar equations in (5) as
