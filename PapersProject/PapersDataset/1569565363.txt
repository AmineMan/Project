throughput within a deadline, as well as minimizing the transmission time for a given session are considered. Ofﬂine energy
harvesting has been extended to multiple access channels [14],
interference channels [9], broadcast channels [13], and battery
imperfections [2].
In terms of online solutions, many works with optimal
ofﬂine policies propose heuristics for the online problem based
on ofﬂine solutions. In [4], an online approach is proposed
using dynamic programming and quantizing time, although
the curse of dimensionality results in an intractable problem.
In [8] the online problem is considered in a discrete-time
setting and while dynamic programing is used, some structural
results on the optimal solution are proved. In [5], the online
problem is also considered in a discrete-time setting where at
each time instant a random amount of energy is harvested.
Two approaches, save-and-transmit, and best-effort-transmit,
are proposed that achieve the capacity of the channel for the
harvesting model, but implicitly require that the battery have
inﬁnite capacity. A similar discrete-time model but for fading
channels is considered in [7], and also requires an inﬁnite
capacity battery. In [12], the continuous-time online problem
is considered to minimize the time taken to deliver a given
amount of information.
In this paper, we consider the online problem in the
continuous-time setting. We assume the transmitter always
has data to send. Our objective is to determine the optimal
transmission power as a function of remaining battery energy
(referred to as transmission power policy) to maximize longterm average throughput. We initially consider batteries with
both ﬁnite and inﬁnite capacity, although in the inﬁnite capacity case, we restrict ourselves to transmission power policies
that do not result in the stored battery energy to diverge to
inﬁnity, i.e., we consider stable policies only. Energy arrival
times and amounts are unknown, though the distributions
are assumed to be a Poisson point process and exponential
distribution respectively. The optimization problem that results
is found to be closely connected to a compound Poisson dam
model [1]. Using results from compound Poisson dams we
establish structural results. First, we establish concavity of the
problem in the stationary distribution of the stored energy in
the battery. This is non-trivial as the transmission power policy
is related in a non-linear manner to the stationary distribution.
Second, for batteries with ﬁnite capacity, using the calculus
of variations, we establish a ﬁrst order non-linear autonomous
ordinary differential equation for the optimal power control
policy. This ODE has two degrees of freedom to be optimized
(one is via its initial condition which must be strictly positive).
The ODE can be solved numerically, and we thus compute
achieved rates for various battery capacities. We conjecture
that the optimal policy is in fact obtained by taking the limit
as the initial condition goes to 0.

Abstract— We consider the problem of optimal transmission
power for a continuous-time energy harvesting system where
energy arrivals occur at random times in random amounts. We
do not assume that the energy arrivals are known non-causally
and consider the online setting. Here, there is a tradeoff between
increasing instantaneous transmission power, which increases
instantaneous transmission rate and can reduce battery overﬂow,
and decreasing transmission power, which increases battery life
and energy efﬁciency.
We formulate the problem as that of maximizing the average
transmission rate or throughput. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the non-linear
relationship between the transmission power (which is a function
of remaining battery energy) and the stationary distribution on
the remaining battery energy. We then show that the resulting
maximization problem is concave in the distribution of the
remaining battery energy. This is non-trivial due to the nonlinear relationship with the transmission power. We then use a
calculus of variations approach to derive necessary conditions on
the optimal transmission power. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that it must
satisfy a ﬁrst order non-linear autonomous ordinary differential
equation (ODE) that has two degree of freedom for optimization
purposes, one of which is the initial condition of the ODE. Solving
the ODE numerically we compute achieved throughputs as a
function of the battery capacity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
While traditional communication system design is concerned with power efﬁciency, it is usually in the context
of reducing average transmitter power. Battery capacity and
lifetime do not explicitly take an active role in the formulation
other than for the broad observation that lesser transmission
power results in a longer battery life. With the advance in
renewable energy sources where the supply of energy is
now no longer constant, but time varying, the interactions
between battery capacity, energy arrivals, transmission power,
and communications throughput must be explicitly considered.
Solar energy, for example, can only harvest energy during
the daytime, and even then, the supply of energy depends on
weather conditions that cannot be reliably predicted.
Motivated by this, there has been an increasing interest to
include the effects of battery charge and energy arrival times
explicitly into communication system models. Among the ﬁrst
to consider energy explicitly in this sense is [11], where total
transmission energy is minimized by reducing transmission
rate subject to certain time constraints, and the optimal ofﬂine
solution is found. More recent work can be found in [4], [5],
[7]–[9], [12]–[16].
In [16] the problem is formulated in the ofﬂine and
continuous-time setting where energy arrival instants and
amounts are known non-causally, and energy is minimized
subject to deadline constraints. In [4] optimal continuoustime policies for the ofﬂine problem when maximizing the

We further assume that p(z) > 0 for z > 0, since if not, then
the battery always has a reserve of energy that can never be
consumed. Following [1] we also assume sup0<z<L p(z) < ∞
∀L > 0.
This storage model is known as a compound Poisson dam,
for which it is known that the process is either positive recurrent, null recurrent, or transient in the sense that P [Z(t) →
∞] = 1 [1]. As the transient case is a poor model for battery
storage, we restrict ourselves to the recurrent case.
For the positive recurrent case, it is known that there is
always a stationary measure with the following properties [1]:
Theorem 2: The process Z(t) is positive recurrent iff there
is a probability measure π that is absolutely continuous on
(0, ∞) and which may have an atom π0 = π(0), i.e.,

Numerical result show that for a battery capacity large
enough to absorb a few (say 5) average energy arrivals, the
achieved rate is at least 88% compared to a transmitter whose
transmission power is constant and equal to the average rate
of energy harvesting, i.e., the cost of ﬁnite battery capacity is
at most 12% in this case.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section II, the
notation and storage model are provided. In Section III we
provide the problem formulation, and show that it is in fact
concave. In Section IV, we derive an ODE for the optimal
transmission policy, and in Section V, consider numerical
solutions. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.
II. N OTATION AND BACKGROUND
We assume that there is a non-negative rate function r(p) ≥
0 deﬁned for p ≥ 0 and with r(0) = 0 that describes the
instantaneous rate in bits/sec as a function of the instantaneous transmission power p. Furthermore, the rate function is
assumed to satisfy the following properties:
[R1] r(p) is three times continuously differentiable,
[R2] r(p) is non-decreasing in p, i.e., r (p) ≥ 0,
[R3] r(p) is concave, i.e., r (p) ≤ 0.
For example, the Shannon rate function r(p) = log(1 + p/σ 2 )
for any σ 2 > 0 satisﬁes these constraints. In addition, the
choice r(p) = βpγ for any β > 0 and 0 < γ ≤ 1 satisﬁes
these constraints (γ = 1/3 has been found to be a good
approximation for practically realizable rates according to [3]).
Given such a rate function r(p), we also have the following
properties:
Lemma 1: A rate function that satisﬁes properties [R1] –
[R3] also satisﬁes
[R4] r(p) ≥ p × r (p),
[R5] for u > 0 and any ﬁxed constant k > 0, u × r(k/u)
is concave in u.
Proof: [R4] follows since it is clearly true for p = 0,
d
and for p > 0 we have r (p) ≥ r (p) + pr (p) = dp (pr (p)).
d2
[R5] follows since du2 (u × r(k/u)) = r (k/u) × k 2 /u3 ≤ 0.

Since p(z) < ∞ then clearly the density component f (z)
of π satisﬁes f (z) > 0 for all z > 0, and, given π, from (5)
one can always then solve for p(z); z > 0. Furthermore, if
f (z) is continuous on (0, ∞), then so is p(z).
In the case of a battery with ﬁnite storage capacity L, i.e.,
Z(t) ∈ [0, L] for some L > 0, if the arrival of an energy
packet that replenishes the battery exceeds the capacity of the
battery, then the excess energy is lost, i.e., the battery is ﬁlled
to its capacity L. For such a case, it is known (see [1]) that i)
the process Z(t) is always positive recurrent, ii) the stationary
distribution π again may have an atom of measure π0 at 0
and iii) π is absolutely continuous on (0, L) with density f
satisfying (4) and thus (5). (Note that since p(L) > 0, there
is no probability mass at z = L.)
In the sequel, L = ∞ in the inﬁnite battery capacity case
and L < ∞ in the ﬁnite battery case.
III. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
Given parameter δ > 0 that characterizes the arrival times of
the energy packets, and parameter λ characterizing the distribution B(.) of the size of the energy packets, we would like
to determine good power transmission policies. Speciﬁcally,
transmitting at power p(z) results in an instantaneous rate
of r(p(z)). In this paper we wish to optimize the long term
average rate, i.e., we wish to maximize

and the amount of energy in the battery at time t is given by

Furthermore, π is the unique stationary distribution of Z.
In this paper, we are only concerned with the positive
recurrent case as the others do not have physical signiﬁcance.
Furthermore, we will consider the case that the energy
arrivals Ui follow an exponential distribution with mean 1/λ,
i.e., B(x) = 1 − exp(−λx). In this case, (4) reduces to

N (t)

that satisﬁes

We now describe the storage model, proceeding ﬁrst with
the inﬁnite battery case. We consider a battery which at time
t has Z(t) units of energy stored. Energy is consumed for
transmission at a rate p(z) < ∞ with p(0) = 0, i.e., the
transmission power is a function of the current state of the
battery, and the transmission power is 0 when the battery is
drained.
Energy is replenished into the battery according to energy
arrivals U1 , U2 , . . ., which occur at random times T1 < T2 <
. . .. The energy arrivals Ui are assumed i.i.d. with P [U ≤ x] =
B(x), and the number of energy arrivals up to time t, N (t),
is assumed to be a homogeneous Poisson process of intensity
δ. Then the total energy harvested until time t is

Z(t) is positive recurrent, we have that

and thus, it is not clear if the objective function is concave.
We show next that this is indeed the case.

where in (a) we have used a variation of the log-sum

αG1 (z) exp(−λz) and b2 = (1 − α)G2 (z) exp(−λz).
Since the change of variables (12) is a linear mapping
between f (z) and g(z), we also conclude that the original
problem given by (8)–(11) is also concave in (f (z), π0 ).

solved explicitly in terms of g(z). In the case that L = ∞,
and thus no harvested energy is lost to battery overﬂow, from
(12), (13), and integrating by parts

IV. S TRUCTURE OF O PTIMAL p(z)
Assume now L < ∞. A necessary condition for a transmission power policy to be a global optimal solution is to be a
local optimal solution. Speciﬁcally, if (g(z), π0 ) with π0 > 0
and corresponding p(z) is a local maximum, then consider any
h(z) continuous on [0, L] such that

In the following, we will ﬁrst show that i) the problem is
concave over a convex set, and ii) determine the structure of
optimal p(z) using the calculus of variations.
The problem given by (8)–(11) is non-trivial in part as the
relation between f (z) and p(z) given by (9) is non-linear.
Nevertheless, we will show that the optimization is concave.
First, consider the change of variable

to g (z) according to (13). Expanding terms to ﬁrst order in

Now, let (g
and (g
be two choices of
g(z) and π0 that satisfy the constraints (16) – (17) with
corresponding transmission power p1 (z) and p2 (z) according to (13). Then clearly, the convex combination g α (z) =
α

2
αg 1 (z)+(1−α)g 2 (z) and π0 = απ0 +(1−α)π0 for 0 ≤ α ≤ 1
satisﬁes (16) – (17) as well, and thus the optimization is over a
convex set. However, it is not necessary that the corresponding
transmission power policy pα (z) = αp1 (z) + (1 − α)p2 (z),

We claim the right hand side is non-negative. This is because
i) r (p) ≥ 0 for p ≥ 0, ii) r(p) − r (p)p ≥ 0 for p ≥ 0 by
[R4], and iii) r (p) ≤ 0 for p > 0 as r is concave in p.
Remark: One physical interpretation of K is that it can be
used to control p (z)|z=0+ via (34), although the “cost” is to
change the ODE itself (see (33)).
While the above differential equation has no apparent analytical solution in terms of r(p), we now consider a numerical
solution.

From (13) and since g (z) has the same mass π0 as g(z),
p (z) = δ

where H(z) =

V. N UMERICAL S OLUTION
The solution of (33) does not appear to have a closed form.
However, for a speciﬁed K and initial condition p(z)|z=0+ :=
p0 , it can be solved to arbitrary precision using standard
numerical ODE solvers. From (13) we have that

Therefore, the term inside the square brackets of (30) must be
some multiple of exp(−λz), say −K exp(−λz), (K may be
a function of the constants δ, λ and L) and hence
δr (p(z)) + λr(p(z))
+ r (p(z))p(z)p (z) − λr (p(z))p(z) + K = 0, (33)
which is a ﬁrst order non-linear autonomous ODE for p(z).
Although it is difﬁcult to say anything structurally about the
solution without making further assumptions, the following
result can be shown
Lemma 4: Any solution p(z) of the differential equation
(33) for K ≥ 0 is non-decreasing in z for p(z) ≥ 0.
Proof: Solving for p (z) we have
p (z) =

Thus, while there is no closed form solution to the ODE, for
a given initial p0 and parameter K, we can determine both
the power transmission policy p(z) as well as the stationary
measure π, and thus the average transmission rate (7).
We now consider the Shannon rate function r(p) = log(1 +
p/σ 2 ) and the case δ = λ = 1, and noise power σ 2 = 1,
i.e., energy arrives at an average rate of 1 unit of energy per
unit of time. A communication system that transmitted with
a constant power that is precisely this average power would
obtain a rate of log(1 + 1/1) = 1. For an inﬁnite capacity
battery, any rate (1/(1 + )) log(2 + ) can be achieved by a
stable policy that transmits with power (1 + ) whenever the
battery is not depleted, i.e., for a fraction 1/(1+ ) of the time.
Thus any rate strictly less than 1 can be achieved, but at the
cost that P [Z(t) > M ] > 0 for all M then.
For a system with a ﬁnite battery, this rate cannot be
achieved. (The ofﬂine problem with ﬁnite battery has been
considered in [10] and a case with no battery in [6].) Table I
shows the rate from (7) obtained by numerically solving the
ODE for various p0 with K = 0 and K = −0.6 respectively
(the later choice was found to provide good performance).

continuous part f (z) of the stationary distribution π for L = 4
with K = −0.6. From the table, it is observed that the
throughput R achieves at least 88% of that of the inﬁnite
battery case when L is only 5, i.e., the penalty is at most
12% in this case. Also, while the achieved throughput appears
as it might be non-decreasing with decreasing p0 (with L = 1
and K = −0.6 a clear exception), it is conjectured that if K
is optimized for each choice of p0 and L then throughput is
increasing with increasing L and increasing with decreasing
p0 .
VI. C ONCLUSION
We have considered the problem of optimal power transmission policy for online energy harvesting with energy arrivals that occur at random times and in random amounts. A
structural result on the concavity of the problem was shown,
and a differential equation was derived that any local optimal
solution must satisfy. Future work includes considering different energy arrival distributions as well as determining the
optimal values of the parameters of the differential equation
and therefore, the optimal long term average rate that can be
achieved by energy harvesting as a function of the battery
capacity L.
