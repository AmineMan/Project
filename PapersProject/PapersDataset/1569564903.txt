was combined with interference cancellation to mitigate the
cross-tier interference in heterogeneous networks. In contrast,
our proposed scheme takes into account the random spatial
model of FAPs as well as the dense deployment of femtocell
networks. By applying stochastic geometry, we evaluate the
performance of our proposed scheme in terms of distribution
of received signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we present
our system model. In Section III, we describe our proposed
interference alignment scheme. In Section IV, the performance
analysis of our proposed interference coordination scheme is
provided. Some numerical results are provided in Section VI.
Finally, conclusion is given in Section VII. Throughout the
paper, we shall use the following notation. Boldface uppercase letters denote matrices, boldface lower-case letters denote
column vectors, and plain lower-case letters denote scalars.
The superscripts (·)T , (·)∗ , and (·)† denote the transpose,
complex conjugate, and transpose conjugate, respectively. We
denote | · | as the absolute value, and · as the standard
Euclidean norm.

Abstract—In this paper, we consider a two-tier MIMO network
in the downlink, consisting of a single macrocell base station
with multiple transmit antennas coexisting with several closedaccess MIMO femtocells. With multiple receive antennas at both
the macrocell and femtocell users, we propose an opportunistic
interference alignment scheme to design the transmit and receive
beamformers in order to mitigate intra and inter-tier interference. Moreover, to reduce the number of macrocell and femtocell
users coexisting in the same spectrum, we apply a random
spectrum allocation on top of the opportunistic interference alignment scheme. By applying stochastic geometry, we evaluate the
performance of our proposed scheme in terms of distribution of
received signal-to-interference plus noise ratio. Numerical results
show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in improving the
performance of random MIMO femtocell networks.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A femtocell is a low power, intended for short range, home
base station, able to extend the cellular network coverage and
provide high speed data service inside homes and enterprises
to indoor users with superior reception [1]–[4]. Such small cell
networks are attractive to wireless operator since femtocells
are deployed at the user premises and they leverage on the
user’s existing broadband internet connection as backhaul. In
this way, there is no additional deployment cost, energy supply
cost or site rental incurred on the operator.
Recently, the concept of interference alignment (IA) was
introduced as a linear beamforming technique to align beamforming matrices at the transmitters such that the interference
at each receiver is aligned in an interference subspace, leaving
the desired signal to transmit in an interference-free subspace
[5]. At the receivers, we can apply a simple zero-forcing
receiving vector to project the desired signal onto the interference free subspace which is sufﬁcient for signal detection.
There is great interest in employing this concept of IA in
different type of interference networks [6]–[9].
In this paper, we consider a two-tier MIMO network in
the downlink, consisting of a single macrocell base station
(MBS) with multiple transmit antennas coexisting with several
closed-access MIMO FAPs. With multiple receive antennas
at both the macrocell and femtocell users, we propose an
opportunistic IA scheme to design the transmit and receive
beamformers in order to mitigate intra and inter-tier interference. Moreover, to reduce the number of macrocell and
femtocell users coexisting in the same spectrum, we apply
a random spectrum allocation on top of the opportunistic
IA scheme. Closely related to our work is [9], where IA

Consider a two-tier network with a central MBS of Mc
antennas serving a circular region C of radius Rc . The macrocell is underlaid with a random number of FAPs equipped with
Mft antennas. The FAPs are spatially distributed according to
a homogeneous poisson point process (PPP) ¨f with intensity
λf . Therefore, the average number of FAPs within the cellular
coverage is given by Nf = λf |C|. For each FAP, we consider
a circular cell coverage of radius Rf , where Uf femtocell users
(FUEs) are uniformly distributed on the circumference of each
cell, such that Rf
Rc .
Assume that the available spectrum is split into B subchannels, each with bandwidth W Hz and the MBS uses
all these subchannels to serve Nc MUEs in the macrocell
tier. Furthermore, we divide the Nc MUEs into macrocell
user groups, such that each user group consists of nc MUEs
sharing b subchannels. We denote M as a group of MUEs
that contains nc MUEs. To avoid interference among each
macrocell user group, we assume that the b subchannels
allocated to each group are mutually orthogonal. Therefore,
by employing multiuser MIMO, the MBS can serve all the nc
MUEs simultaneously within each macrocell user group for a
given set of b subchannels. At the femtocell tier, we consider
that the FAPs apply F-ALOHA spectrum access strategy,

1

in femtocell ith and MUE jth within group M, respectively,
such that E {si s∗ } = Pf and E xj x∗ = Pc . In addition,
j
i
r
nf and nc are the Mfr × 1 and Mc × 1 AWGN noise vectors
with zero mean and variance N0 , respectively. Let the received
beamforming vectors of the ith FUE and the ith MUE be
r
r
wi ∈ C1×Mf and ui ∈ C1×Mc , the received signals after
applying the above receive beamforming vectors in (1) and
(2) become

where each FAP exactly access one group of b subchannels
among B with independently and equal probability. Therefore,
the F-ALOHA thins the mean number of FAPs in each
b
subchannels by the spectrum access probability p = B . Within
each FAP, we employ TDMA as the multiple access scheme
to serve one FUE at each time slot for a chosen set of b
subchannels, and the average number of active users within
the cellular coverage becomes N = Nc +pNf . In other words,
for a given time slot and a given group of b subchannels, there
will be nc MUEs coexisting with a random number of FUEs,
which are spatially distributed according to a PPP ψf with
intensity λf = pλf . When p = 1, the MBS will use the whole
spectrum to serve all the Nc MUEs simultaneously and all
the FAPs can also access the entire spectrum. On the other
hand, when p = 1/Nc , the MBS only serves one MUE and
this MUE is only interfered by the cross-tier interference from
femtocells.
For both tiers, the downlink channel is characterized by a
combination of path loss and Rayleigh fading. The path loss
function at a ﬁxed distance R is g(x) = R−α , where α is
the path loss exponent. In the following, we denote αo , αi ,
and αio as the path loss exponent of the outdoor link, the
indoor link, and the cross link between indoor and outdoor,
r
t
respectively. For macrocell tier, we denote q fi ∈ CMf ×Mc and
r
t
q fi ∈ CMc ×Mc as the random channel matrices from the MBS
to the FUE of the ith FAP and to the ith MUE, respectively,
where each entry of the above matrices is distributed as
r
t
CN (0, 1)1 . For the femtocell tier, we denote r ij ∈ CMf ×Mf
r
t
and u ij ∈ CMc ×Mf as the random channel matrices from
the jth FAP to the FUE in the ith FAP and the ith MUE,
respectively, where each entry of the above matrices is also
distributed as CN (0, 1).
Each FAP (or MBS) transmits signal to its users by applying
a transmit beamforming vector. By denoting the transmit
beamforming vector from the ith FAP to its own FUE as
t
vi ∈ CMf ×1 and the transmit beamforming vector from the
t
MBS to the jth MUE as fj ∈ CMc ×1 , the received signals
at the 0th FUE and the 0th MUE within group M can be,
respectively, expressed as

Note that according to Slivnyak’s Theorem, the statistics of
interference observed by any node in the network is the same
if the nodes form a homogeneous PPP [10]. Therefore, it
allows us to consider a typical receiver for each tier in the
following, which is represented as the 0th FUE and 0th MUE,
respectively.
III. O PPORTUNISTIC I NTERFERENCE A LIGNMENT
Due to the large number of FAPs and their random deployment, it is challenging to suppress all the interference from the
FAPs. Instead, our opportunistic IA scheme only cancels the
nearest interferer. Speciﬁcally, the description of our proposed
scheme is given as follows:
Step 1: For a given set of subchannels, each MUE from the
set of nc MUEs ﬁrst identiﬁes Nic nearest interfering
FAPs in order to design its zero-forcing receive vector ui such that it is orthogonal to all these interfering
links. This is possible only if |Nic | ≤ M r − 1, where
|Nic | is the number of identiﬁed nearest interfering
FAPs. When this condition is satisﬁed, the receive
beamforming vector at MUE i is given by



Step 2: Next, we design the transmit beamforming vectors
at the MBS such that the nc MUEs are mutually
orthogonal to each other. Since the receive beamforming vectors of the nc MUEs have already been
determined in Step 1, we should take this into
account in the design of our transmit beamforming
vectors in this step as follows:

concept of IA. Speciﬁcally, we ensure that the transmit beamforming vector is chosen such that the
intra-tier interference from each FAP to its nearest
victim FUE is aligned with the cross-tier interference
from the MBS to this victim FUE. Mathematically,
the transmit beamforming vector at FAP j needs to
satisfy the following condition:
(7)

k∈M

such that Mfr ≤ Mft and i is the user index of the
nearest victim FUE.
Step 4: Lastly, we simply need to design the receive beamforming vector at each FAP. Since the intra-tier and
cross-tier interference has been aligned in Step 3, we
can simply design the receive beamforming vector at
each FUE to be orthogonal to the aligned interference
subspace as follows:

scheme may not be feasible. Beside the conditions |Nic | ≤

The interfering FAP that spans the same subspace with the

nearest neighbor to FUE 0. The event A is deﬁned when this
FAP is the nearest neighbor that causes interference to FUE

both interference from MBS and nearest FAP 1. From Fig.

(20)

In this section, we show the numerical results based on
our analysis and our proposed OIA scheme in terms of
different performance metrics, namely: success probability,
spatial average capacity, total network throughput, and energy
efﬁciency. In the following, at the transmitting side, we assume
4 antennas for the MBS and 2 antennas for FAP; while, at
the receiving side, we assume 2 antennas for FUE and MUE.
We consider that MBS is placed at the center of C, where we
2
ﬁxed the area |C| = πRc . In addition, the MUEs are uniformly
placed on the edge of a smaller circle centered around MBS
with radius d.
In Fig. 2, we compare the SINR distribution of the FUE before and after applying the OIA scheme for λf = 1.59 × 10−5 .
From Fig. 2 we can see the effectiveness of the proposed
OIA scheme and our analytical results match very well with
the simulation results. By removing cross-tier interference and
one nearest neighboring intra-tier interference, the SINR curve
is shifted to the right, showing that a higher SINR can be

achieved by employing OIA scheme. However, with only OIA
scheme alone, the network performance cannot be improved
signiﬁcantly (p = 1). The combination of random spectrum
allocation (p = 0.2) together with OIA scheme increase the
received SINR signiﬁcantly, as seen by the shifting of the
curves to the right when both OIA scheme and spectrum
allocation are applied.
In Fig. 3, the distributions of SINR for FUE after applying
the OIA scheme are plotted for both sparse and dense deployment of FAPs. The results are shown for the cases with
p = 1 and p = 0.2, which captures the effect of random
allocation. From the ﬁgure, we see that our analysis match
the simulation results very well for both FUE and MUE,
regardless of the density of FAP. The performance gap between
random and no random spectrum allocation becomes larger
when the intensity of FAP increases. Thus, this further shows
the importance of spectrum allocation in reducing intra- and
inter-tier interference on top of the OIA scheme.

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we considered a two-tier MIMO network in
the downlink, consisting of a single macrocell base station
with multiple transmit antennas coexisting with several closedaccess MIMO femtocells. With multiple receive antennas at
both the macrocell and femtocell users, we proposed an OIA
scheme to design the transmit and receive beamformers in
order to mitigate intra and inter-tier interference. Moreover, to
reduce the number of macrocell and femtocell users coexisting
in the same spectrum, we apply a random spectrum allocation
on top of the OIA scheme. By applying stochastic geometry,
we evaluated the performance of our proposed scheme in terms
of CDF of SINR and network throughput.
