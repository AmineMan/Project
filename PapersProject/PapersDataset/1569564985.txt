Abstract—In 1980 Alltop produced a family of
cubic phase sequences that nearly meet the Welch
bound for maximum non-peak correlation magnitude. This family of sequences were shown by Wooters and Fields to be useful for quantum state tomography. Alltop’s construction used a function that is
not planar, but whose difference function is planar. In
this paper we show that Alltop type functions cannot
exist in ﬁelds of characteristic 3 and that for a known
class of planar functions, x3 is the only Alltop type
function.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Planar functions belong to the larger class of
highly nonlinear functions which are of use in
classical cryptographic systems, coding theory as
well as being of theoretical interest [4].
Let Fpr be a ﬁeld of characteristic p. A function
f : Fpr → Fpr is called a planar function if for
every a ∈ F∗r the function ∆f a : x → f (a + x) −
p
f (x) is a bijection.
An equivalent deﬁnition of a planar function
involves the ability to construct an afﬁne plane [6,
§5], which is where the name planar originates. It
is known that planar functions do not exist on ﬁelds
of characteristic 2 [6, §5].
Two orthonormal bases B1 and B2 of Cd are
1
unbiased if | x|y | = √d for all x ∈ B1 and
y ∈ B2 . A set of bases for Cd which are pairwise unbiased is a set of mutually unbiased bases
(MUBs). This idea is credited to Schwinger [14]
who realised that a quantum system prepared in a
basis state from B reveals no information when
measured with respect to the basis B. Mutually
unbiased bases (MUBs) are an important tool in
quantum information theory and have applications
in quantum cryptography [2], [13] and quantum
state tomography [16].
We highlight two different constructions of mutually unbiased bases for odd prime power integers,

one which uses a polynomial of degree 3 but only
works for ﬁnite ﬁelds of characteristic p ≥ 5 [9,
Theorem 1]. This construction is a generalisation of
low correlation complex sequences ﬁrst constructed
by Alltop [1] for spread spectrum radar and communication applications.
The other construction uses a polynomial of
degree 2, which is a planar function, to construct
the vectors in a complete set of MUBs (see Thm
1) [12], [9]. In contrast, the Alltop construction of
complete sets of MUBs (Thm 2 [1], [9]) uses a
function, f (x) = x3 which is not planar, but for
which the difference function ∆f a (x) is planar.
We aim to discover if x3 is the only polynomial
function with this property.

II. P RELIMINARIES
We begin with some preliminary results concerning polynomials. The following properties of
binomial expansions will be used in calculating
∆f a (x).
Lemma 6. [15, Prop. 8] Let n = ai pi and k =
n
bi pi with 0 ≤ ai , bi ≤ p. Then p
k if and
only if 0 ≤ bi ≤ ai for all i.
Lemma 7. [15, Cor 19.1] If ps |n and (k, p) = 1,
then ps | n .
k
Lemma 8. [15, Cor 10.2]

we notice a polynomial of degree 2. Now Π(x) =
x2 is a planar function, and equation (2) ensures
that a set of MUBs has been constructed. Thus
if we take f (x) = (x + b)3 then ∆f d (x) is a
planar function. The question that arises is whether
f (x) = (x + b)3 is the only function of this type:

ps
k

(6)
Corollary 9.
ps + 1
k

Question 3. Is f (x) = x the only polynomial
function on a Galois ﬁeld such that ∆f a (x) is a
planar function?
Two sets of MUBs, B = {B0 , B1 , . . . , Bd } and
C = {C0 , C1 , . . . , Cd }, written as matrices, are
equivalent [3, App A] if either B or B ∗ is equal to
{U C0 D0 P0 , U C1 D1 P1 , . . . , U Cd Dd Pd } for some
unitary matrix, U , unitary diagonal matrices, Di ,
and permutation matrices, Pi .
Godsil and Roy [8] have shown that the Alltop
construction produces MUBs that are equivalent to
the set of MUBs constructed using Π(x) = x2 in
the Planar function construction, which naturally
leads to the following question:
Question 4. If another function exists such that
∆f a (x) is planar, will the sets of MUBs constructed be equivalent?
Any function which meets the criteria of Question 3 will hence forth be called an Alltop type
function.
Deﬁnition 5. An Alltop type polynomial is a
polynomial, f , such that for each a ∈ F∗
q
∆f a (x) = Πa (x)

(5)

for some planar polynomial Πa .
We investigate Question 3 establishing that Alltop type functions cannot exist on ﬁelds of characteristic 3, and show that for the class of planar
k
functions of the form Π(x) = xp +1 with p a
3
prime, f (x) = x is the only Alltop type function.

Using these preliminary facts, we can calculate
a few properties of ∆f a (x) when f is a monomial.
Lemma 11. Let Fq be a ﬁeld of characteristic p
and f (x) = xn with n = ps , where s ≥ 0. Then
∆f a (x) is constant for all a ∈ F∗ .
q
Proof: By the Taylor’s expansion ∆f a (x) =
ai xn−i . By Lemma 8 p| n for all k ∈
k
{1, . . . , ps − 1} hence (x + a)n − xn is constant.

Theorem 12. Let Fq be a ﬁeld of characteristic p
and f (x) = xn with n = ps m where s ≥ 0, m > 1
and (m, p) = 1. Then ∆f a (x) has degree ps (m−1)
for all a ∈ F∗ .
q
Proof: Let f (x) = xn then by the Taylor’s
n
n i n−i
expansion ∆f a (x) =
. We need
i=1 i a x
to show that the ﬁrst non-zero coefﬁcient in this
n
binomial expansion is ps .
We start with s = 0. Then n and p are co-prime
n
and ps = n = n which is not divisible by p.
1
Next consider s > 0 and recall m > 1.
If s = 1, then n = pm and, by Lemma 7, p| n
i
for 1 ≤ i ≤ p−1 but p n which is the coefﬁcient
p
of xn−p = xp(m−1) and hence ∆f a (x) has degree
p(m − 1).

2

For s > 1, it is clear from Lemma 7 that p| n
i
for all i such that (p, i) = 1. The question that
remains is whether p| n for those i < ps with i, p
i
not co-prime.
Let i = pk t for 1 ≤ k < s and (p, t) = 1, t ≥ 1.
By Lemmas 7 and 10,

Since m and ps are co-prime, m = i=0 ai pi

where a0 ≥ 1. Hence n = ps m = i=s ai−s pi ,

whereas p = 1.p + i=s 0 × p . Using Lemma

6 we ﬁnd that p

p (m − 1).
Corollary 13. Let a ∈ F∗r . If ∆f a (x) ∈ Fpr [x]
p
has degree ps l, where (l, p) = 1 and 0 ≤ s ≤ r,
then

polynomial of degree less than q which induces the
same function on Fq [5]. Hence we only consider
polynomials of degree less that q.
With the aid of the preceding facts about polynomial expansions, we show that no Alltop type
functions exist in ﬁelds of characteristic 3, and that
a speciﬁc class of planar functions has a unique
Alltop type function.
A more recent and extensive list of planar function can be found in [11]. New planar functions are
continually being discovered. The results presented
here are not an exhaustive investigation, but show
some promising directions for future work.
III. S PECIFIC CLASSES OF PLANAR FUNCTIONS
It is known that planar functions do not exist
in ﬁeld of characteristic 2 [6]. We show that
Alltop type functions cannot exist in a ﬁeld of
characteristic 3.
Theorem 15. There are no Alltop type polynomials
over F3r .

f (x) = g(x) +

t

Proof:

(ps−t l+1)

∆f a (x) =f (x + a) − f (x)

t=0

where at least one of bt ∈ F∗r , and g(x) is such
p
that ∆ga (x) is of degree less than ps l.
t

Proof: From Theorem 12, if f has degree p m
then ∆f a (x) has degree pt (m − 1).
pt (m − 1) =ps l

+ f (x).

Lemma 14. [5] Let L(x) and L (x) be additive
permutation polynomials, and M (x) an additive
polynomial on a ﬁeld F of characteristic p. Let
Π (x) = L (Π(L(x)))+M (x)+δ. If Π is a planar
function on a ﬁeld F, then Π is also a planar
function on F for all δ ∈ F.
The functions Π and Π are considered equivalent [4]. For a ﬁeld of characteristic p, an additive
polynomial has the shape
k
i

ai xp .

(14)

i=0

The families of planar functions are speciﬁed
by conditions on the degree of the monomials
which make up Π. Hence we are only considering
L(x), L (x) to have degree 1. Any polynomial on
Fq may be reduced modulo xq − x to yield a

(16)

In a ﬁeld of characteristic 3, −1 ≡ 2, hence
∆∆f ab (x) =f (x + a + b) + 2f (x + b)
+ 2f (x + a) + f (x).

(13)

Thus the possible monomials f for which ∆f a (x)
has degree ps l are of degree pt (ps−t l + 1) where
0 ≤ t ≤ s.

M (x) =

∆∆f ab (x) =f (x + a + b) − f (x + b) − f (x + a)

(12)

m =ps−t l + 1.

(15)

(17)

Let a = b = 1 then
∆∆f 11 (x) =f (x + 2) + 2f (x + 1) + 2f (x + 1)
+ f (x)

(18)

=f (x + 2) + f (x + 1) + f (x). (19)
Now let x = 1, 0
∆∆f 11 (0) =f (2) + f (1) + f (0),
∆∆f 11 (1) =f (0) + f (2) + f (1),
=∆∆f 11 (0).

(20)
(21)
(22)

Hence ∆∆f 11 (x) is not a permutation polynomial,
∆f 1 (x) is not a planar function, and f is not an
Alltop type polynomial.
This is of particular importance since while new
planar functions are continually being discovered,
half of the known classes of planar functions exist
only on ﬁelds of characteristic 3 [11]. On the
other hand, the relative known abundance of planar
functions on ﬁelds of characteristic 3, may be more
a product of the ease of search, than the rarity of
planar functions on ﬁelds of higher characteristic.

Theorem 16. [7] Let Π1 (x) = xp +1 on Fpr ,
where p is an odd prime, k ≥ 0 is an integer and
r
gcd(r,k) is an odd integer. Then Π1 (x) is a planar
function.
This includes x2 is a special case. We now show
that a cubic is the only Alltop type polynomial for
this class of planar functions, conditional that p =
5.

If for each a ∈ Fpr there exist αa , βa , δa ∈ Fpr ,
an additive polynomial Ma (x) and a polynomial
fa (x) such that,

s = 0 and m = 3, which implies p ≥ 5 as already
shown. This is the Alltop function.

∆fa a (x) = αa Π1 (x + βa ) + Ma (x) + δa (23)
then p ≥ 5 and fa (x) is equivalent to a polynomial
of degree 3.
Proof: Theorem 15 shows that p ≥ 5. The
proof proceeds by establishing a set of possible
degrees for f , and eliminating all possibilities other
than 3. For ease of notation let αa = α, βa = β,
δa = δ, Ma (x) = M (x), and fa (x) = f (x).
It is assumed that ∆f a (x) = αΠ1 (x + β) +
M (x) + δ. Since αΠ1 (x + β) + M (x) + δ has
a term of degree pk + 1, and hence by Corollary
13 f has a term of degree pk + 2.
Consider a general polynomial function f (x) of
n
degree n; f (x) takes the form f (x) = i=0 ai xi ,
with ai ∈ Fpr . That is, f can be written as the
sum of monomials fi (x) = ai xi of degree i or

There exits an additive polynomial M in equation

Note that equation (25) has no x2 term but
equation (29) does. Hence the coefﬁcient of the x2
term in ∆ha (x) must be nonzero, and must cancel
with the x2 term already present in equation (29).
However, we note that all the higher order terms
are in agreement, hence all such terms in ∆ha (x)
must have zero coefﬁcients implying ∆ha (x) has

IV. C ONCLUSION
We have shown that for a speciﬁc family of
Planar functions, a cubic is the only Alltop type
polynomial. We have also shown that Alltop type
functions cannot exist on ﬁelds of characteristic
3, which means that Alltop type functions cannot
exist for many classes of planar functions.
New planar polynomials are continually being
discovered. Thus investigating the existence of
Alltop type polynomials for all classes of planar
function cannot yet be completed. However many
of the newly discovered planar functions are on
ﬁelds of characteristic 3. So perhaps the possible
solution space is not expanding so rapidly.
