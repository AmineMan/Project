parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> We propose a scheme for Compressed Sensing in the noiseless setting that reconstructs the original signal operating on a binary graph where the samples are obtained sequentially. The proposed scheme has an affordable computational complexity and a large performance enhancement with respect to similar schemes in the literature, thanks to the proposed measurement matrix structure and enhanced decoding based on a message passing algorithm.
