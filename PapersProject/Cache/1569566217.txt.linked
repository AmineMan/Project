xmlabstract -> In this paper we investigate repeated root cyclic and negacyclic codes of length p^rm over F_p^s with (m,p)=1. In the case p odd, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of negacyclic self-dual codes. In the special case when m=2m' with m' odd, we characterize the codes in terms of their generator polynomials. This provides simple conditions on the existence of self-dual negacyclic codes. It also generalizes the results of Dinh. We also answer an open problem concerning the number of self-dual cyclic codes given by Jia et al.
