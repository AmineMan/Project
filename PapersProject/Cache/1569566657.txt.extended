xmlabstract -> Recently sparse superposition codes have been developed which are fast and reliable at any rate below the channel capacity for the additive white Gaussian noise channel with power control. We substantially improve on the performance using soft decision decoders with Bayes optimal statistics at each iteration of the decoder, followed by thresholding only at the final step. This presentation includes formulation of the statistics and their distributions, numerical simulations of the performance improvement, and some useful identities in the analysis. These identities relate a squared error risk to a posterior probability of error and provide unbiased estimation of this risk.
