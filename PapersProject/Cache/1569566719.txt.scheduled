xmlabstract -> We consider a novel group testing procedure, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome sequence processing. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a combination of an adder model followed by a quantizer. For the new testing scheme we define the capacity, and evaluate some special cases using information theoretic methods. We also define a new class of disjunct codes suitable for SQGT dubbed SQ-disjunct. Based on this new family of codes, we provide both explicit and probabilistic code constructions for SQGT with simple decoding algorithms.
