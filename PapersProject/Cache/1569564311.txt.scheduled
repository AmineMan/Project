parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> In this paper, we present an analysis on the performance of Plotkin-type UEP codes by using threshold and equivalent channel model under the Gaussian assumption. Specifically,we give a framework on how to assign the rate of each component code of this Plotkin-type UEP code so that the goal of UEP is successfully achieved with far better overall BER performance. The result is surprising in that which component code should be assigned for MSB can be changed according to the assigned rate of each component code and overall rate.
