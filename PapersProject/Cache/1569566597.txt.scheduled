xmlabstract -> In this paper, we investigate how constraints on the randomization in the encoding process affect the secrecy rates achievable over wiretap channels. In particular, we characterize the secrecy capacity with a rate-limited local source of randomness and a less capable eavesdropper's channel, which shows that limited rate incurs a secrecy rate penalty but does not preclude secrecy. We also show that secure communication is possible when randomizing with a non-uniform source of randomness, which suggests the possibility of designing robust coding schemes.
