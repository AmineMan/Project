xmlabstract -> ``THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD". We consider a two-user multiple-access channel, where one of the encoders is allowed to take an action that effects the formation of the channel states. The states are know non-causally to the encoder. Two independent messages are sent: a common message and a private message transmitted by the informed encoder. We find precise characterizations of the capacity region. Our framework takes account of previously evaluated settings regarding point-to-point channels with actions and multiple-access channels with common messages. We obtain the capacity of the Gaussian action-dependent point-to-point channel.
