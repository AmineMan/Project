xmlpapertitle -> Strong Secrecy in Compound Broadcast Channels with Confidential Messages
parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> In this paper the compound broadcast channel with confidential messages is studied, where it is only known to the transmitter and receivers that the actual channel realization is fixed and from a pre-specified set of channels. An achievable rate region for the strong secrecy criterion is derived. Further, a multi-letter outer bound is given, which establishes, together with the achievable rate region, a multi-letter expression of the strong secrecy capacity region.
