xmlabstract -> In this paper we derive the sum-capacity of 3-user linear deterministic interference channels (LDIC) under certain connectivity assumptions with symmetric parameters. The results also directly yield the sum-capacity of a 3-user fully-connected LDIC with symmetric parameters. We further illustrate with an example the potential difficulties in extending the results to asymmetric cases.
