xmlpapertitle -> Completely Decoupled Space-Time Block Codes with Low-Rate Feedback
parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> In this paper, we propose a class of full diversity rate one space-time block codes (STBC) satisfying the generalized orthogonal constraint (GOC). First an explicit construction of completely decoupled STBC is proposed to obtain a rate one STBC with linear decoding complexity for any number of transmit antennas. Then we propose an adaptation strategy for the codes to achieve full diversity by utilizing partial phase information of the channel obtained via a feedback link. With a few feedback bits, the proposed rate one code has full diversity while reserving the same decoding complexity as Orthogonal STBCs. Moreover, the full diversity can be still achieved even if the simple zero-forced decoding is used at the receiver.
