xmlabstract -> THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We propose a buffer-aided relaying protocol for a three node relay network comprised of a source, a half-duplex relay with buffer, and a destination. We assume a direct source-destination link is available and all links undergo fading. The proposed protocol enables the half-duplex relay to choose its reception and transmission time slots adaptively and based on the quality of the involved links. We derive the achievable ergodic rate of the considered three-node network for the proposed protocol. Our results show that this achievable ergodic rate exceeds existing unachievable ergodic capacity upper bounds for the three-node half-duplex relay channel with the relay always alternating between reception and transmission.
