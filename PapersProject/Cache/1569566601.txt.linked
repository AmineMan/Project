xmlabstract -> Random linear network coding (RLNC) can improve the reliability of end-to-end communication in the presence of erasure channels. In RLNC with intra-session coding, an intermediate node creates coded packets by combining the packets of various sources destined for a destination. Each transmitted packet contains information of multiple sources. In this paper, we study the decoding delay of RLNC with intra-session coding for a line network with $S$ sources and a destination. Given the generation size $K$, we show that the expected decoding delay is upper-bounded by $\sqrt{\eta_2 K \log(S)} + K\eta_1 + \eta$, where $\eta$, $\eta_1$, $\eta_2$ are constants. The analytical results are validated via simulations. We also compare the results with the case where intra-session coding is not used.
