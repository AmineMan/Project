xmlabstract -> The min-rank of a digraph was shown by Bar-Yossef et al. (2006) to represent the length of an optimal scalar linear solution of the corresponding instance of the Index Coding with Side Information (ICSI) problem. In this work, the graphs and digraphs of near-extreme min-ranks are characterized. Those graphs and digraphs correspond to the ICSI instances having near-extreme transmission rates when using optimal scalar linear index codes. It is also shown that the decision problem whether a digraph has min-rank two is NP-complete. By contrast, the same question for graphs can be answered in polynomial time.
