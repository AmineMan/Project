parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> In this paper we design a decoding algorithm based on a lifting decoding scheme. This leads to a unique decoding algorithm with complexity quasi linear in all the parameters for Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings and a list decoding algorithm. We show that, using erasures in our algorithms, allows one to decode more errors than half the minimum distance with a high probability. Finally we apply these techniques to interleaved linear codes over a finite field and obtain a decoding algorithm that can recover more errors than half the minimum distance.
