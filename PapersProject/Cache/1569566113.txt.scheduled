xmlabstract -> THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD In this work we analyze achievable random coding error exponents pertaining to erasure/list decoding for channels with side information present at the transmitter. The analysis is carried out using the optimal decoding rule proposed by Forney. A key ingredient in the analysis is the evaluation of moments of a certain distance enumerator. This approach leads to a new exponentially tight bounds. These results are obtained by exploring a random binning code with conditionally constant composition codewords previously proposed by Moulin and Wang. Later, these results are used to obtain an achievable random coding error exponent for ordinary decoding.
