parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> This paper is concerned with interference alignment for multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO) cellular networks. An enhanced relay-aided interference alignment (eRIA) scheme is proposed. To align the interference, the scaling coefficients at relay is designed carefully and the design criterions of eRIA are given. The achievable degree-of-freedom (DoF) of eRIA is derived. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that eRIA can achieve higher DoF and require less time extensions compared with Suh's scheme [8].
