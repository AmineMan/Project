xmlabstract -> The design of pseudorandom sequences with optimal correlation properties forms a crucial part of communications and radar engineering. With the increasingly crowded electromagnetic spectrum, interference between different systems is becoming more important. In this paper, we consider the Low Probability of Intercept properties of some commonly used sequence families, with respect to their triple correlation function. The binary families we consider include the Gold sequence family, the Gold-like sequence family with quadratic span, and the Bent Function sequence family.
