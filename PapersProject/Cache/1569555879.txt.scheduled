xmlabstract -> This paper considers the multi-way relay channel (MWRC) where multiple users exchange messages via a single relay. The capacity region is derived for a special class of MWRCs where (i) the uplink and the downlink are separated in the sense that there is no direct user-to-user links, (ii) the channel is restricted in the sense that each user's transmitted channel symbols can depend on only its own message, but not on its received channel symbols, and (iii) the uplink is any deterministic function.
