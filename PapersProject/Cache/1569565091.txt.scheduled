xmlabstract -> THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD Finite length LT codes over higher order Galois fields for unequal error protection (UEP) are analysed under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. We consider a biased sampling method to create the LT code graph. In contrast to a previous approach by Rahnavard et. al., where a predetermined number of edges is created per importance class given a check node of degree d, our procedure allows to precisely adjust the desired class weights. Moreover, we provide upper and lower bounds on the symbol erasure probability for each importance class.
