xmlabstract -> We consider the capacity region of a three receiver broadcast channel with some message cognition at two receivers. The problem generalizes the bi-directional broadcast channel to include a third receiver, a common message and (partial) message cognition. We characterize the capacity region for several classes of less noisy, more capable, and deterministic broadcast channels.
