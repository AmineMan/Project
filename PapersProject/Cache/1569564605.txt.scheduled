xmlabstract -> In this paper, we study the relationships between the girth of the Tanner graph of a quasi cyclic (QC) protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, on one hand, and the lifting degree and the size and the structure of the base graph, on the other hand. As a result, for a given base graph and a given lifting degree, we derive an upper bound on the girth of the resulting lifted graphs (codes). The upper bounds derived here are generally tighter than the existing bounds. The results presented in this work can be used to select an appropriate lifting degree for a given base graph, in order to have a desired girth, or to provide some insight in designing good base graphs, or to properly select the base graph's edge permutations.
