xmlpapertitle -> Interference Alignment for Achieving both Full DOF and Full Diversity in the Broadcast Channel with Delayed CSIT
parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> Maddah-Ali and Tse have recently shown that delayed transmitter channel state information (CSIT) can still be useful in increasing the number of degree-of-freedom (DOF) in the MIMO broadcast channel, by constructing a scheme that, in the presence of two transmit antennas, and two single-antenna receivers, manages to achieve 4/3 DOF despite the fact that CSIT is stale by one coherence time. This same scheme though achieves these gains in DOF, but suppressing the inherent diversity of the broadcast parallel channel. The current work proposes a novel broadcast scheme which, over the above described setting, employs a form of interference alignment to achieve both full DOF as well as full diversity.
