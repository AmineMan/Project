xmlabstract -> Multicasting is the general method of conveying the same information to multiple users over a broadcast channel. In this work, the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel is considered, with several users and any number of antennas at each transmission link. A "closed loop" scenario is assumed, for which a practical capacity-achieving multicast scheme is constructed. In the proposed scheme, linear modulation is carried over time and space together, which allows to transform the problem into that of transmission over equal-gain parallel scalar channels. Over these channels, off-the-shelf fixed-rate AWGN codes can be used to approach capacity.
