xmlabstract -> A variety of low-density parity-check (LDPC) ensembles have now been observed to approach capacity with message passing decoding. However, all of them use soft (i.e., non-binary) messages and a posteriori probability (APP) decoding of their component codes. In this paper, we analyze iterative hard-decision decoding for a class of spatially-coupled generalized LDPC codes and observe that they can approach capacity in the high-rate regime. These codes can be seen as generalized product codes and are closely related to braided block codes.
