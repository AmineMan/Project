We have presented a new relaxed GaBP algorithm (R-GaBP)
to accelerate GaBP convergence for ill-conditioned weakly
diagonally dominant inverse covariance matrices. We have
demonstrated empirical reductions of up to 12.7 times. We
have also introduced
--
the new algorithms do not
require any increase of the computational complexity or the
memory requirements of the original GaBP algorithm hence
facilitating efﬁcient implementations on emerging parallel
architectures
