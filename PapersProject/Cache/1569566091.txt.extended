xmlabstract -> This paper examines the behavior of the minimum singular value of a random Vandermonde matrix. In particular, we prove that the minimum singular value $\lambda_1$ is at most $N^2\exp(-C\sqrt{N}))$ where $N$ is the dimension of the matrix and $C$ is a constant. Furthermore, the value of the constant $C$ is determined explicitly. The main result is obtain in two different ways. One approach uses techniques from stochastic processes and in particular, a construction related with the Brownian bridge. The other one, is a more direct analytical approach involving combinatorics and complex analysis. As a consequence, we obtain a result on the lower bound of the maximum of a random polynomial on the unit circle. We believe that this has independent mathematical interest.
