parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> This paper establishes new achievable rates for nonlinear Volterra communication channels using refined versions of the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. The characteristics of these rates are illuminated in special cases of interest that include time-invariant linear channels with memory, memoryless non-linear channels, and Volterra channel models.
