xmlabstract -> We consider the problem of lossy communication of correlated sources over multiple access channels with noiseless causal feedback. A sufficient condition for lossy transmission is presented, which generalizes several previous results on communication over multiple access channels, recovering as special cases channel coding results by King, Cover, and Leung, and extending a previous sufficient condition for lossless communication by Cover, El Gamal, and Salehi. The proposed coding scheme is based on a recently developed analog-digital hybrid coding scheme for joint source--channel coding combined with block-Markov coding.
