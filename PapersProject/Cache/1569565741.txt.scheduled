xmlpapertitle -> Construction of MIMO MAC Codes Achieving the Pigeon Hole Bound
parsed -> yes
xmlabstract -> This paper provides a general construction method for multiple-input multiple-output multiple access channel codes (MIMO MAC codes) that have so called generalized full rank property. The achieved constructions give a positive answer to the question whether it is generally possible to reach the so called pigeon hole bound, that is an upper bound for the decay of determinants of MIMO-MAC channel codes.
