According to [1], f (x) is called a p-ary bent function (or
generalized bent function) if all its Walsh coefﬁcients satisfy
|Sf (b)|2 = pn . A bent function f (x) is called regular (see
[1, Deﬁnition 3] and [2, p. 576]) if for every b ∈ Fpn
the normalized Walsh coefﬁcient p−n/2 Sf (b) is equal to a
∗
complex pth root of unity, i.e., p−n/2 Sf (b) = ω f (b) for some
function f ∗ mapping Fpn into Fp . A bent function f (x) is
called weakly regular if there exists a complex u having unit
∗
magnitude such that up−n/2 Sf (b) = ω f (b) for all b ∈ Fpn .
For a weakly regular function f , function f ∗ is called the dual
of f . Recently, weakly regular bent functions were shown to
be useful for constructing certain combinatorial objects such as
partial difference sets, strongly regular graphs and association
schemes (see [3], [4], [5]). This justiﬁes why the classes of
(weakly) regular bent functions are of independent interest.
All known univariate polynomials representing inﬁnite
classes of p-ary bent functions are listed in the table below.
Here ξ denotes a primitive element of F3n , r and wr refer to
regular and weakly regular bent functions respectively. The
ﬁrst eight families in the table are monomials of the form
Trn (axd ) while the last two are binomial bent functions in
the form Trn (F (x)). Also, for any a ∈ Fpn , deﬁne the
−1
Kloosterman sum K(a) = x∈Fpn wTrn (x+ax ) , where w is
a complex p-th primitive root of unity. These functions were
constructed and analyzed in [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12],
[13].
Deﬁnition 1: A class of bent functions is complete if it is
globally invariant under the action of the general afﬁne group
and under the addition of afﬁne functions. The completed class
of a set S of bent functions is the smallest possible complete
class of bent functions which includes S.
The following construction called Maiorana-McFarland
gives by far the widest class (denoted M) of bent functions,
compared to all the other primary constructions. In the binary
case, the completed class of M contains all quadratic bent
functions which are the simplest and best understood. However, this does not hold in the generalized case. First, for p odd
there exist quadratic bent functions over Fpn when n is odd

Abstract—In this paper, most of the known inﬁnite classes
of generalized bent functions are analyzed for their relation to
the completed Maiorana-McFarland class. This is done using
the criterion based on second-order derivatives of a function. In
particular, it is shown that, unlike in the binary case, not all
quadratic bent functions are EA-equivalent to a function of the
Maiorana-McFarland type. This is the ﬁrst attempt to rise this
problem for the generalized bent functions.

I. I NTRODUCTION AND P RELIMINARIES
Boolean bent functions were ﬁrst introduced by Rothaus in
1976 as an interesting combinatorial object with the important
property of having the maximum Hamming distance to the
set of all afﬁne functions. Later the research in this area
was stimulated by the signiﬁcant relation to the following
topics in computer science: coding theory, sequences and
cryptography (design of stream ciphers and S-boxes for block
ciphers). Kumar, Scholtz and Welch in [1] generalized the
notion of Boolean bent functions to the case of functions
over an arbitrary ﬁnite ﬁeld. Complete classiﬁcation of bent
functions looks hopeless even in the binary case. In the case
of generalized bent functions, things are naturally much more
complicated. However, many explicit methods are known for
constructing bent functions either from scratch or based on
other, simpler bent functions.
Given a function f (x) mapping Fpn to Fp , the direct and
inverse Walsh transform operations on f are deﬁned at a point
by the following respective identities:
ω f (x)−Trn (bx)

Sf (b) =

and

x∈Fpn

ω f (x) =

1
pn

Sf (b)ω Trn (bx)
b∈Fpn

where Trn () : Fpn → Fp denotes the absolute trace function,
2πi
ω = e p is the complex primitive pth root of unity and
elements of Fp are considered as integers modulo p.

while Maiorana-McFarland bent functions are deﬁned only for
n even. For the case n even, we provide examples of quadratic
generalized bent functions not belonging to the completed
class M. Moreover, it turns out that almost all of the known
classes do not intersect with the completed class M. This leads
us to the conclusion that in general, the Maiorana-McFarland
construction is less overall than in the binary case even for the
case n even.
Construction 1: [14], [1] Take any permutation π of Fm
p
and any function σ : Fm → Fp . Then f : Fm × Fm → Fp
p
p
p
with f (x, y) := x · π(y) + σ(y) is a bent function. Moreover,
the bijectiveness of π is necessary and sufﬁcient for f being
bent. Such bent functions are regular and the dual function is
equal to f ∗ (x, y) = y · π −1 (x) + σ(π −1 (x)).
The criterion for a function to be a member of the completed
class of M is known in its binary version when p = 2 (see
[14]). In the general case, the proof is similar and we skip it
here.
Proposition 1: For an even n, if a bent function f : Fpn →
Fp belongs to the completed class of M then there exists
an n/2-dimensional vector subspace V in Fpn such that the
second order derivatives

vanishes for any a, b ∈ V . Clearly Da,b f equals the sum of
the second order derivative of Trn (x2 ), which is constant and
equals 2Trn (ab), and the second order derivative of Trn (xd ).
Note ﬁrst that

Da Dc f (x) = f (x + a + c) − f (x + a) − f (x + c) + f (x)

is (a + b)p +1 − ap +1 − bp +1 = ap b + abp . Indeed,
the numbers t pi mod (pn − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, are cyclic
shifts of the vector t , and it is easy to note that t = t pi
mod (pn − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. It is also obvious that, any
cyclic shift of any vector t, t = t , of the form (2) is different
from t .
If Da,b f ≡ 0 for some a, b = 0 then all coefﬁcients of the
monomials in Da,b f must equal 0, and, in particular, we get
for the coefﬁcient of xt

of the monomial xt with
t = 0 ... 0 p − 1 ... p − 1 0 ... 0

vanish for any a, c ∈ V .
In the following section, we prove that all non-quadratic
cases of p-ary bent functions listed in the table above do not
belong to the completed class of M. We also show that in
contrast to the binary case, the completed class M does not
cover all quadratic bent functions.

Theorem 1: The bent function f (x) = Trn (xd + x2 ) over

belong to the completed class of M.
Proof: Assume that f is EA-equivalent to a function from
class M. Then there exists a 2k-dimensional vector space V ⊂
Fp4k such that the second order derivative of f

If there exists a 2k-dimensional vector space V such that
Da,b f ≡ 0 for all a, b ∈ V then Da,a f ≡ 0 for all a ∈ V , and
3k
therefore 2ap +1 = 0 by (3), a contradiction which shows
that V cannot exist.

t1 , tk = 0, t2i = 2, 1 ≤ i ≤ k−1. It is easy to see that t = t pi
mod (pn − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and that, any cyclic shift of any
vector t, t = t , of the form (4) is different from t . Therefore,

If u is a solution for the equation (cx2 )p −1 = −1 then cu2 +

any a, b ∈ Fpk .
Note 1: The bent function Trn (cx2 ) is not in the completed
class of M on Fpn for p = 3, 5, 7, 11 and n = 4, when c ∈ F∗n
p
is not a squire. Actually in these ﬁelds the proposition above
can be stated as ”if and only if” claim.
Theorem 5: The bent function f (x) = Trn (cxd ) over F3n ,
where n = 2k ≥ 6, d = t(3k − 1) with gcd(t, 3k + 1) = 1,
k
and c ∈ F3n with K(c3 +1 ) = 0, does not belong to the
completed class of M when t = 3i + w for some nonnegative
i and 0 ≤ w ≤ 2.
Proof: We just sketch the proof here since it is similar
to the ones of Theorems 1-3. We can assume without loss of
generality that 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1.
Let ﬁrst w = 0. Then we can assume that i = 0. We have
d = 3k − 1 = 2(3k−1 + 3k−2 + ... + 1) = 0 ... 0 2 ... 2 .

Assume that f is EA-equivalent to a function from class M.
Then there exists an n/2-dimensional vector space V ⊂ F3n
such that
Da,b f (x) = Trn c (x + a + b)d − (x + a)d − (x + b)d + xd
vanishes for any a, b ∈ V . In (x + a)d all the monomials have
the form xt with

In (x + a)d all the monomials are of the type xt with

mod (pn − 1), 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and that any cyclic shift of any

xt has the coefﬁcient 4a4 in (x + a)d , and therefore it has
coefﬁcient 4c((a + b)4 − a4 − b4 ) = 4c(ab3 + a3 b) in Da,b f .
If Da,a f ≡ 0 for some a ∈ F∗n then a4 = 0, a contradiction.

in particular choosing a = b we get 2ξ 4 a3 +3 = 0 for any

Theorem 4: The bent function f (x) = Trn (cx2 ) over Fpn ,

f belongs to the completed class of M if cp −1 = −1.
Proof: Let u ∈ Fp2k . Then for any a, b ∈ u Fpk we get
a = ua , b = ub for some a , b ∈ Fpk , and

If Da,b f ≡ 0 for some a, b = 0 then all coefﬁcients of
