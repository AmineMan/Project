Abstract—We investigate the connectivity of wireless sensor networks under the random pairwise key predistribution scheme of Chan et al. Under the assumption of full
visibility, this reduces to studying connectivity in the socalled random K-out graph H(n; K); here n is the number
of nodes and K < n is an integer parameter affecting the
number of keys stored at each node. We show that if K ≥ 2
(resp. K = 1), the probability that H(n; K) is a connected
graph approaches 1 (resp. 0) as n goes to inﬁnity. This is
done by establishing an explicitly computable lower bound
on the probability of connectivity. From this bound we
conclude that with K ≥ 2, the connectivity of the network
can already be guaranteed by a relatively small number
of sensors with very high probability. This corrects an
earlier analysis based on a heuristic transfer of classical
connectivity results for Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graphs.

scheme enables both node-to-node authentication and quorumbased node revocation.
Let H(n; K) denote the undirected random graph on the
vertex set {1, . . . , n} where distinct nodes i and j are adjacent
if they have a pairwise key in common as described earlier;
this random graph models the random pairwise predistribution
scheme under full visibility (whereby all nodes are within
wireless communication with each other). We seek conditions
on n and K under which H(n; K) is a connected graph
with very high probability as n grows large. As in the
case of the Eschenauer-Gligor scheme, such conditions may
provide guidelines for dimensioning purposes (although they
are possibly too optimistic given the full visibility assumption
used).
We report on the following zero-one law for connectivity
in H(n; K): With K ≥ 2 (resp. K = 1), the probability that
H(n; K) is a connected graph approaches 1 (resp. 0) as n
grows large. This is done by establishing a computable lower
bound on the probability of connectivity for each K ≥ 2.
Applying this lower bound with K = 2 we see that for
n = 20, the graph is connected with probability larger
than 0.98, whereas with only 50 sensors, this probability of
connectivity becomes larger than 0.999. Thus, connectivity
is already achievable with high probability under very small
values of K and n. These values are much smaller than the
ones implied by a heuristic transfer of classical connectivity
results from Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graphs (as was done in the original
o e
paper of Chan et al. [3] and in [8]). The results obtained here
correct misleading predictions made in these earlier papers,
and form the basis for a reappraisal of the scalability of the
random pairwise predistribution scheme; see [19], [22] for
details.
The random graph H(n; K) is known in the literature on
random graphs as the random K-out graph [1], [6], [13].
Fenner and Frieze [6, Thm. 2.1, p. 348] have established the
zero-one law given here by a completely different approach
which focuses on the vertex and edge connectivity parameters.
While their analysis also leads to a lower bound on the
probability of connectivity, the lower bound obtained here is
sharper than theirs for K ≥ 3.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we give a
formal model for the random pairwise predistribution scheme
of Chan et al., and introduce the induced random K-out graph.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Random key predistribution is one of the approaches proposed in the literature for addressing security challenges in
resource-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The
idea of randomly assigning secure keys to the sensor nodes
prior to network deployment was ﬁrst introduced by Eschenauer and Gligor [5]. Following their original work, a large
number of key predistribution schemes have been proposed;
see the survey articles [2], [15], [16], [17].
Here we consider the random pairwise key predistribution
scheme proposed by Chan et al. in [3]: Before deployment,
each of the n sensor nodes is paired (ofﬂine) with K distinct nodes which are randomly selected from amongst all
other nodes. For each sensor and any sensor paired to it,
a unique (pairwise) key is generated and stored in their
memory modules along with their ids. A secure link can
then be established between two communicating nodes if at
least one of them is paired to the other so that the two
nodes have at least one pairwise key in common. Precise
implementation details are given in Section II. The random
pairwise predistribution scheme has a number of advantages
over the scheme of Eschenauer and Gligor: (i) Even if some
nodes are captured, the secrecy of the remaining nodes is
perfectly preserved; (ii) Unlike earlier schemes, the pairwise

The main results of the paper concerning the connectivity of
random K-out graphs are presented in Section III; there we
also compare them against the earlier results of Fenner and
Frieze. Various comments are given in Section IV. Proofs are
omitted due to space limitations but can be found in [23].

hence the terminology pairwise predistribution scheme. The
key ring Σn,i (K) of node i is the set

II. M ODEL

As mentioned earlier, under full visibility, two nodes, say i
and j, can establish a secure link if at least one of the events
i ∈ Γn,j (K) or j ∈ Γn,j (K) takes place. Both events can take
place, in which case the memory modules of node i and j both
contain the distinct keys ωn,ij and ωn,ji . By construction this
scheme supports node-to-node authentication.

Σn,i (K)
(1)
= {ωn,ij , j ∈ Γn,i (K)} ∪ {ωn,ji , i ∈ Γn,j (K)}.

All statements involving limits, including asymptotic equivalences, are understood with n going to inﬁnity. The cardinality of any discrete set S is denoted by |S|.
A. The random pairwise key predistribution scheme
The random pairwise key predistribution scheme of Chan et
al. is parametrized by two positive integers n and K such that
K < n. There are n nodes which are labelled i = 1, . . . , n
with unique ids Id1 , . . . , Idn . Write N := {1, . . . n} and set
N−i := N − {i} for each i = 1, . . . , n. With node i we
associate a subset Γn,i (K) of nodes selected at random from
N−i – Each of the nodes in Γn,i (K) is said to be paired to
node i. Speciﬁcally, for any subset A ⊆ N−i , we require

−1
 n−1
if |A| = K
K
P [Γn,i (K) = A] =

0
otherwise.

B. The induced random graphs
Under full visibility the pairwise predistribution scheme
naturally gives rise to the following class of random graphs:
With n = 2, 3, . . . and positive integer K < n, the distinct
nodes i and j are said to be adjacent, written i ∼ j, if and
only if they have at least one key in common in their key
rings. Thus, with the notation (1), we have
i∼j
or, equivalently,

Thus, the selection of Γn,i (K) is done uniformly amongst
all subsets of N−i which are of size exactly K. The rvs
Γn,1 (K), . . . , Γn,n (K) are assumed to be mutually independent so that

i∼j

P [Γn,i (K) = Ai ]
i=1

for arbitrary A1 , . . . , An subsets of N−1 , . . . , N−n , respectively.
Once this ofﬂine random pairing has been created, we construct the key rings Σn,1 (K), . . . , Σn,n (K), one for each node,
as follows: Assumed available is a collection of nK distinct
cryptographic keys {ωi| , i = 1, . . . , n; = 1, . . . , K}. These
keys are drawn from a very large pool of keys; in practice the
pool size is assumed to be much larger than nK, and can be
safely taken to be inﬁnite for the purpose of our discussion.
Now, ﬁx i = 1, . . . , n and let n,i : Γn,i (K) → {1, . . . , K}
denote a labeling of Γn,i (K). For each node j in Γn,i (K)
paired to i, the cryptographic key ωi| n,i (j) is associated with
j. For instance, if the random set Γn,i (K) is realized as
{j1 , . . . , jK } with 1 ≤ j1 < . . . < jK ≤ n, then an obvious
labeling consists in n,i (jk ) = k for each k = 1, . . . , K with
key ωi|k associated with node jk . Of course other labeling are
possible. e.g., according to decreasing labels or according to
a random permutation. Finally, the pairwise key
ωn,ij = [Idi |Idj |ωi|

n,i (j)

iff i ∈ Γn,j (K) ∨ j ∈ Γn,i (K).

(2)

Let H(n; K) denote the undirected random graph on the vertex
set {1, . . . , n} induced by the adjacency notion (2). In the
literature on random graphs, the random graph H(n; K) is
usually referred to as a random K-out graph [1], [6], [13].
We close with some notation. Throughout we write

P [Γn,i (K) = Ai , i = 1, . . . , n] =

iff Σn,i (K) ∩ Σn,j (K) = ∅,

P (n; K) = P [ H(n; K) is connected ] .
Furthermore, let λ(n; K) denote the probability of edge assignment (between any two nodes) in H(n; K). Under the
enforced independence assumptions, it is plain from (2) that

A. A tight bound and its consequences
Our main technical result is given next; its proof, given in
[23], adapts classical arguments used for proving the one-law
for connectivity in Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graphs [4, Section 3.4.2, p.
o e
42].
Theorem 3.1: For any positive integer K ≥ 2, the bound

P (n; K) ≥ 1 − a(K)Q(n; K)

holds for all n ≥ n(K) with n(K) = 4(K + 2).
The bound (5) gives some indication as to how fast the
convergence limn→∞ P (n; K) = 1 occurs when K ≥ 2, with
the convergence becoming faster with larger K as would be
expected; see also (7) below. Although the right handside of
(5) may be negative for small values of n (in which case the
bound is trivial), it is already positive when n = 2(K + 1)
(hence also past n(K)).
For K = 2, since n(2) = 16, the bound (5) becomes

The one-law in Theorem 3.2 is immediate from either (11)
or (12) since H(n; K) is connected if either Cv (n; K) ≥ 1 or
Ce (n; K) ≥ 1. The zero-law in Theorem 3.2 coincides with
(13), and was obtained in [6] with the help of results by Katz
[11] concerning random mappings. In [23] we give a completely different proof for (13); it uses classical enumeration
results for the set of undirected graphs on n nodes which are
connected and have exactly n edges [7, p. 133-134].
Inspection of the proof of Theorem 3.4 given in [6, Thm.

This follows from Eqn. 2.2 in [6, p. 349] with p = 0; note
that the parameter K used here is denoted m in [6].
The lower bound (14) has the same form as the one given
in Theorem 3.1, but is weaker (i.e., is a smaller lower bound)
than (5) except for K = 2. Indeed it is easy to check that

(9)

The one-law in Theorem 3.2 is an easy consequence of
the bound (5), while the zero-law of Theorem 3.2 is proved
separately in [23]. Theorem 3.2 easily yields the behavior of
graph connectivity as the parameter K is scaled with n, but
ﬁrst some terminology: We refer to any mapping K : N0 →
N0 as a scaling whenever it satisﬁes the natural conditions
Kn < n,

(14)

a(K) ≤ b(K) ≤ b(n; K),

K = 3, . . . , n − 1

with limn→∞ b(n; K) = b(K) monotonically from above.
In order to better understand how these lower bounds
compare with each other, observe that

if Kn ≥ 2 for all n sufﬁciently large.

Thus, the lower bound given in Theorem 3.1 for the probability
of network connectivity approaches one much faster than the
bound (14) inferred from [6]. To illustrate this fact, with
n = 50 we have plotted the behavior of a(K), b(K) and
b(n; K) with respect to K in Figure 1. As expected from the
remarks above, a(K) approaches zero much faster (in fact
exponentially fast) than b(n; K) as K increases. Although
K = 2 is already enough to ensure connectivity with high
probability, in a realistic WSN setting, we expect K to

B. Earlier results of Fenner and Frieze
Related results have appeared earlier: Fix n = 2, 3, . . . and
consider a positive integer K < n. We deﬁne the vertex
connectivity Cv (n; K) of H(n; K) as the minimum number
of its vertices whose deletion disconnects H(n; K). The edge
connectivity Ce (n; K) is deﬁned similarly in terms of edges.
Fenner and Frieze have established the following result in
terms of these quantities [6, Thm. 2.1, p. 348].

intricate.

C. Earlier analysis via transfers

b (n; K ), n = 50

In the original paper of Chan et al. [3] (as in the reference [8]), the connectivity of H(n; K) was analyzed through
the following two-step process: (i) First, the random graph
H(n; K) was equated with an Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graph so that the
o e
edge assignment probabilities are asymptotically equivalent;
(ii) Then, classical connectivity results for Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graphs
o e
were formally transferred to H(n; K) under this constraint.
We revisit this transfer argument in some details: First, there
is no loss of generality in writing any scaling p : N0 → [0, 1]
for the edge assignment probability in Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graphs in
o e
the form
log n + αn
pn =

the property of graph connectivity admits the zero-one law

Fig. 1. For n = 50, we compare the coefﬁcients a(K), b(K) and b(n; K). It
is clear that a(K) < b(K) < b(n; K) for all K = 3, 4, . . ., so that the lower
bound 1 − a(K)Q(n; K) obtained here is stronger (i.e., larger) than the lower
bound 1 − b(n; K)Q(n; K) derived in [6].

take larger values in order to accommodate other network
requirements and to ensure connectivity under severe channel
conditions [21].

(16)

It is tempting to use this result as follows: A given scaling
K : N0 → N0 is said to be asymptotically matched to a
scaling p : N0 → [0, 1] for Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graphs provided
o e
λ(n; Kn ) ∼ pn . This ensures that the expected degrees (per
node) in the random graphs G(n; pn ) and H(n; Kn ) are
asymptotically equivalent. In view of (3) this requirement
amounts to

IV. C OMMENTS
We now provide some comments concerning the results.
A. Correlated edge assignments
For each p in [0, 1] and n = 2, 3, . . ., let G(n; p) denote
the Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graph on the vertex set {1, . . . , n} with edge
o e
probability p. While edge assignments are mutually independent in G(n; p), they are strongly correlated in H(n; K) in that
they are negatively associated in the sense of Joag-Dev and
Proschan [10]; see [18], [21] for details. Thus, H(n; K) cannot
be equated with G(n; p) even when the parameters p and K
are selected so that the edge assignment probabilities in these
two graphs coincide, say λ(n; K) = p. As a result, neither
Theorem 3.1 nor Corollary 3.3 are consequences of classical
results for Erd˝ s-Renyi graphs [1]. See also the discussion in
o
Section IV-C.

If the scaling p : N0 → [0, 1] is put in the form (15) for some
deviation sequence α : N0 → R, then (17) becomes

(18)

With this identiﬁcation, one might expect the random graphs
G(n; pn ) and H(n; Kn ) to behave in tandem, at least asymptotically, and by analogy the following zero-one law

 0 if limn→∞ αn = −∞
lim P (n; Kn ) =
(19)
n→∞

1 if limn→∞ αn = +∞

B. Connectivity vs. absence of isolated nodes
To drive the point further, note the following: In many
known classes of random graphs, the absence of isolated
nodes and graph connectivity are asymptotically equivalent
properties, e.g., Erd˝ s-R´ nyi graphs [1], [4], geometric random
o e
graphs [12] and random key graphs [14], [18], [20]. This
equivalence, when it holds, is exploited by ﬁrst establishing the
zero-one law for the absence of isolated nodes, a step which is
usually much simpler to complete with the help of the method
of ﬁrst and second moments [9, p. 55]. However, there are no
isolated nodes in H(n; K) since each node is of degree at least
K. Thus, the class of random graphs studied here provides an
example where graph connectivity and the absence of isolated
nodes are not asymptotically equivalent properties; in fact this

should then hold by a formal transfer of (16). This approach,
though appealing for its simplicity, leads to incorrect conclusions as we now show.
Indeed, consider a scaling K : N0 → N0 such that Kn =
K for some positive integer K for all n sufﬁciently large.
On that range, the requirement (18) leads to the corresponding
deviation function α : N0 → R being given by
αn =

for some sequence t : N0 → R+ with limn→∞ tn =
1. Thus, we have limn→∞ αn = −∞ regardless of the
value of K , and according to (19) we would conclude that
limn→∞ P (n; K ) = 0 for all positive integers K , in clear
contradiction with Theorem 3.2.
We could also have used a weaker version of the zero-one
law (16) which considers scalings p : N0 → [0, 1] of the form

design decisions: For instance, the maximum supportable
network size evaluated in [3], [8] leads to the conclusion
that the random pairwise key predistribution scheme is not
scalable in the context of WSNs. The results given here form
the basis for a reevaluation of these conclusions; see [19], [22]
for details.
