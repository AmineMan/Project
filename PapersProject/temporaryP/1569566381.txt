K-receiver case in [8]. The capacity region of a degraded
Gaussian BRC, for which DF is optimal, is established in
[9]. Another DF relaying based achievable scheme, which
improves upon [6] is found in [10]. Finally, an outer bound
on the capacity region of BRC is derived by jointly exploiting
the ideas of outer bounds on the broadcast channel and the
cut-set bound in [11].
As the above references suggest, all the achievability
schemes for the BRC combine either superposition or Marton
coding with DF relaying. However, DF relaying does not
perform well, unless the relay can easily decode the source
signal. In such cases, it is advantageous if the relay performs
CF.
Although there is not much attention in the BRC set-up,
various types of CF relaying are used in other relay networks.
The naive CF technique, which is a straightforward extension
of simple CF [2], is used in the two-way relay channel
setting in [12]. A successive reﬁnement based CF scheme
is suggested for the two-way relay channel in [13]. The socalled generalized CF and nCF based achievability schemes
are proposed for the interference relay channel in [14]. In
[15], the authors extend the joint source-channel coding result
of [16] to the multiple multicast single relay network. CF
based achievable rates are also derived for simultaneous relay
channels in [10]. In [17], noisy network coding is proposed
for general multicast networks.
None of the above results are directly applicable to the BRC,
in which a single source node broadcasts a different message
to each destination. In this work, we investigate CF based
achievability schemes for the BRC. We ﬁrst study naive CF
(nCF), in which the relay forms a single representation and
uses Wyner-Ziv binning to send the compressed signal to both
destinations. Secondly, we investigate joint CF (jCF). Similar
to nCF, jCF generates a single compression, but avoids WynerZiv binning. Finally, we propose using multiple description
coding based CF (mdCF) at the relay. Multiple description
coding is a source coding technique, in which a source is
encoded into multiple representations at different levels of

Abstract—In this work, the broadcast relay channel (BRC)
with one source, two destinations and a dedicated relay node
is studied for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels.
Unlike all the existing achievability schemes, which use decodeand-forward (DF) relaying for the BRC, the new achievability schemes are based on compress-and-forward (CF). Three
different compression methods are proposed: naive, joint and
multiple description coding based. In naive CF (nCF) and joint
CF (jCF), the relay forms a single representation, conveying
its observation to both destinations at a single quality level.
On the other hand, in multiple description coding based CF
(mdCF), the relay utilizes multiple description coding and forms
two representations, which allows for the two destinations to
receive the relay observation at different quality levels. Through
Gaussian examples, it is observed that mdCF enlarges nCF and
jCF rate regions. Moreover, mdCF is the only scheme, which
can achieve both of the single user CF rates achievable in the
constituent single user relay channels.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The idea of increasing achievable rates in point-to-point
channels by relaying dates back to [1]. The capacity of some
classes of relay channels was studied and decode-and-forward
(DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) schemes were proposed
in [2]. Another building block in multiuser networks is the
broadcast channel [3]. The capacity region for degraded broadcast channels was established in [4] and superposition coding
was proved to be the capacity achieving encoding scheme.
Although superposition coding is optimal for degraded, less
noisy or more capable broadcast channels, it is known to be
suboptimal in general. Marton coding [5], on the other hand,
gives the best known achievable rate region for the general
broadcast channel.
As in point-to-point channels, relaying can enable signiﬁcant gains in the rate region of broadcast channels. The
broadcast relay channel (BRC), which models the transmission
between one source and two destinations with the aid of a
dedicated relay, is ﬁrst studied in [6]. In [6], the authors ﬁnd
an achievable scheme using Marton coding and DF relaying.
A superposition coding and DF relaying based achievability
scheme is proposed in [7]. This result is extended to the

III. M AIN R ESULTS
In this section, we propose ﬁve new achievable schemes
for the BRC. In the ﬁrst and second schemes, the source
respectively uses Marton coding and superposition coding. In
both cases the relay does Wyner-Ziv binning on the single
representation it forms, which is reconstructed at both destinations. We call this type of compression naive. In the third
scheme called jCF, the relay adopts the source coding idea
of [16] and does not perform any binning on the compressed
signal. The source does superposition coding. In the fourth
and ﬁfth schemes the source respectively employs Marton and
superposition coding. In both cases the relay compresses its
observation into two different representations using multiple
description coding and forwards them to the destinations using
superposition coding. In the following, we will omit all the
proofs due to space limitations.

quality [18]. In mdCF scheme we suggest, unlike nCF or
jCF, the relay constructs two descriptions of its observation instead of just one. The relay then uses superposition
coding to convey these descriptions to the destinations. The
source can broadcast its messages using either superposition
or Marton coding. We compare our results with nCF and
jCF techniques and show that the relay does not need to
adjust the compression rate according to the worse relaydestination link, or the worse available side information at the
destinations, but can send its observation at different quality
levels to the destinations. In [13], an alternative solution is
proposed from a successive reﬁnement coding perspective.
However, in successive reﬁnement coding based approach,
both destinations should reconstruct the coarser description,
which leads to a different tradeoff between the ﬁdelity levels
of two descriptions. In mdCF, we tailor each description to its
own destination individually.
The organization of the paper is as follows: Section II
describes the system model for the BRC. Section III presents
the new achievable rate regions, Section IV extends the
achievability schemes to Gaussian channels and Section V
concludes the paper.

We consider a discrete memoryless broadcast relay channel
(X × Xr , p(yr , y1 , y2 |x, xr ), Yr × Y1 × Y2 ), which consists of
a transmitter with channel input x ∈ X , a dedicated relay with
relay input xr ∈ Xr and relay output yr ∈ Yr , two receivers
with channel outputs y1 ∈ Y1 and y2 ∈ Y2 , and a channel
probability transition function p(yr , y1 , y2 |x, xr ). As the BRC

To achieve this rate pair, the source uses Marton coding, and
the relay does naive CF. In naive CF, the relay compresses its
observation in Wyner-Ziv fashion to form only one description.
The maximization in (2) indicates that the compression rate
must be adjusted to the worse side information, either y1 or
y2 ; and the minimization in (2) implies that the compressed
signal yr must be reliably decoded at both destinations. To
ˆ
enable cooperation among the source and the relay, a block
Markov coding structure is used, and the encoding is carried
over B blocks. Decoding is backwards at both destinations.
In each block, the destinations ﬁrst decode the relay signal
xr , treating the source signal x as noise. Then they obtain

To achieve this rate pair, the source uses Marton coding; and
the relay does multiple description coding based compression.
The relay then sends these two descriptions to the destinations
using superposition coding. As in the previous achievability
schemes, a block Markov coding structure is used, and the
encoding is carried over B blocks. Backward decoding is used
at both destinations. Note that, instead of transmitting y2 at

the base layer, the relay can send y1 at the base layer. If

this is case, the subscripts 1 and 2 in (7) and (8) must be

superposition coding and the relay does nCF. Similar to

Note that, switching the order of superposition at the source
is also possible and can increase the achievable rates.
The strict constraint on the compression rate posed by
nCF relaying can be loosened if an advanced compression
technique [16], is used. In the following theorem, we present
the rates achievable with jCF in the BRC.

To achieve this rate pair, the source uses superposition
coding, and the relay does jCF over B blocks. The destinations
employ backward decoding. Note that, switching the order of
superposition is also possible and can increase the achievable
rates.
Similar to nCF, in jCF, the relay compresses its observation
according to the side informations available at the destinations.
However, unlike nCF, there is no explicit binning operation.
In jCF, each destination forms a list of possible compressed
versions. The length of each user’s list depends on its relaydestination link quality. Destinations further resolve the uncertainty in the list by using their own side informations.
Although the constraint on the compression rate is relaxed with
respect to nCF, the relay should still choose a compression
rate which ensures that both destinations can resolve the
uncertainty in their lists. Therefore, jCF is also limited by the
fact that there is a single representation. However, if multiple
description coding is used at the relay, the relay can send
two different descriptions at two different distortions. This will
enable an improved system with more degrees of freedom. In

which is equal to the relay channel CF rate for the ﬁrst
destination in the absence of the second destination. Similarly,
setting α = 1 and β = 1 and choosing an appropriate
superposition order, mdCF achieves the relay channel CF rate
for the second destination, while the ﬁrst destination has rate
0.
For the numerical results, we investigate our achievability schemes for two scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, hr =
1.25, h1 = 0.64, h2 = 1.00, hr1 = 1.75 and hr2 = 50. This is
the case, where the relay is very close to the second destination
but not so close to the ﬁrst destination. In the second scenario,
the channel gains are hr = 1, h1 = 1, h2 = 8, hr1 = 4, hr2 =
4. The second scenario corresponds to the case, where the relay
is close to the both destinations and the second destination has
a strong direct link. In both scenarios, the source and the relay
transmit powers are P = Pr = 10 dB and the noise variances
are Nr = N1 = N2 = 0 dB.
In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we plot the rate regions achievable
with nCF (Theorem 2), jCF (Theorem 3), mdCF (Theorem 5)
and DF [9]. Although the theorem statements are given for
only one superposition order, here we plot the convex hull
of all possible superposition orders for all schemes, which
is also achievable via time sharing. We also plot four points
on the ﬁgures: the relay channel CF rates and relay channel
cut-set bounds. The relay channel CF rates indicate the rates
achievable with CF [2] at ith destination, i = 1, 2, if the
other destination did not exist in the system. Similarly, the
relay channel cut-set bounds [19] indicate an upper bound on
rates achievable at ith destination, i = 1, 2, assuming the other
destination is not present.
In Fig. 2, we observe that nCF and jCF result in the same
rate region as for certain relations between channel gains
ˆ nCF = N jCF and nCF and jCF result in the same rate

region. The mdCF scheme improves upon these schemes and
achieves a larger rate region. However, in this ﬁrst scenario, as
hr and h1 are comparable, CF based schemes are not favorable
from the ﬁrst destination’s perspective and DF achieves larger
rates. Yet, it is interesting to observe that mdCF is the only
scheme, which achieves the relay channel CF rates for both
destinations. Fig. 2 also suggests that a combination of DF and

The Gaussian noises at the relay and at the ith destination
are i.i.d with zero-mean and variances Nr and Ni , respectively.
hr , hi and hri are the corresponding channel gains of sourcerelay, source-ith destination and relay-ith destination links.
The source and the relay power constraints are E{X 2 } = P

and E{Xr } = Pr .
We ﬁrst consider nCF and jCF schemes, in which only a
single representation of Yr is formed at the relay. Let the
compressed version of the relay’s observation is deﬁned as
ˆ

R EFERENCES

CF schemes can be especially useful in networks with multiple
receivers. Similar to Fig. 2, in Fig. 3, we observe that mdCF
is the only scheme, which connects the two relay channel CF
rate points. As nCF and jCF form only one representation
for the relay’s observation, they are unable to create a balance
between relay channel CF rates for each destination. Note that
the mdCF proposed in this paper is separation based, i.e. it ﬁrst
requires the relay signal (V and/or Xr ) and then the related
ˆ
ˆ
representation (Y1 and Y2 ) to be decoded at the corresponding
receivers. However this condition can be relaxed if the joint
coding scheme of [16] is employed, leading into a larger mdCF
based rate region then the shown in Fig. 3.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this work the four terminal broadcast relay channel with
one source, two destinations and a dedicated relay node is
studied for both discrete memoryless channels and Gaussian
channels. Three types of CF based achievability schemes are
presented. In naive CF and joint CF, there is a single compressed signal, which has to be decoded at both destinations.
This limits the compression quality to be adjusted to the worse
relay-destination link and/or the worse side information. On
the other hand, in multiple-description coding based CF, the
relay produces two different representations at two different
ﬁdelity levels, which are then broadcast to the two destinations.
It is observed that multiple description based CF improves
upon both naive CF and joint CF, and is the only scheme that
merges the relay channel CF rates; i.e. the rates achievable
with CF at each destination, assuming the other destination is
not present. The new achievability schemes also improve upon
DF based relaying schemes, especially when the decoding
requirement at the relay is too restrictive. Future work includes
studying advanced joint-source channel coding schemes at the
relay.
