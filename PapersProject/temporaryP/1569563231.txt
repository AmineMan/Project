(v). 4r ≡ 1 (mod 2m + 1) (see [3]).
In this paper, we will study a sequence of period q − 1 and
three decimated sequence of period (q − 1)/3 with decimation
d = (2m − 1)r + 1 and 5r ≡ 1 (mod 2m + 1). The
cross correlation values, as well as their distributions, will be
determined. It will be shown that all cross correlations are four
valued with small maximal magnitude.

Abstract—Let m be odd and q = 22m . Let 5r ≡ 1
(mod 2m + 1) and d = (2m − 1)r + 1. In this paper, the cross
correlation distributions of an m-sequence s with period q − 1
and its decimated sequences s(dt + l) with period (q − 1)/3 for
0 ≤ l ≤ 2 are determined. These cross correlations are shown to
√
be four-valued with maximal magnitude 2 q − 1.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Let s = {s(t)} and s′ = {s′ (t)} be two binary sequences
of the same period n. The cross correlation function between
s and s′ by a shift τ , 0 ≤ τ < n is deﬁned by

II. M AIN RESULT
Before stating the main result, we introduce some notations
and auxiliary tools. Let q = 22m with m odd and g be a
primitive element of GF (q). Let 5r ≡ 1 (mod 2m + 1) and
d = (2m − 1)r + 1. Then gcd(d, q − 1) = 3.
For a, b ∈ GF (q), deﬁne

Sequences with low cross correlations have wide applications in radar and CDMA communication system. Theoretically, it is hard to ﬁnd the distribution of the cross correlation
function for all shifts. For basic knowledge and applications
of sequences, we refer to [3],[6],[10].
Let q = 2n with n = 2m and g be a primitive element of
GF (q). Let s = {s(t) = Tr(g t )}q−2 be an m-sequence of
t=0
period q − 1 and s′ = {s′ (t) = Tr(g dt )}q−2 be the decimated
t=0
sequence of s with (d, q − 1) = 1. The decimation d = (2m −
1)r + 1 is said to be of (binary) Niho type and was ﬁrstly
studied by Niho in his thesis [6]. Niho proved that, the cross
correlation values are of the form (N (b) − 1) · 2m − 1 where
N (b) is the number of common solutions to

Lemma 1. The equation fc (u) = 0 has multiple roots if and
only if c ∈ S. In this case,
(i). fc (u) has exactly one root u = 1 if c = 1;
(ii). fc (u) has exactly two roots u = c, c1/4 if c ∈ S\{1}.
¯

=1

where ¯ = b2 . This result has been extended to the nonb
binary case by Rosendahl, see [9]. For a survey of Niho type
sequences, see [4] and [8].
To our best knowledge, the cross correlation distribution for
the following Niho type decimations d = (2m − 1) · r + 1 have
been found:
(i). r = 2 with m even (see [6]),
(ii). r = 3 with m odd (see [2]),
(iii). (2m/2 − 1) · r ≡ 2m/2 (mod 2m + 1) with m even (see
[6]),
(iv). (2k ± 1) · r ≡ 2k (mod 2m + 1) with m/(m, k) even (see
[1], [2] and [5]),
m

Proof: Since fc (u) = 0 has multiple roots if and only
′
if fc (u) and its derivative fc (u) have a nontrivial greatest
common divisor, then we have
gcd(u5 + cu4 + cu + 1, u4 + c) = gcd(cu4 + 1, u4 + c) = 1
¯

and equivalently, c¯ = 1. The remaining part is easy to verify.

Now we state a result which can be used to reduce the
number of possible values of T (a, b).

and e = e0 = 2. Suppose u0 , u1 , u2 ∈ S are three distinct
solutions of fc (u) = 0. Then the other two solutions are

+ au2 + bu + c, a, b, c ∈ GF (2n ).

u4 = u1,α,α2 = u0 u1 u2 ·
u5 = u1,α2 ,α = u0 u1 u2 ·

Q has either 0, 1, 2, or 2e0 + 1 roots u ∈ GF (2n ), where
e0 = gcd(e, n).
Moreover, if Q has three different roots, say u0 , u1 , u2 ∈
GF (2n ), then the collection of all, i.e., 2e0 +1 roots in GF (2n )
can be parameterized as follows:
uA0 ,A1 ,A2 = u0 u1 u2 ·

where A0 , A1 , A2 ∈ GF (2e0 ), (A0 , A1 , A2 ) = (0, 0, 0), and
A0 + A1 + A2 = 0. We have
uA0 ,A1 ,A2 = uB0 ,B1 ,B2
if and only if
(A0 , A1 , A2 ) = γ(B0 , B1 , B2 ) for some γ ∈ GF (2e0 )∗ .

Lemma 4. Let g be a primitive element of GF (q). For T (a, b)
deﬁned in (2), the following identities hold:

Lemma 3. For a, b ∈ GF (q) and (a, b) = (0, 0), T (a, b)
takes values −1 + i · 2m with i = −1, 0, 1, 2.

(T (a, b) + 1) = 24m ,

(i).
a,b∈GF (q)

(T (1, b) + 1) = 22m ,

Proof: It is easy to verify that the statement is valid if
ab = 0. For b = 0, by changing variable x → b−1 x we
have T (a, b) = T (c, 1) with c = ab−d . Then from Niho’s
observation (see Niho [6]), we have

b∈GF (q)

(T (g, b) + 1) = 22m ;
b∈GF (q)

(T (a, b) + 1) = 26m ,

1/u0 + α2 /u1 + α/u2
u0 + α2 u1 + αu2

where α is a primitive element of GF (4), i.e., 1+α +α2 = 0.
Since m is odd, we have α = α2 . It is easy to verify
¯
u4 = u−1 and u5 = u−1 . If fc (u) = 0 has ﬁve roots in S,
¯
¯

4
then u4 , u5 ∈ S which implies that u4 = u5 −1 = u5 . Hence
¯
fc (u) = 0 has multiple roots. By Lemma 1, fc (u) = 0 has
only one or two roots, a contradiction. Therefore fc (u) = 0
has at most three roots in S and N (c) ≤ 3.
Summarizing, the result follows from (4).
Now we need several moment identities.

∗
a,b∈GF (q)
Firstly we will show that, for any c ∈ GF (q) , the equation
(5) has at most ﬁve solutions in S. Setting x = u5 with u ∈ S.
Proof:
Then we have

cu10r−5 + u5r + u5r−5 + c = 0.

since both second and third inner sums are 22m or 0
fc (u) := u5 + cu4 + cu + 1 = 0

according to x = 0 or not. Similarly,
with u ∈ S. This equation has at most ﬁve solutions in S for
(T (1, b) + 1)
any c ∈ GF (q)∗ and so does (5).
b∈GF (q)
d
Now we will claim that it can not have exactly four
=
(−1)Tr(x )
(−1)Tr(bx)
distinct solutions in S. Otherwise, suppose the four distinct
x∈GF (q)
b∈GF (q)
solutions are xi ∈ S (1 ≤ i ≤ 4). Then the ﬁfth solution
= 22m
−1
x5 = (x1 x2 x3 x4 ) is also in S. But since (6) has only four
and
distinct solutions, then (6) must have multiple roots in S. Then
by Lemma 1, fc (u) = 0 has only one or two solutions in S
(T (g, b) + 1)
b∈GF (q)
which is a contradiction.

(−1)Tr(gx )

As a consequence (6) has 0, 1, 2, 3 or 5 solutions in S.

Secondly, we exploit Lemma 2 to reduce the possible

number of solutions of fc (u) = 0. Here we have n = 2m

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Solving the system equations consisting of (15)-(18) we obtain
the value distribution of T (a, b) for (a, b) = (0, 0).
Combing Lemma 5 and Theorem 1, we deduce the following result.

2m − 1 where N (c) is the number of solutions of fc (u) = 0
in S with c = ab−d . By Lemma 1, if c ∈ S\{1}, fc (u) = 0
has exactly two roots in S. Hence for any c = ab−d ∈ S\{1},
we have T (a, b) = 2m − 1.
• If a = 1, then for any c ∈ S\{1}, there exists b ∈ GF (q)
such that c = b−d if and only if c is a cubic (remember
gcd(d, q − 1) = 3). There are (2m − 2)/3 cubics c in
S\{1}. For each such c, there are three b satisfying c =
b−d . Therefore, E2 ≥ (2m − 2)/3 · 3 = 2m − 2.
