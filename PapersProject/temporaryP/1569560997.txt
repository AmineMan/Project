of active users want to share a secret key as a function of
the source sequences. It should be asymptotically uniformly
random to a wiretapper who wiretaps the observations of a
subset D ⊆ Ac := V \ A of untrusted users. The users in
V \(A∪D) are trusted helpers, who need not share the key and
whose observations are not revealed directly to the wiretapper.
The users are allowed to discussion in public as in [2] but
the entire discussion is revealed to the wiretapper. Unlike [2],
however, we consider a more general model where the key
is restricted to be a function of the iid sequence of a secret
source G that is a deterministic function of ZV characterized
by some conditional distribution PG|ZV . The original model
in [2] is the unrestricted case G = ZV when |A| ≥ 2. The
secret source may correspond to some sensitive information
that needs to be protected as much as possible as in [6, 7].
However, the objective here is not to recover the secret source
securely but to extract a key from it. The secret source acts as
an artiﬁcial parameter that conﬁnes the choices of the secret
key to a smaller set.
A simpliﬁed secret key agreement protocol is as follows.
Each user i ∈ V observes an n-sequence Zn := (Zit : t ∈ [n])
i
of his private source, where [n] := {1, . . . , n} for any positive
integer block length n ∈ P. They broadcast F := (Fi : i ∈ V )
in public over an authenticated noiseless channel where Fi is
the message from user i ∈ V as a function of Zn at rate
i

Abstract—A secret key agreement problem is proposed with
the additional restriction that the key is a function of a given
secret source. An inner bound to the achievable rates, error and
secrecy exponents is derived. The maximum key rate strongly
achievable with positive exponents is characterized. The result
leads to class of admissible restrictions on the key functions that
does not diminish the strongly achievable key rate.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The problem of multiterminal secret key agreement consists of a wiretapper and a set of users. The users observe
correlated iid source sequences and then discuss in public
until a subset of them, called the active users, can agree on
a nearly uniformly random secret key that is asymptotically
secure from the wiretapper who listens to the entire public
discussion. The maximum achievable rate, called the secrecy
capacity, was characterized in [2]. It was shown to be strongly
achievable in the sense that the amount of leaked information
not only decays to zero but at an exponential rate in the
block length. However, the precise exponent, called the secrecy
exponent, was not characterized. Its positivity was shown only
by averaging over all possible choices of key functions at rate
below the capacity. This random coding argument gives little
insight as to how the key should be chosen in practice and
how small the coding complexity can be. Although it was
shown later in [3] that the secret key can be restricted to
be purely a function of the source sequence observed by any
one active user, the capacity was shown to be achievable only
weakly, i.e. the amount of leaked information may decay to
zero subexponentially. It was not clear whether the restriction
on the key function comes at the cost of strong security.
The purpose of this work is to characterize an achievable
secrecy exponent and explore the admissible choices of key
functions that can achieve the capacity strongly. In doing so,
we formulate a more general secret key agreement problem
in §II where the key is chosen from a restricted class of
functions, e.g. a set of linear functions on a component source.
The secrecy exponent is derived in §IV using the privacy
ampliﬁcation theorem from [4, 5] introduced in §III.

unrestricted secrecy capacity. Any G that maximizes the

other order 1 + s ∈ (1, 2] using the inequality ln(1 + δ) ≤ δs
for δ ≥ 0 and s ∈ (0, 1]. The improvement is obtained, in
particular, by tightening the bound on ln(1 + δ) with s ↓ 0
instead of s = 1 when δ becomes large. In essence of this,
we will use the following more direct inequality without the
additional optimization over the parameter s.

III. P RIVACY AMPLIFICATION
The main ingredient for computing the achievable exponents is the privacy ampliﬁcation theorem from [4]. We will
introduce it using some simpliﬁed models.

ln(1 + δ) ≤ min{1, δ} max{1, ln(1 + δ)}

∀δ ≥ 0

Scalar model:
A user observing X wants to extract a key K as a function of
X as securely as possible against a wiretapper observing W.
The level of secrecy is measured by the index
(
)
1
ς := D PK|W |K| = ln|K| − H(K|W)
(7)

which is simply ln(1 + δ) ≤ δ for δ ∈ [0, 1] and ln(1 + δ) ≤
max{1, ln(1 + δ)} otherwise. We can apply this inequality to
(11) with δ = (|K| − 1)PX|W (X|W), in which case

which is zero iff K is uniformly distributed independent of W.
The objective is to characterize the optimal tradeoff between
the secrecy index ς and key size |K|.

where the last inequality is because PX|W (X|W) ≤ 1 and
|K| ≥ 3 > e. This gives (9) as desired.
■

min{1, δ} ≤ min{1, |K|PX|W (X|W)}
max{1, ln(1 + δ)} ≤ max{1, ln|K|} ≤ ln|K|

e.g. we have ς = 0 for |K| = 1 by choosing K = 0 deterministically. For the non-trivial case |K| > 0, an achievable tradeoff
can be obtained using the random code from [4] below.

Vector model:
The user observes an i.i.d. sequence Zn and the wiretapper
observes (Yn , F) where Yn is another i.i.d. sequence corn
related with Zn according to PYZ and F := θ(Yn , Zn ) is
an arbitrary function taking values over a ﬁnite set F that

grows at rate r := lim supn→∞ n ln|F |. The objective is
to characterize the optimal tradeoff between the key rate

where the random index L is uniformly distributed over L,

P ROOF The ﬁrst inequality is by (9) and the fact that ln|K| is
linear in n and therefore does not contribute to the exponent.
We will evaluate the exponent using the method of types [8]
for the special case Y is deterministic. The general case
follows easily by an additional conditioning on Y.
Recall that the type of z ∈ Z n is the empirical distribution,
say Q, where nQ(α) is the number of α ∈ Z appearing in z.
Denote the set of possible types by Pn (Z) and the set of all
n
z ∈ Z n of the same type Q ∈ Pn (Z) by the type class TQ .
The main results we need from the method of types are

PZ (z) = e−n[D(Q∥PZ )+H(Q)]

∀z ∈ TQ ,

As before, we apply the universal hashing K := θL (G) where
{θl : l ∈ L} is a universal family of functions θl : G → K,
and L is a uniformly random index independent of (Zn , Yn , F).
Although the secrecy exponent can be lower bounded by (13)
with Z replaced by G, a tighter bound may be obtained using
the error exponent ξ as follows.
Lemma 3 For the vector model with restricted key, universal
hashing achieves a secrecy exponent (12) at least the minimum
of ξ in (15) and the R.H.S. of (13).
2
n.b. if ξ is very large, the exponent would be given by (13)
without replacing Z by G. This is potentially larger than the
bound with Z replaced by G since the randomness of G can
be smaller than that of Z.

As in [2], we require all the active users to learn the entire source after public discussion, which is referred to as
communication for omniscience. Each user i ∈ A generates
ˆ
an estimate Zi of Zn as a function of his accumulated
V
observations (LV , Zn , F). If the estimates are correct, then they
i
can compute the secret key correctly since it is a function of
Gn , which in turn, is determined by Zn . The probability of
V
error (3) is therefore upper bounded by the probability of error
in recovering Zn . By the source coding results [9], the error
V
exponent can be no smaller than the random coding exponent

estimate of the virtual user, which can simply be the minentropy decoder [9]. We can apply Lemma 3 with Z = ZV ,
Y = ZD and F replaced by F′ . The error exponent ξ in (15)
is E ′ (u, rV ) in (20), and the R.H.S. of (13) corresponds to
S ′ (u, rV , R) :=

min ΥQZV (B)

QZV ∈P(ZV )

u + r(Dc ) + R ≤ H(PZDc |ZD )

+

ΥQZV (B) := r(B) − H(QZB |ZBc |QZBc )

To lower bound the secrecy exponent, we will introduce a
virtual user and a virtual message to the system. They are
not part of the actual system, however, and are introduced
only for the purpose of computing the bound. After the entire

P ROOF (R, rV ) is strongly achievable because (18), (22) and
(24) for some u ≥ 0 implies that the exponents are positive as
argued before. Consider proving the second implication in the
′
corollary. Suppose rDc is an optimal solution to (26). For δ >

0 sufﬁciently small, we have (26a) even if ri ’s are increased
′
c
by δ. Let u := 0, ri := ri + δ for i ∈ D and ri arbitrarily
large for i ∈ D. Then, (26b), (26c) and (26a) imply (18), (22)
and (24) respectively. Hence, R is strongly achievable.
■
′
(26) can be explained intuitively as follows. rDc can be
interpreted as a discussion rate tuple that satisﬁes the SlepianWolf constraints [8] (26b) and (26c) for the active users
j ∈ A and the virtual user observing G to attain omniscience
of ZV . H(ZDc |ZD ) is the common randomness among the
active users not revealed through ZD while at most r′ (Dc ) of
it is revealed through the public discussion. The remaining
common randomness, i.e. the R.H.S. of in (26a), remains
secret. In particular, the portion of secret randomness in G
can be used for the key. Since the virtual user can recover
ZDc from G, all the randomness in ZDc is in G. Indeed, the
entire secret randomness is the secrecy capacity.

which, in turn, holds if u + r(B) > H(ZB |ZB c G). The
cases where B ̸⊇ A are implied by (18) and u ≥ 0 since

The capacity is a linear program that can be computed in
polynomial time with respect to |V | as shown in [10]. The
capacity in [2] is the special case when G = ZV and the
necessary condition for secure computing in [6] can also be
expressed in terms of this capacity [7].

The admissible restriction in [3] is the special case when
G = Zj for some j ∈ A, in which case (29) follows from
H(G) = H(Zj ) ≥ I(Zj ∧ ZV \{j} ). (29) extends it further to

VI. E XTENSION
We have formulated the problem of secret key agreement
with a restricted key and derived an inner bound to the error
and secrecy exponents by the random coding error exponent
and the privacy ampliﬁcation theorem for universal hashing.
The secrecy capacity is in the form of a polynomial-time
solvable linear program strongly achievable with the key and
public discussion functions restricted to be linear over a ﬁnite
ﬁeld. A restriction on the key is also shown to be admissible
if its randomness remains no smaller than the unrestricted
secrecy capacities when some helpers become untrusted. This
leads to a larger class of admissible restrictions than previously
known without sacriﬁcing strong security.
It is possible improve the secrecy exponent as shown in [1].
e.g. the exponent S ′ (0, rV , R) in (23) larger than the one in
(25) is achievable for the unrestricted case G = ZV because
the virtual user can recover Zn perfectly from Gn without
V
any virtual message, i.e. u = 0. For the more general case, it
is also possible to improve the exponent by the multiterminal
privacy ampliﬁcation theorem in [7] that exploits the additional
fact that the discussion functions are not arbitrary given
functions of certain rates but can be chosen optimally from
some universal families. In particular, the improvement is a
consequence of securing the type information of Zn from the
V
public messages. It would be interesting to see how much
improvement is possible by giving an outer bound on the
achievable rates and exponents.

where rU ≥ 0 means that ri ≥ 0 for all i ∈ U . Cs (U ) can be
interpreted as the unrestricted capacity when U c ⊇ D is the
set of untrusted users. In particular, to see that Cs (Dc ) is the
unrestricted capacity (26a) when G = ZV , n.b. (26c) becomes
r′ (B) ≥ 0 for B ⊆ Dc : B ⊇ A. This holds iff r′ (A) ≥ 0

and ri ≥ 0 for all i ∈ Dc \ A. We have rU ≥ 0 altogether
′
′
since ri ≥ 0 for i ∈ A follows from r (A) ≥ 0 when |A| = 1
and from (26b) when |A| ≥ 2. The following theorem gives a
sufﬁcient condition for G to be admissible in terms on Cs (U ).

Theorem 3 G is admissible if
H(G|ZU c ) ≥ Cs (U )

∀U ⊆ Dc : U ⊇ A,

(28)

i.e. the secrecy capacity (26a) equals Cs (Dc ) in (27a).

c

P ROOF The secrecy capacity (26a) is no larger than Cs (D )
trivially because (26b) is identical to (27b) for U = Dc .
′
Consider proving the reverse inequality. Suppose rDc is an
c
optimal solution to (27a) with U = D , attaining the secrecy
capacity Cs (Dc ). We will show that (26c) holds under (28) and
′
so rDc is feasible to (26a) as desired. Since (27b) for U = Dc ,
′
i.e. (26b), implies (27b) for any U ⊆ Dc : U ⊇ A, rU is a
feasible solution to (27a), i.e. Cs (U ) ≥ H(ZU |ZU c ) − r′ (U ),
which implies by (28) that H(G|ZU c ) ≥ H(ZU |ZU c ) − r′ (U )
and therefore (26c) with U rewritten as B.

In words, G is admissible if its randomness remains no
smaller than the unrestricted capacity when some trusted
helpers in V \ (A ∪ D) becomes untrusted. When all users are
active, i.e. A = Dc = V , (28) simpliﬁes to H(G) ≥ Cs (V ),
which is indeed the counterpart of the sufﬁcient condition
H(G) < Cs (V ) for G to be securely computable in [6].
Corollary 2 G is admissible if it is a function of Zj with
H(G) ≥ I(Zj ∧ ZV \{j} )

(29)

for some j ∈ A with |A| ≥ 2.

P ROOF Consider proving that (28) is satisﬁed by |A| ≥ 2 and
′
(29) for some j ∈ A. For any U ⊆ Dc : U ⊇ A, let rU be the
optimal solution that attains the capacity Cs (U ) in (27a). Since
′
|A| ≥ 2, we have {j} ̸⊇ A and so rj ≥ H(Zj |ZV \{j} ) ≥
H(Zj |G) by (27b) and (29). Similarly, since |U \ {j}| ̸⊇ A,
we also have r′ (U \ {j}) ≥ H(ZU \{j} |ZU c ) by (27b) and the
fact that j ∈ A ⊆ U . Thus,
′
r′ (U ) = rj + r′ (U \ {j}) ≥ H(Zj |G) + H(ZU \{j} |ZU c )
