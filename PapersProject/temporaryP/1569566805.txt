codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld. In this paper, we deﬁne non-binary
LDPC codes over general linear group GL(m3 , F2m4 ) and
give BP decoding algorithm for non-binary LDPC codes over
GL(m3 , F2m4 ) to analyze the non-binary LDPC codes over
both ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m and general linear group GL(m, F2 ). We
assume the q-ary memoryless symmetric (q-MS) channels [6]
for the generality of the channels, where q = 2m1 . We extend
the optimization and analysis method in [5] to the non-binary
LDPC codes over general linear group transmitted over the qMS channel. More precisely, ﬁrst, we derive the condition for
successful decoding of zigzag cycle codes. Next, we propose a
method to lower the decoding error rates in the error ﬂoors for
non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m3 , F2m4 ). Moreover, we
show lower bounds on the symbol error rates in the error ﬂoors
for non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m3 , F2m4 ). Furthermore,
some simulation results show that the lower bounds on symbol
error rates in the error ﬂoors are tight for the optimized nonbinary LDPC codes.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II deﬁnes nonbinary LDPC codes and introduces the q-MS channel. Section
III proposes a method to lower the error ﬂoors by analyzing
the zigzag cycles. Section IV derives lower bounds for symbol
error rates in the error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes. We
omit several proofs in this paper due to space limitation.

Abstract—In this paper, we compare the decoding error rates
in the error ﬂoors for non-binary low-density parity-check
(LDPC) codes over the general linear group with those for
non-binary LDPC codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld transmitted over the
q-ary memoryless symmetric channel under belief propagation
decoding. To analyze non-binary LDPC codes deﬁned over
both general linear group GL(m, F2 ) and ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m , we
investigate non-binary LDPC codes deﬁned over GL(m3 , F2m4 ).
We propose a method to lower the error ﬂoors for non-binary
LDPC codes. In this analysis, we see that the optimized nonbinary LDPC codes deﬁned over general linear group have the
same decoding performance in the error ﬂoors as those deﬁned
over ﬁnite ﬁeld. The non-binary LDPC codes deﬁned over general
linear group have more choices of the labels in the edges which
satisfy the condition for the optimization.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Gallager invented low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes
[1]. Due to the sparseness of the parity check matrices, LDPC
codes are efﬁciently decoded by the belief propagation (BP)
decoder. Optimized LDPC codes can exhibit performance very
close to the Shannon limit [2]. Davey and MacKay [3] have
found that non-binary LDPC codes can outperform binary
ones.
Finite ﬁeld of the order 2m is denoted by F2m . For a nonnegative integer m3 and ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m4 , the set of m3 × m3
×m
invertible matrices over F2m4 , i.e., Fm34 3 , is called general
2m
linear group and denoted by GL(m3 , F2m4 ). It is known
that the decoding complexity of non-binary LDPC codes over
general linear group GL(m, F2 ) is larger than that of nonbinary LDPC codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m for m ≥ 2. On the
other hand, the decoding error rates in the waterfall region
for optimized non-binary LDPC codes over general linear
group is lower than those for optimized non-binary LDPC
codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld [4]. However, no methods to lower the
decoding error rates in error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes
over general linear group have been proposed. Moreover, the
decoding error rates in the error ﬂoor region for optimized
non-binary LDPC codes over general linear group have not
been compared with those for optimized non-binary LDPC
codes over ﬁnite ﬁeld.
In [5], we analyzed the error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC

II. P RELIMINARIES
In this section, we recall the 2m1 -MS channel [6] and deﬁne
the non-binary LDPC codes over GL(m3 , F2m4 ).
A. Non-binary LDPC code over GL(m3 , F2m4 )
For the non-binary LDPC codes, the Tanner graphs are
represented by sparse bipartite graphs with variable nodes,
check nodes and labeled edges. Each labels for the nonbinary LDPC codes over GL(m3 , F2m4 ) is an element in
GL(m3 , F2m4 ). Let N and M be the number of variable nodes
and check nodes, respectively. We denote the label in the edges
adjacent to the v-th variable node and the c-th check node, by
hc,v ∈ GL(m3 , F2m4 ). To simplify the notation, hc,v = 0
if the v-th variable node and the c-th check node are not
connected. Deﬁne [a, b] := {n ∈ N | a ≤ n ≤ b} for the

1

2m
channel output as follows:

integers a, b. Note that [a, b] = ∅ if a > b. For a given Tanner
graph, the code represented by the Tanner graph is given by
N
m3
{(xi )i∈[1,N ] ∈ (Fm34 )N |
2m
i=1 hj,i xi = 0 ∈ F2m4 , j ∈
[1, M ]}, where (xi )i∈[1,N ] represents the vector (x1 , . . . , xN ).
Since the non-binary LDPC codes over Fm = GL(1, F2m )
and over GL(m, F2 ) are special case for the non-binary LDPC
codes over GL(m3 , F2m4 ), we refer the non-binary LDPC
codes over GL(m3 , F2m4 ) as generalized non-binary LDPC
codes.
In this paper, we consider the q-MS channel, where q =
2m1 . For the 2m1 -ary channel, the number of input alphabet X
is 2m1 . We assume X = Fm1 . Let Y be a given continuous (or
2
discrete) alphabet. We denote the channel transition probability
by p(y | x), where x ∈ X and y ∈ Y. The q-ary memoryless
channel is symmetric if there exists a function T : Y ×X → Y
satisﬁed the following properties:
1) For all x ∈ X , the function T (·, x) : Y → Y is bijective.
2) For all x1 , x2 ∈ X and y ∈ Y, p(y | x1 ) = p(T (y, x2 −
x1 ) | x2 ) holds.
3) For channels whose output alphabet Y is continuous, the
mapping T is that its Jacobian is equal to 1.
In the case for m1 = 1, 2m1 -MS channel represents memoryless binary input output symmetric channel.
Let α be a primitive element F2m4 . Once a primitive
element of α is ﬁxed, each element in F2m4 is given by
an m4 -bit representation [7, p. 110]. Hence, γ ∈ Fm34 is
2m
represented by m3 m4 bits as (γi )i∈[1,m3 m4 ] . Let (xi )i∈[1,N ] ∈
(Fm34 )N denote a codeword of a non-binary LDPC code.
2m
The codeword (xi )i∈[1,N ] is represented as a binary codeword
(xi,j )i∈[1,N ],j∈[1,m3 m4 ] . We assume m1 | m3 m4 and denote
m2 = m3 m4 /m1 . Then, a symbol xi ∈ GL(m3 , F2m4 )
is represented as m2 channel inputs to 2m1 -MS channel.
For a given codeword, we denote the channel outputs by
(yi,j )i∈[1,N ],j∈[1,m2 ] ∈ Y N m2 .
Example 1: The 2m1 -ary symmetric channel (2m1 -SC) is an
example of the 2m1 -MS channel. For the 2m1 -SC, the output
alphabet is Y = 2m1 and transition probability function is

deﬁned by the fraction of the symbol which is not eventually
correct.
The following lemma shows that all-zero codeword assumption holds for non-binary LDPC code over GL(m3 , F2m4 )
transmitted over the 2m1 -MS channel under BP decoding.

III. Z IGZAG C YCLE C ODE A NALYSIS
A zigzag cycle is a circuit [9] such that the degrees of all
the variable nodes in the circuit are two. A zigzag cycle of
weight w consists of w variable nodes of degree two. The
zigzag cycle code is deﬁned by a Tanner graph which forms
a single zigzag cycle. Figure 1 shows a zigzag cycle code of
symbol code length w. In this section, we give a condition
for successful decoding of the zigzag cycle codes over the
2m1 -MS channels under BP decoding.
We consider the zigzag cycle code of symbol code length
w with labels h1,1 , h1,2 , . . . , hw,w , hw,1 ∈ GL(m3 , F2m4 ) as
shown in Fig. 1. We deﬁne χ := h−1 h1,2 · · · h−1 hw,1 .

Deﬁnition 1: Let χ be the cyclic subgroup generated by
χ, i.e., χ := {χj | j = 0, 1, 2, . . . }. The relation ∼ on
Fm34 deﬁned by x ∼ y is an equivalence relation on Fm34 ,
2m
2m
if and only if there exists g ∈ χ such that gx = y. The
equivalence class of x ∈ Fm34 under this relation is χ x =
2m
{gx | g ∈ χ }, and is called the orbit of x under χ . The
set of orbits of x ∈ Fm34 \ {0} under χ forms a partition of

one of equivalence classes. A set of class representatives Sχ

For any m3 × m3 matrices A1 , A2 , . . . , Ak , we deﬁne

the decoding error rates depend on a set of class representatives

and weight of zigzag cycle code.
Theorem 1: We consider a zigzag cycle code of symbol code length w labeled by h1,1 , h1,2 , . . . , hw,w , hw,1 ∈
GL(m3 , F2m4 ) transmitted over the 2m1 -MS channel. Let
ιi := h−1 hi,i+1 for i ∈ [1, w], where hw+1,w := h1,w . The

By Using Theorem 1, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 1: Deﬁne Sχ as in Deﬁnition 1. For a given
channel output, if the zigzag cycle with the matrix χ such
that |Sχ | > 1 is successfully decoded, the zigzag cycle with
the matrix χ such that |Sχ | = 1 is also successfully decoded.
Corollary 1 shows a condition for lowering the error ﬂoor.
The following lemma asserts that the condition for successful
˜
decoding in the case for |Sχ | = 1 is simpliﬁed by the order
of the matrix χ.
Lemma 2: The order of the matrix χ is 2m3 m4 − 1 if and
˜
only if |Sχ | = 1.
We use the following lemma in order to prove Lemma 2.
Lemma 3: The characteristic polynomial fχ (x) of the matrix χ ∈ GL(m3 , F2m4 ) is deﬁned by det(xI − χ) with I
being m3 × m3 identity matrix over F2m4 . For polynomials
f (x) over F2m4 such that f (0) = 0, the least positive integer e
for which f (x) divides xe −1 is called the order of polynomial
f (x) and is denoted by ord(f ). If the order σχ of the matrix
χ is 2m3 m4 −1 , then the order ord(fχ ) of the characteristic
polynomial fχ (x) is also 2m3 m4 −1 .
Proof: Since χ is m3 ×m3 nonsingular matrix, fχ (0) = 0.
By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, fχ (χ) = 0. The deﬁnition of the order ord(fχ ) of polynomial fχ gives fχ (x) |
xord(fχ ) − 1. Since fχ (χ) | χord(fχ ) − 1 and fχ (χ) = 0, we
have χord(fχ ) − 1 = 0. Hence, we get σχ | ord(fχ ). Since
ord(fχ ) ≤ 2m3 m4 − 1 by [10, Corollary 3.4], ord(fχ ) =
2m3 m4 − 1 if σχ = 2m3 m4 − 1.
This lemma gives the proof of Lemma 2 as follows.

Proof: Denote m = m3 m4 . Firstly, we assume |Sχ | = 1.

This equation asserts that χi = χj for all i, j ∈ [0, 2m − 2]

with i = j. Hence, χi = χj for all i, j ∈ [0, 2m − 2] with
i = j. Thus, the order of χ is equal to or greater than 2m − 1.
For all χ ∈ GL(m3 , F2m4 ), the order of χ is equal to or lower
than 2m − 1, i.e., σχ ≤ 2m − 1 [11, Corollary 2]. Therefore,
˜
σχ = 2m − 1 if |Sχ | = 1.
Secondly, we assume σχ = 2m−1 . By Lemma 3, the
order of characteristic polynomial fχ (x) is 2m − 1. Since
ord(fχ ) = 2m − 1, f (0) = 0 and f (x) is monic polynomial
[10, Deﬁnition 1.49], the characteristic polynomial fχ (x) is
a primitive polynomial [10, Theorem 3.16]. Hence, the ﬁeld
F2m is represented in {0} ∪ {χi | i ∈ [0, 2m − 2]}. Thus, for
all i, j ∈ [0, 2m − 2] with i = j, there exists a k ∈ [0, 2m − 2]
such that χi + χj = χk . This implies that χi = χj for all

Discussion 1: By combining Corollary 1 and Lemma 2, we
see that the zigzag cycles with the matrix χ such that the
order of χ is 2m3 m4 − 1 have the best decoding performance.
By using this condition, we propose a method to lower the
error ﬂoors for generalized non-binary LDPC codes as follows:
Designing the labels in the zigzag cycles of small weight as
the order of χ satisfy 2m3 m4 − 1.
The log-likelihood ratio for 2m1 -ary channels are deﬁned in
[12]. For γ ∈ Fm1 , let Zv,i (Yv,i , γ) denote the log-likelihood
2
ratio corresponding to the i-th channel output yv,i in the v-th
variable node, i.e.,
Zv,i (yv,i , γ) := log

p(yv,i | 0)

Corollary 3 shows that for a ﬁxed weight w and m =
m3 m4 , the decoding error rate of the zigzag cycle code does
not depend on m3 or m4 . In other words, the decoding error
rate of the zigzag cycle over general linear group is equal to
that of the zigzag cycle over ﬁnite ﬁeld for a ﬁxed weight w
and m = m3 m4 .

By using the log-likelihood ratio, the following corollary
gives the condition for successful decoding of the zigzag cycle
codes with the matrix χ of the order 2m3 m4 − 1 over the 2m1 ary input memoryless symmetric channel.
Corollary 2: We consider the zigzag cycle codes of symbol
code length w with the matrix χ of the order 2m3 m4 − 1
over the 2m1 -ary input memoryless symmetric channel. For

IV. A NALYSIS OF E RROR F LOORS
In the previous section, we give a condition for the decoding
error to the zigzag cycle code. By using this result, in this
section, we give lower bounds of the symbol error rates in
the error ﬂoors of non-binary LDPC code ensembles over the
2m1 -MS channel under BP decoding.
Deﬁnition 3: Let LDPC(N, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), λ, ρ) denote
LDPC code ensemble of symbol code length N over
GL(m3 , F2m4 ) deﬁned by Tanner graphs with a degree distribution pair (λ, ρ) [13] and labels of edges chosen elements from GL(m3 , F2m4 ) with equal probability. Let wg ∈
N be an expurgation parameter. The expurgated ensemble
ELDPC(N, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), λ, ρ, wg ) consists of the subset
of codes in LDPC(N, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), λ, ρ) which contain
no stopping sets of weight in [1, wg − 1]. Let wc ∈
N be an expurgation parameter for labeling in the Tanner graph, where wg ≤ wc . Deﬁne expurgated ensemble
ELDPC(N, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), λ, ρ, wg , wc , H) as the subset of
codes in ELDPC(N, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), λ, ρ, wg ) which contain
no zigzag cycles of weight in [wg , wc − 1] with β ∈ H.

Let a denote the conditional probability density function of the
random variable L(Y ) given that the corresponding channel
input is zero. We refer the function a as L-density. Note that
in the case for the memoryless binary-input output-symmetric
channels, i.e., m1 = 1, L-density deﬁned in the above gives
the deﬁnition of the L-density in [13, p. 178].
Deﬁnition 2: For a L-density a, the Bhattacharyya func∞
tional B(a) is deﬁned as B(a) := −∞ a(x) exp[−x/2]dx.
In this deﬁnition, we assume not only symmetric L-density
[13] but also asymmetric L-density. The following facts show
the properties of the Bhattacharyya functional.
Fact 1: For L-density a1 and a2 , B(a1 ∗ a2 ) =
B(a1 )B(a2 ) holds, where ∗ denotes the convolution, i.e.,
∞
(a1 ∗ a2 )(x) := −∞ a1 (x − y)a2 (y)dy.
Fact 2: Let Z denote the random variable with L-density
a. Then, Pr(Z ≤ 0) ≤ B(a).
Fact 1, 2 and Corollary 2 give the decoding error probability
of zigzag cycle with the matrix χ of the order σχ as the
following corollary.
Corollary 3: Denote m = m3 m4 . Let Pzz (w, m, a) be the
symbol error rate for the zigzag cycle codes deﬁned over
GL(m3 , F2m4 ) of symbol code length w with the matrix χ

∗
Hm3 ,m4 := {χ ∈ GL(m3 , F2m4 ) | σχ < 2m3 m4 − 1}.

From Discussion 1, to lower the error ﬂoors, we need to avoid
∗
the zigzag cycle with the matrix χ ∈ Hm3 ,m4 .
A. Analysis of Error Floors
In this section, we analyze the symbol error rates in the error
ﬂoors for the expurgated ensembles deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.
The following theorem gives a lower bound on the symbol
error rate under BP decoding for the expurgated ensemble
∗
ELDPC(N, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), λ, ρ, wg , wc , Hm3 ,m4 ).
Theorem 2: Let Ps (ELDPC, a) be the symbol error rate
of the expurgated ensemble ELDPC(N, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), λ, ρ,

its L-density a under BP decoding. Denote m = m3 m4 .

From Figure 2 and 3, we see that the proposed codes exhibit
better decoding performance than non-optimized code. The
lower bound (2) gives tight lower bounds for the symbol
error rates to the proposed codes. Moreover, we see that the
decoding performance in the error ﬂoors for optimized codes
depend only on the size of m3 m4 .

We prove the relation between the orbit and the order of
general linear group. In this paper, we propose a method to
lower the error ﬂoors for non-binary LDPC codes. In this
analysis, we see that the optimized non-binary LDPC codes
deﬁned over general linear group exhibits have the same
decoding performance in the error ﬂoors as those deﬁned over
ﬁnite ﬁeld. The non-binary LDPC codes deﬁned over general
linear group have more choices of the labels in the edges which
satisfy the condition for the optimization.

This theorem derived from Corollary 3. For a given channel
and a ﬁxed µ, m, the decoding error rate for the non-binary
LDPC code over ﬁnite ﬁeld F2m is same as that for the nonbinary LDPC code over GL(m3 , F2m4 ) such that m = m3 m4 .
B. Simulation Results
In this section, we compare the symbol error rate in the error
ﬂoor for the expurgated ensemble constructed by our proposed
method with that for non-optimized ensemble.

ensemble transmitted over the binary additive white Gaussian
noise channel ELDPC(315, GL(m3 , F2m4 ), x, x2 , 1, 8, H) for
