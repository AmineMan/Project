of direct links between the two users. Compared with [7],
our contribution is to present QF-based protocols that do
not suffer from the delay and complexity inherent in NNC
decoding. We compare the performance of our new schemes
with existing CF-based coding techniques. The two approaches
are distinguished by their decoding protocols: one protocol
uses (forward) sliding window decoding while the other uses
block-by-block backward decoding. The latter scheme incurs
longer decoding delay but potentially achieves higher rates.
The goals of this paper are twofold: First, as mentioned, we
aim to develop relaying schemes which do not require joint
decoding over multiple blocks, thereby reducing complexity
and delay, while still achieving comparable performance as in
the case of layered NNC and outperforming other CF-based
schemes. Second, we emphasize the beneﬁts of not using W-Z
binning, and of layering in relay networks wherein a relay has
to serve different nodes. We illustrate our coding strategy for
the two-way relay channel but the idea is applicable for other
relay networks such as interference-relay networks [8].
Notation: We use the standard notation in [9].

Abstract—This paper proposes two new coding schemes for
the discrete memoryless two-way relay channel. The main target
is to show the beneﬁts of compress-forward without Wyner-Ziv
binning and of layered relaying in networks wherein a relay is to
help multiple destinations, that may have unequal channel quality
and/or have access to different side information. Numerical
results for a Gaussian channel show that the new coding schemes
outperform variants of compress-forward relaying and offer a
good trade-off between achievable rates and complexity and
decoding delay. The idea can also be applied to other relay
networks.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Ever since the seminal paper on the classical 3-node relay channel by Cover and El Gamal [1], research on relay
networks has presented numerous coding strategies. A considerable part of those strategies employ compress-forward (CF)
techniques. The classical CF [1] approach uses Wyner-Ziv (WZ) source coding to convey the compression index from the
relay to the destination, thereby helping the recovery of the
desired message. In [2] Avestimehr et al. proposed a quantizemap-forward (QMF) relaying scheme, which does not employ
W-Z binning, and showed that QMF can achieve the capacity
region of the Gaussian relay network within a constant gap. In
parallel work, Lim et al. proposed the notion of noisy network
coding (NNC) [3], which generalizes and uniﬁes network
coding and CF without W-Z binning. NNC has been shown
to outperform classical CF [1] and some of CF’s extensions
for certain channels [3]. NNC, however, incurs long decoding
delay due to the necessity of joint decoding over multiple
blocks. A different relaying scheme, which is based on CF
without W-Z binning and with sliding window decoding, was
recently proposed by Kramer and Hou [4] and Zhong and
Vu [5]. It is worth to emphasize that all different types of
CF-based relaying above give the same performance for the
3-node relay channel [3], [4]. The difference in performance
appears only in more general relay networks [3]. In such multinode relay networks, it is common that a relay is to help
multiple receiving nodes which may have unequal channel
quality. For such a scenario G¨ nd¨ z et al. [6] proposed a
u u
layered CF scheme for the two-way relay channel, in the
absence of direct links, and Lim et al. extend their approach
to a layered NNC protocol [7] (LNNC). In this paper we
propose two layered schemes for the two-way relay channel.
In contrast to [6], we use only quantize-and-forward (QF), i.e.,
no W-Z binning, and we also take into account the presence

II. M AIN R ESULTS
Consider the two-way relay channel (TWRC), which is
modeled as a network of 3 nodes. Node 1 and node 2 wish to
exchange their messages m1 and m2 with the help of node 3
(the relay). The channel is memoryless and time invariant in
the sense that
i−1 i−1 i−1
p(y1i , y2i , y3i |m1 , m2 , xi , xi , xi , y1 , y2 , y3 )
1
2
3

= pY1 ,Y2 ,Y3 |X1 ,X2 ,X3 (y1i , y2i , y3i |x1i , x2i , x3i )
for all i. Therefore we can focus on the conditional probability
mass function (p.m.f.) p(y1 , y2 , y3 |x1 , x2 , x3 ). xk is drawn
from a ﬁnite alphabet Xk , k ∈ [1 : 3]. In order to improve
the performance when channel quality at node 1 and 2 are
asymmetric, the relay in this paper quantizes its observation
into two layers and forwards the quantization indices by two
layers of codewords, without binning. Unlike in NNC where
the decoders decode over multiple blocks, the decoders in our
scheme decode block by block, either forward or backward,
thereby reducing decoding complexity and/or decoding delay.
The main results of this paper are Theorems 1 and 2, corresponding to (forward) sliding window decoding and backward
decoding, respectively.

Remark 2: If we ignore (14)–(16) then the description of
the achievable region RBW is identical to the rate region

achieved by layered NNC [7]. This means that if the ratemaximizing joint distribution for the layered NNC satisﬁes (14)–(16) then the layered quantize-forward with backward decoding achieves the same rate region as layered NNC.
We refer to Section IV for numerical examples.
For a particular joint distribution we see that the right hand
sides of (9), (14) and (16) are larger than or equal to those
of (1), (6), and (8). Thus we can conclude that RF W ⊆ RBW ,

sliding window decoding. The trade-off is longer decoding
delay, see also numerical results in Section IV.

large b. The message m1 of 2nbR1 bits is split into b blocks
m1,1 , m1,2 , . . . , m1,b of 2nR1 bits each. In block j ∈ [1 : b+1]
node 1 transmits x1j (m1,j ), where m1,b+1 = 1. Similarly for

where (l0 , t0 ) = (1, 1) by convention. If there are more than
one such index pair, select one of them uniformly at random. If
there is no such index pair, select an arbitrary pair at random.
The relay node transmits x3,j+1 (lj |kj ) in block j + 1.
Decoding: Let ǫ > ǫ′ . The decoders at node 1 and
2 use sliding window decoding as follows. As usual for
block Markov coding [1], assuming that node 1 has decoded
kj−1 correctly in block j. At the end of block j + 1,

Error analysis: Here we do error analysis for decoder 2.
Let (M1,j , M2,j , M1,j+1 , M2,j+1 ) denote the message indices
chosen by the transmitters and (Kj−1 , Lj−1 ) denote the indices chosen by the relay at the corresponding blocks. Due
to the symmetry of codebook generation, sub-codebooks with
respect to (lj−1 , kj−1 ) have the same distribution. Therefore,
we can equivalently assume Lj−1 = Kj−1 = 1 and M1,j =
M2,j = M1,j+1 = M2,j+1 = 1 for the analysis, cf. [9,
Appendix 11A]. First note that the joint typicality check at
the relay fails if the following event occurs:
E1j =

P (E1,j+1 (lj , kj ) ∩ E2,j (m1,j , lj , kj ))

due to the fact that the codebooks in different blocks are
generated independently and channel is memoryless. For

i=1 pV,X3 x3(j+1),i (lj |kj ), vj+1,i (kj )

The encoding and decoding processes are depicted in Table II.
The key difference between backward decoding and sliding
window decoding is that for backward decoding the joint
typicality check at each decoder only involves codewords
belonging to the same block. This leads to less restrictive
conditions for the probability of error to vanish as compared
with sliding window decoding, thereby leading to potentially
higher rates. The error analysis follows similar procedures as
in Section III-A. Details are omitted due to space constraint.

The union of events bound guarantees that the error probability
at decoder 2 vanishes as n → ∞ if (27)–(31) are satisﬁed.
Similarly we can show that the error probability at decoder
1 vanishes as n → ∞ if

network coding. The results in this paper also conﬁrm the
advantage of not using Wyner-Ziv binning in networks that are
more complex than the classical relay channel [1]. To further
improve the performance one can combine our protocols with
partial decode-forward or hybrid relaying [13], [14].

by compress-forward [11], [12], compress-forward without
Wyner-Ziv binning [5], noisy network coding [3], and layered
noisy network coding [7], respectively. LQF-BW and LQFBW denotes our schemes in Theorem 1 and 2, and LCF
denotes the layered CF [6] for channel without direct links.
Fig. 1 shows achievable sum rates for the Gaussian TWRC
with direct links. We see that LQF with sliding window
decoding outperforms CF, CF without binning (which equals
NNC), and meets layered NNC in certain regimes (with lower
delay and decoding complexity). With the same decoding
delay but less complexity, LQF with backward decoding meets
the layered NNC in a large part of channel gains. We also
notice the considerable gain due to layering in this case: the
gap between our schemes and other non-layering schemes
are most prominent when the channels from the relay to the
receivers are asymmetric (when d is close to 0). It shows that
layering can be very helpful, especially when the channel gains
are considerably distinct. In that case a simple layering scheme
outperforms even the noisy network coding without layering.
Fig. 2 shows numerical simulations for the Gaussian TWRC
without direct links. For this channel we observe that both LQF
with sliding window decoding and with backward decoding
achieve the same sum rate as LNNC and outperform all
other variants of compress/quantize-forward. Also note that
the layered CF scheme proposed in [6] only performs equally
to the classical CF scheme in this case.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
We proposed two novel relay schemes, which are particularly useful when a relay node serves multiple receiving
nodes. The proposed schemes show promising gains compared
to non-layering schemes while not suffering from the high
complexity and decoding delay of the schemes based on noisy
