Abstract—In this paper we derive the sum-capacity of 3-user
linear deterministic interference channels (LDIC) under certain
connectivity assumptions with symmetric parameters. The results
also directly yield the sum-capacity of a 3-user fully-connected
LDIC with symmetric parameters. We further illustrate with
an example the potential difﬁculties in extending the results to
asymmetric cases.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Linear deterministic models [3] enable a simpliﬁed, high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis of certain network information theory problems like the interference channel or the
relay channel, where the exact solution to the Gaussian model
might be elusive. Further, the linear deterministic solution can
motivate schemes in the corresponding Gaussian case that
are approximately capacity achieving. The 2-user Gaussian
interference channel (IC), where the capacity region is now
known within 1 bit [4], has largely beneﬁtted from linear
deterministic insights [6]. The extension of this result to 3
and then to a general K-user interference channel has proven
to be ardous. This is due in part to the following reasons:
• The optimality of Han-Kobayashi schemes [1] as shown
in the 2-user case does not carry over to the 3-user setting
[8].
• Integrating the idea of interference alignment [7] with
random codes is complex.
• The analysis is highly cluttered by system parameters
which are exponential in the number of users.
In a K-user linear deterministic IC (LDIC) the ﬁrst two
obstacles are sometimes circumvented by explicit construction
of coding schemes. Indeed for a number of cases, explicit
capacity achieving schemes have been constructed that involve
either sending uncoded bits or doing simple repetition coding
over a single time-instant [6]. But still, there is considerable
difﬁculty in ﬁnding matching upperbounds out of the many
possible combinations of side-information that can be provided
to each receiver. One way to reduce this complexity is to
consider fully or partly symmetric settings in which the K 2
dimensional parameter space is signiﬁcantly reduced to make
it tractable. A related approach is to look at interference
networks with reduced connectivity such that the total number
of interfering links are limited.
The K-user many-to-one (Fig. 1(a)) and one-to-many
(Fig. 1(b)) LDICs were considered in [5], where K − 1 users

interfere with only one user and one user causes interference
to all other K − 1 users, respectively. Clearly, in this case, the
number of interfering links have been reduced from K(K −1)
to just K − 1. Interference channels with other combinations
of reduced connectivity have been considered in the works of
[11]–[14] (see Fig. 1(c)-(e)).
In this paper, we ﬁrst consider two more ‘reduced link’ 3user interference channels which we call the Crown A (CA)
and Crown B (CB) channels as illustrated in Fig. 1(f)-(g).1
In each of these, users 1 and 3 interfere with each other. In
CA both users 1 and 3 also interfere with user 2; in CB,
user 2 interferes with both 1 and 3. We derive the sum-capacity
of these two channels in a symmetric parameter setting. The
analysis leads to a similar characterization of the sum-capacity
of a 3-user fully-connected LDIC with symmetric parameters,
shown in Fig. 1(h). Two important observations are made in
this context:
•

•

The achievable schemes require use of codes that span at
least 2 time instants, whereas, in all previously considered
reduced link K-user LDICs, coding over a single time
instant was shown to be sufﬁcient.
For the CA channel in a very weak interference case, the
strategy of treating interference as noise is not optimal,

1 The interference connectivities make the channels look like crowns when
viewed sideways. Hence the names.

The interference terms, denoted by the V ’s are in turn given by
the deterministic functions g’s and h’s as shown in Fig. 2. As
in [2], we assume that the functions fi (Xi , Vi ) are such that
given Yi and Xi , Vi can be determined. From this it follows
that for any product distribution on (Xi )3 we have:
i=1
H(Y1 |X1 ) = H(V13 ) = H(g13 (X3 )),
H(Y3 |X3 ) = H(V31 ) = H(g31 (X1 )),
H(Y2 |X2 ) = H(V2 ) = H(h2 (g21 (X1 ), g23 (X3 ))).

contrasting with the 2-user interference channel as well
some K > 2 user Gaussian interference channels [9].
We also note that the achievable rates in the fully-connected
3-user case corroborate the generalized degrees of freedom
(GDoF) ﬁndings of [10].
In all these cases, tight upperbounds are derived from the
component 2-user ICs and the 2-user Z channels embedded in
the 3-user ICs. Next we look at a speciﬁc example of a 3-user
LDIC with compeletely asymmetric parameters. We show for
this example that upperbounds derived from the component
2-user interference channels are not tight. An explicit 3user upperbound is derived and its tightness is demonstrated
through a simple achievable scheme.
II. C ROWN LDIC S
Consider the 3-user CA channel as shown in Fig. 1(f), where
there are nd “direct levels” for each user and nc “cross levels”
between any two interfering users.2 Let us deﬁne the coupling
nc
parameter α := nd . The sum-capacity of the symmetric crown
channels will be described in separate regimes parameterized
by α.
A. Model
Let us ﬁrst consider a general deterministic version of the
crown channels as shown in Fig. 2. This model is a natural
extension of the 2-user channel considered in [2] and the
linear deterministic models can be obtained as a special case.
Here, we have three independent and uniformly distributed
sources, one at each sender. The source at sender i ∈ {1, 2, 3}
produces an integer message Wi ∈ Mi = {1, · · · , Mi },
n
which is mapped into codeword Xi = (Xi1 , · · · Xin ) by
encoder i. The interference channel comprises of 3 ﬁnite
alphabets Xi = {1, · · · , Ai }, corresponding to the transmitted
symbols of user i, and 3 ﬁnite alphabets Yi = {1, · · · , Bi },
corresponding to the received symbols at decoder i. At each
time-step, the received symbol, Yi at each user i, is given by a
deterministic function fi of that user’s transmitted symbol Xi
and the received interference. Speciﬁcally, for the CA channel,
we have:
Y1 = f1 (X1 , V13 ), Y2 = f2 (X2 , V2 ), Y3 = f3 (X3 , V31 ). (1)
2 In the LDIC, the transmitted signal of each user is a binary vector; here,
a level refers to an entry in this vector.

More details about this kind of model can be found in [11].
An (M1 , M2 , M3 , n, λn ) code for this channel is a set
n
of three encoding functions ei : Mi → Xi , i ∈
{1, 2, 3} and three decoding functions di : Yin →
Mi , i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, with corresponding error probabilities

k=1 wk }, i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and maximum probability of error
λn ≡ maxi pn . A rate-tuple (R1 , R2 , R3 ) is said to be
e,i
achievable if there is a sequence of (2nR1 , 2nR2 , 2nR3 , n, λn )
codes with λn → 0 as n → ∞. The capacity region of this
channel is the closure of the set of all achievable rate tuples.
The sum capacity is given by max(R1 + R2 + R3 ), where
(R1 , R2 , R3 ) is achievable. A similar set of deﬁnitions hold
for the CB channel.
B. Upperbounds
For the CA channel, consider only users 1 and 2 separately,
ignoring user 3. What is left is a Z interference channel whose
sum-rate upperbound is readily obtained from [2] as
R1 + R2 ≤ I(X1 ; Y1 |V21 ) + H(Y2 )

(3)

where the RHS is to be maximized over all product distributions of X1 , X2 . When specialized to the linear deterministic
model, the uniform distribution over X1 and X2 maximizes
the upperbound, and for the symmetric case, the bound can
be written as
R1 + R2 ≤ max(2nd − nc , nc ).

(4)

Similarly, considering only users 3 and 2, we have
R3 + R2 ≤ max(2nd − nc , nc ).

(5)

Now, considering only users 1 and 3, the bounds for 2-user
symmetric LDIC [6] apply, giving
R1 + R3 ≤min(max(2(nd − nc ), 2nc ),
(nd − nc )+ + max(nd , nc )).

(6)

Now consider the entire CA channel in the symmetric case
where all the users are present. The upperbounds given by
(4),(5) and (6) must also hold in this case, as well as any
convex combination, since introducing extra interference can

transmission while the unshaded regions are the levels that remain silent

only decrease the achievable rate. This leads us to the following upperbounds for the symmetric CA LDIC:

Note the discontinuity at α = 1 (also observed in [10]). When
α = 1, the direct signal and the interfering signal(s) at each
receiver is received at the same power level. So, in the case
of CA channel, if receiver 2 can decode the message of transmitter 2, then it can also decode the messages of transmitter
1 and 3. This means, if R2 > 0, then R1 + R2 + R3 ≤ nd .
Further, similar conditions at receivers 1 and 3 ensure that if
R1 > 0 or R3 > 0, then R1 + R3 ≤ nd . It is then straight
forward to see that R1 + R2 + R3 ≤ nd . A similar analysis
leads to the same upperbound as in (7) for the fully-symmetric
CB channel.
C. Achievable Schemes
In this section we describe constructive achievable schemes
for different regimes, depending on the value of α.
1) 0 ≤ α ≤ 1/2: For CA, let user 2 transmit independent
bits from all its nd direct levels. Users 1 and 3 transmit bits
from the bottom (nd −nc ) levels so as not cause interference to
each other, as well as to user 2. The total achievable sum-rate
is then 3nd − 2nc which matches the upperbound. Note that a
scheme that treats interference as noise would not be optimal
in this channel. For CB, we again let user 2 transmit from all
its nd direct levels. Note here that user 2 does not need to
worry about any interference from users 1 and 3. Users 1 and
3 transmit from the top nd − nc levels which are interference
free. This gives the same achievable rate of 3nd − 2nc as in
the CA channel.

2) 1/2 ≤ α ≤ 2/3: The schemes are illustrated in Fig. 3.
For both CA and CB channels, we allow user 2 to transmit
from the top nd −nc and the bottom nd −nc levels but transmit
nothing from the middle levels. In case of CA, we need to
control the transmissions of users 1 and 3 such that they do
not cause any interference to user 2 at the levels where it
is transmitting. This is achieved by mandating users 1 and 3
to use their top 2nc − nd and the bottom nd − nc levels to
transmit independent bits while remaining silent at the middle
levels. Note that, the interference caused by user 1 at user
3 and vice-versa is contained at the levels where the others
are not transmitting. The sum-rate thus obtained is 2(nd −
nc ) + 2((2nc − nd) + (nd − nc )) = 2nd , which is equal to the
upperbound in this regime. In the CB channel, user 2 causes
interference to users 1 and 3. So if these users each transmit
independent bits from the top nd −nc and the bottom 2nc −nd
levels then the interference due to user 2 does not affect them.
Further, the mutual interference between these users is also
contained in the levels where they are not transmitting any
bits. The sum-rate obtained is again 2nd .
3) 2/3 ≤ α < 1: In this regime, the sum-rate upperbound
is 3(1 − α )nd . We show that the same achievable scheme
2
works for both CA and CB channels. Further, in this regime,
we may need to use coding over time.
Deﬁne E(k) = (1 − (2k + 1)(1 − α))nd , where k > 0
2
is an integer. Note that for α ≥ 3 , E(1) ≥ 0 and E(k) is
∗
decreasing. Let k the maximum value of k such that E ≥ 0.
a) Case 1: Suppose E(k ∗ ) = 0. In this case our achievable scheme will require use of only one time unit. At each
transmitter, break up the top levels into k ∗ segments of size
2(1−α)nd . From each such segment, transmit independent bits
from the ﬁrst (1−α)nd levels while transmitting nothing from
the next (1 − α)nd levels. Using the deﬁnition of E(k ∗ ) it can
be seen that this leaves E(k ∗ )+(1−α)nd = (1−α)nd bottom
levels for each user. Transmitting independent bits from these
use up all nd levels of each user. Further, the interference
at each receiver is aligned to those levels where there is no
transmission as shown in Fig. 4 for the CA channel. Because

use of two different shades in transmission is to illustrate where indpendent
bits are transmitted in the two time instants. At the receiving side, the dark
regions are where direct levels transmitting bits actually get interfered.

of the symmetry in the transmission scheme, the same strategy
works both the crown channels, as it does not matter whether
user 2 is getting interference from both users 1 and 3 or
is causing interference to them. Since E(k ∗ ) = 0, we have
nd = (2k ∗ + 1)(nd − nc ). Each user, out of its nd levels,
is using (k ∗ + 1)(nd − nc ) = (k ∗ + 1)(1 − α)nd levels
to transmit independent bits. E(k ∗ ) = 0 also implies that
nc
2k∗
2−α
α = nd = 2k∗ +1 so that (k ∗ + 1) = 2(1−α) . Hence, each
user achieves a rate of 2−α nd , meeting the sum-rate bound of
2
3(1 − α )nd .
2
b) Case 2: Here E(k ∗ ) > 0 and we use 2 units of time to
devise the achievable scheme. In the ﬁrst time instant (t = 0),
we use the same strategy as in case 1 for the top 2k ∗ (1−α)nd
levels and the bottom (1 − α)nd levels. This leaves E(k ∗ )
additional levels where we transmit E(k ∗ ) uncoded bits. These
uncoded bits are received without interference at each desired
receiver but cause interference with some of the bottom levels
at other receivers. To alleviate this, in the next time instant
(t = 1), we leave these additional E(k ∗ ) levels silent and
retransmit the previous time’s E(k ∗ ) interfering bits from the
lowest (1 − α)nd segment of the top levels. Independent bits
are sent as before from the remaining levels. The retransmitted
bits can be used by the other receivers to remove interference
in t = 0. The scheme is shown in Fig. 5, again for the CA
channel, but it works for the CB channel as well. An important
observation is that, whenever two interferers align, we need
to decode only the sum of the interfering signals and not the
individual signals. The number of transmitted independent bits
in 2 time slots by each transmitter is γ = (k ∗ + 1)(nd − nc ) +
E(k ∗ ) + (k ∗ + 1)(nd − nc ), so that a sum-rate of 3(1 − α )nd
2
is obtained.
4) α = 1: Allowing only one of the transmitters to transmit
independent bits using all the available nd level achieves the
sum-capacity in this regime.
5) 1 < α ≤ 4/3: The achievable scheme in this regime
closely resembles the one in 2/3 ≤ α < 1. The details are

4

omitted.
6) 4/3 ≤ α ≤ 3/2: In this regime also we need to use two
time instants to show achievablity. Note that in this regime,
1−2(α −1) ≥ 0 but 1−3(α −1) ≤ 0. In the ﬁrst time instant,
use the top (α − 1)nd levels and the bottom (α − 1)nd levels
to transmit independent bits. However, due to interference, not
all of these bits can be decoded at the receivers. In fact, all the
lower (α − 1)nd bits are received interference-free but (2(α −
1)−(1−(α−1)))nd = (3α−4)nd bits of the top (α−1)nd bits
are received in interference. In the second time instant, out of
the top (α−1)nd levels, transmit (1−2(α−1))nd independent
bits from the top most levels and use the remaining (3α−4)nd
levels to re-transmit the bits that had caused interference in
the ﬁrst time instant. Also, transmit independent bits from the
lowermost (α − 1)nd levels and nothing from the rest. Thus
in 2 time instants, the total number of bits transmitted by each
user is 2(α − 1)nd + (1 − 2(α − 1)nd + (α − 1)nd ) = αnd ,
3
so that the sum-rate obtained from this scheme is 2 αnd .
7) 3/2 ≤ α ≤ 2: The achievable scheme that we present
in this regime also spans two time instants. At t = 0, all users
use all their nd levels to transmit independent bits. However,
the top (2 − α)nd levels get interfered and this is caused by
the bottom (2−α)nd levels of other transmitters. So, at t = 1,
the users re-transmit these (2 − α)nd interfering bits from the
top levels and use the remaining levels to transmit independent
bits. These bits, now received above the direct signal level of
other receivers can be used for decoding the interfered (2 −
α)nd bits of the ﬁrst time instant. Thus, in 2 time instants, each
user gets (nd + (nd − (2 − α)nd )) bits, so that the sum-rate
3
achieved is again 2 αnd .
8) α ≥ 2: In this regime, all interference is above the direct
signal levels at each receiver so that the upperbound of 3nd
is easily achieved by transmitting independent bits from all
signal levels.
III. 3- USER FULLY- CONNECTED LDIC S
A. Fully-symmetric setting
The 3-user crown channels are close to the fully-connected
LDIC except that in one the interfering links from user 2 to
users 1 and 3 are missing, while in the other, there is no
interference caused to user 2. However, for α ≥ 2/3, we
showed that exactly the same transmission strategy works for
both the crown channels to achieve sum-capacity. It follows
immediately that the same strategy will work for the fullyconnected fully-symmetric 3-user LDIC for α ≥ 2/3 and
yield the same sum-rate. Since the sum-rate upperbounds for
the crown channels also upperbound this channel, its sumcapacity must be the same as that of the crown channels
for α ≥ 2/3. For α ≤ 2/3, let us consider users of the 3user fully connected LDIC in pairs and use the 2-user LDIC
upperbounds. This yields the following upperbound, which we
next show, is achievable.
R1 + R2 + R3 ≤

3(nd − nc ) 0 ≤ α ≤ 1/2,
3nc
1/2 ≤ α ≤ 2/3.

(8)

When 0 ≤ α ≤ 1/2, an achievable strategy is for each user
to transmit independent bits from the top nd − nc levels and

techniques as in [11], we arrive at the following single-letter
upperbound:
Rsum ≤ H(Y1 |V1 V21 ) + H(Y2 |V23 V32 ) + H(Y3 |V31 ). (13)
For an LDIC, this bound is maximized by assuming uniform
input distribution, which yields the corresponding upperbound:
Rsum ≤ (n11 − n21 )+ + max(n21 , (n22 − n32 )+ )
+ max(n33 , n32 ).

Fig. 6.

An asymmetric 3-user LDIC

keep silent at the other levels. Since α ≤ 1/2, interference at
each receiver is contained at the levels that are not used for
transmission.
When 1/2 ≤ α ≤ 2/3, each user transmits independent
bits from the top-most 2nc − nd levels and the bottom-most
nd − nc levels, while transmitting nothing from the middle
nd − nc levels. Here again, since α ≤ 2/3, all the interference
is contained in the non-transmitting middle levels.
The achievable strategies for the 3-user fully-symmetric
fully-connected LDIC can be directly extended to a general
K-user case due to the symmetry in the schemes used by
each of the users.
B. An asymmetric case
For the fully-symmetric case, we found that the 2-user LDIC
bounds were sufﬁcient to obtain the sum-capacity. Next, we
consider an example asymmetric channel to demonstrate that
such bounds are not sufﬁcient in general. Consider the channel
showed in Fig. 6. For this channel, considering the capacity
regions of each of the 2-user LDICs, the tightest upperbound
on the achievable sum-rate obtained by linear programming is
21
4 . However, below we derive a new sum-rate upperbound for
a fully-connected 3-user general deterministic channel, which
is a natural extension of the models considered in Section II-A.

When we specialize this bound to the LDIC considered in
Fig. 6 it yields a value of 5 bits, which is easily achievable
by sending uncoded bits on the shaded levels in Fig. 6.
IV. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK
In this paper we have characterized the sum-capacity of 3
classes 3-user LDICs in symmetric parameter settings. The
upperbounds used are obtained by using the bounds for the
component 2-user LDICs. The achievable schemes devised
need use of two time units for many parameter values. The
result extends readily to the K-user fully-connected LDIC and
matches the GDoF results of [10]. In case of asymmetric fullyconnected 3-user LDIC we demonstrate through an example
that such upperbounding is not sufﬁcient and we need to derive
newer upperbounds. Future work in this direction would be
to characterize the fully-connected 3-user LDIC in a partially
symmetric parameter setting and also extending the results to
the corresponding Gaussian cases.
