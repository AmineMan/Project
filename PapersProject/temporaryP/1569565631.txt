Abstract—Levenshtein improved the Welch bound on aperiodic
correlation by weighting the cyclic shifts of the sequences
over complex roots-of-unity. Although many works have been
concerned on meeting the Welch bound with equality, no such
effort has been reported for the Levenshtein bound. We show
that the Levenshtein bound with equality is met if and only if
the non-trivial aperiodic correlations have identical amplitude
for all time-shifts, and the sequences form a novel class of
complementary set whose aperiodic correlation is deﬁned as
the conventional aperiodic correlation modulated by a simplex
weighting vector.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Welch obtained the correlation lower bounds for equienergy sequence sets based on the inner product theorem
of the vector set [1]. Massey et al obtained the necessary
and sufﬁcient condition of meeting the Welch bound (on
total squared correlations) with equality [2],[3], and found
that the sum capacity of synchronous code-division multipleaccess (CDMA) system is maximized by the Welch bound
equality (WBE) sequence sets [4]. Mow showed that for
asynchronous CDMA system, the maximum worst-case signalto-noise ratio (SNR) is met if and only if the sequences
form a complementary set [5]-[7], which has zero non-trivial
aperiodic correlation summations [8],[9]. Ever since then, a lot
of works have been concerned on the WBE sequences [10][13].
In [14], Levenshtein proposed a lower bound on aperiodic
correlation of binary sequence set by the inequality on the
mean of the weighted squared correlations, and showed that it
is tighter than the Welch bound for K ≥ 4 and N ≥ 2, where
K denotes the sequence set size, and N the sequence length.
In this paper, we show how to meet the Levenshtein bound
with equality by using a particular weighting vector, and when
that equality is met, the sequences will form a weightedcorrelation complementary set characterized by this weighting
vector.
Notations and deﬁnitions are given in Section II.A, followed
by a brief review of the Levenshtein bound in Section II.B.
The problem of meeting the Levenshtein bound with equality
is studied in Section III, and then concluded in Section IV.

When u = v, ρau ,av (τ ) is called the aperiodic auto-correlation
function, and will be written as ρau (τ ) for ease of presentation;
otherwise, aperiodic cross-correlation function.

for τ ̸= 0, we say that the sequences of A form a conventional complementary set with zero non-trivial aperiodic autocorrelation summations.
Deﬁnition 2: Denote by δmax the maximum non-trivial
aperiodic correlation magnitude of A as
δmax = max {|ρau ,av (τ )| : u ̸= v, or u = v, τ ̸= 0} . (3)

III. M EETING THE L EVENSHTEIN BOUND WITH EQUALITY
For any sequence a in A ⊆ {1, −1}N , construct a matrix
Ha of size (2N − 1) × (2N − 1), such that the sth row of Ha
is
Ha (s, :) = T s (a, 0) ,
(13)

The right cyclic shift of i (where 0 ≤ i ≤ N − 1) positions
for any vector a = (a0 , a1 , · · · , aN −1 ) is denoted by
T i a = (aN −i , aN −i+1 , · · · , aN −1 , a0 , a1 , · · · , aN −i−1 ).
For matrix H of size p × q, we say that H(i, :), H(:, j),
H(i, j) are the ith row, jth column, (i, j)th element of H,
respectively, where 0 ≤ i ≤ p − 1 and 0 ≤ j ≤ q − 1.

where s ∈ {0, 1, · · · , 2N − 2}. Let fi,j,s (a) =
Ha (s, i)Ha (s, j)ws , then for the two binary sequence sets A
and B deﬁned in Section II.B, Levenshtein found that [14]:

IV. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have shown that the Levenshtein bound
(for aperiodic correlation) is met with equality if and only if
the sequences of the binary sequence set form a weightedcorrelation complementary set and their non-trivial aperiodic
correlations take identical amplitude for all time-shifts. The
same conclusion can also be easily shown to hold for sequence
sets over complex roots-of-unity whose alphabet phases are
more than 2 [15], yet the proof is omitted.
As expected, meeting the Levenshtein bound with equality
is more stringent, and the search for the bound-achieving
sequence set remains an open problem. For such boundachieving sequence set, however, we note that:
1) If such a bound-achieving sequence set exists, the corresponding weighting vector, with which those boundachieving sequences form a weighted-correlation complementary set, will be the one which maximizes the
Levenshtein bound over all the weighting vectors.
2) For an arbitrary weighting vector w∗ which does not
maximize the Levenshtein bound, one cannot ﬁnd a
bound-achieving sequence set whose sequences form
a weighted-correlation complementary set characterized
by w∗ .
3) It is noted that the Welch bound cannot be improved for
set size of 21 , because the tightest Levenshtein bound
in that case is achieved by the Welch bound when the
weighting vector with all equal elements is used [14].
Hence, in the context of 1), such weighted-correlation
complementary set will degenerate to a Golay complementary pair.
4) In the end, if a Golay complementary pair of lengthN does not exist, the Levenshtein bound for set size
of 2 will be loose because the equality cannot be met.
For instance, it has been shown that the binary Golay
complementary pair of N < 100 doesn’t exist unless
N = 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 16, 20, 26, 32, 40, 52, 64, 80 [16].

pair [5]. Note that a complementary set has a set size of 2 or more.
