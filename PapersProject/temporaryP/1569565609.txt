a simple, connected and undirected graph with V as the set
of vertices and E as the set of edges. Let u and v be vertices
in V . If u and v are adjacent to each other, then the edge
between u and v is denoted by {u, v} or in short by uv. The
distance between u and v is denoted by d(u, v) and is deﬁned
as the number of edges in any shortest path between u and
v. Let r be a positive integer. We say that u r-covers v if the
distance d(u, v) is at most r. The ball of radius r centered at
u is deﬁned as

Abstract—The concept of identifying codes was introduced
by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin in 1998. Their original
motivation for studying these codes comes from fault diagnosis
in multiprocessor systems. Recently, other applications such as
locating objects in sensor networks have been proposed.
We deﬁne an r-identifying code in a graph G = (V, E) as a
subset C ⊆ V such that for each u ∈ V the intersection of C
and the ball of radius r centered at u is nonempty and unique.
Since the seminal paper on the subject, determining the smallest
densities of identifying codes in various inﬁnite grids has been one
of the essential problems in the ﬁeld. In this paper, we consider
2-identifying codes in the inﬁnite square and hexagonal grids.
Previously, it has been shown that there exists a 2-identifying
code in the square grid with density 5/29 ≈ 0.172 and that there
are no 2-identifying codes with density smaller than 3/20 = 0.15.
Recently, the lower bound has been improved to 6/37 ≈ 0.162
by Martin and Stanton (2010). We further improve the lower
bound by showing that there are no 2-identifying codes in the
square grid with density smaller than 6/35 ≈ 0.171.
Moreover, there exists a 2-identifying code in the hexagonal
grid with density 4/19 ≈ 0.211. Currently, the best known
lower bound for this case is 1/5 = 0.2 by Martin and Stanton
(2010). We improve this lower bound to 4/19, i.e. show that the
construction with density 4/19 is optimal.

Br (u) = {x ∈ V | d(u, x) ≤ r}.
A nonempty subset of V is called a code in G, and its
elements are called codewords. Let C ⊆ V be a code and u
be a vertex in V . An I-set (or an identifying set) of the vertex
u with respect to the code C is deﬁned as
Ir (C; u) = Ir (u) = Br (u) ∩ C.
The following deﬁnition of identifying codes is due to [11].
Deﬁnition 1. Let r be a positive integer. A code C ⊆ V is
said to be r-identifying in G if for all u, v ∈ V (u = v) the
set Ir (C; u) is nonempty and

I. I NTRODUCTION
The concept of identifying codes was introduced in 1998
by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin [11]. The original
motivation for studying these codes comes from fault diagnosis
in multiprocessor systems. In multiprocessor systems, where
processors are linked to the other ones, identifying codes
can be deﬁned as follows. Assign to a set of processors the
following task: each processor outputs a single value true
if the processor itself or one of the neighbouring ones are
malfunctioning, and otherwise false is outputted. We say that
this set of chosen processors forms an identifying code if the
malfunctioning processor(s) can be located using solely the
information provided by the selected processors. Similarly,
identifying codes can be applied for locating objects in sensor
networks as was suggested by Ray et al. in [14]. Moreover,
identifying codes ﬁnd their motivation also in various other
applications such as environmental monitoring [2], routing in
wireless networks [12], and ﬁre and intruder alarm systems
[15].
For the formal deﬁnition of identifying codes, we ﬁrst need
to introduce some preliminary notations. Let G = (V, E) be

Ir (C; u) = Ir (C; v).
Let X and Y be subsets of V . The symmetric difference
of X and Y is deﬁned as X △ Y = (X \ Y ) ∪ (Y \ X).
We say that the vertices u and v are r-separated by a
code C ⊆ V (or by a codeword of C) if the symmetric
difference Ir (C; u) △ Ir (C; v) is nonempty. The deﬁnition
of r-identifying codes can now be reformulated as follows:
C ⊆ V is an r-identifying code in G if and only if for all
u, v ∈ V (u = v) the vertex u is r-covered by a codeword of
C and
Ir (C; u) △ Ir (C; v) = ∅.
In this paper, we study identifying codes in the inﬁnite
square and hexagonal grids. We deﬁne the square grid GS =
(VS , ES ) as follows: the set of vertices VS = Z2 and the set of
edges ES = {{u, v} | u, v ∈ Z2 , u−v ∈ {(0, ±1), (±1, 0)}}.
In other words, two vertices are adjacent in GS if the Euclidean distance between them is equal to 1. Part of the inﬁnite
square grid GS and a 2-identifying code in GS are illustrated

this construction is optimal, i.e. there do not exist 1-identifying
codes in GS with smaller density. For general r ≥ 2, Charon
et al. [3] showed that each r-identifying code C in GS
has density D(C) ≥ 3/(8r + 4). Furthermore, Honkala and
Lobstein [8] presented r-identifying codes in the square with
D(C) = 2/(5r) if r is even and D(C) = 2r/(5r2 − 2r + 1)
if r is odd. For small values of r, these general constructions
have been improved in [4] by Charon et al.
In [8], besides the general constructions, Honkala and
Lobstein also presented a 2-identifying code with density
5/29 ≈ 0.172 (see Figure 1). By the general lower bound
mentioned above, we know that each 2-identifying code C in
GS satisﬁes D(C) ≥ 3/20 = 0.15. This general lower bound
was improved by Martin and Stanton in [13] by showing that
the density of any 2-identifying code in the square grid is at
least 6/37 ≈ 0.162. In this paper, we further improve this
lower bound to 6/35 ≈ 0.171 hence signiﬁcantly reducing the
gap between the lower and upper bounds.
As in the square grid GS , r-identifying codes have also been
intensively studied in the hexagonal grid GH . The ﬁrst results
concerning r-identifying codes in GH have been presented
in the seminal paper [11] in the case r = 1. Later these
results have been improved by showing that there exists a
1-identifying code with density 3/7 (see Cohen et al. [6])
and that there do not exist 1-identifying codes in GH with
density smaller than 12/29 (see Cranston and Yu [7]). For
general r ≥ 2, Charon et al. [3] showed that each r-identifying
code C in GH has D(C) ≥ 2/(5r + 3) if r is even and
D(C) ≥ 2/(5r + 2) if r is odd. Moreover, Stanton [17]
presented a construction for each r ≥ 2 giving an r-identifying
code C ⊆ VH with D(C) ∼ 5/(6r).
For small values of r, the previous constructions have been
improved in [4] by Charon et al. In particular, it is shown that
there exists a 2-identifying code in GH with density 4/19.
In the case r = 2, the aforementioned general lower bound
is improved in Martin and Stanton [13] by showing that the
density of any 2-identifying code in GH is at least 1/5. In this
paper, we further improve this lower bound to 4/19. In other
words, we show that the previously presented 2-identifying
code with density 4/19 is optimal.
The proofs of the lower bounds are based on a technique
which combines the concept of share with an averaging
process. The share and its usage in obtaining lower bounds
are explained in Section II. The actual proofs (or sketches of
them) with the averaging process for the square and hexagonal
grids are presented in Sections III and IV, respectively. The
presentation of the paper is based on [9] and [10] (see arXiv).

Fig. 1. The square grid GS and a 2-identifying code in GS illustrated. The
code, which is formed by the shaded vertices, is constructed by repeating the
pattern in the dashed box. Hence, the density of the code is 5/29.

in Figure 1, where lines represent the edges and intersections
of the lines represent the vertices of GS , and the codewords
are marked as shaded dots.
The hexagonal grid GH = (VH , EH ) using the brick wall
representation is deﬁned as follows: the set of vertices VH =
Z2 and the set of edges EH = {{u = (i, j), v} | u, v ∈
Z2 , u − v ∈ {(0, (−1)i+j+1 ), (±1, 0)}}. Part of the inﬁnite
hexagonal grid GH and a 2-identifying in GH are illustrated
in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. The hexagonal grid GH and a 2-identifying code in GH illustrated.
The code, which is formed by the shaded vertices, is constructed by repeating
the pattern in the dashed box. Hence, the density of the code is 4/19.

In order to measure the size of an identifying code in the
inﬁnite hexagonal and square grids, we introduce the notion
of density. For the formal deﬁnition, we ﬁrst deﬁne
Qn = {(x, y) ∈ Z2 | |x| ≤ n, |y| ≤ n}.
Then the density of a code C ⊆ Z2 is deﬁned as
D(C) = lim sup
n→∞

|C ∩ Qn |

|Qn |

Naturally, we try to construct identifying codes with as small
density as possible. Moreover, we say that an r-identifying
code is optimal, if there do not exist any r-identifying codes
with smaller density.

USING SHARE

Let G = (V, E) be a simple, connected and undirected
graph. Assume that C is a code in G. The following concept
of the share of a codeword has been introduced by Slater in
[16]. The share of a codeword c ∈ C is deﬁned as

Previously, r-identifying codes in the square grid GS have
been studied in various papers. In the case r = 1, a 1identifying code in GS with density 7/20 is constructed in [5].
Moreover, it has been proved by Ben-Haim and Litsyn [1] that

sr (C; c) = sr (c) =
u∈Br (c)

.
|Ir (C; u)|

The notion of share proves to be useful in determining lower
bounds of r-identifying codes (as explained in the following).
Assume that G = (V, E) is a ﬁnite graph and D is a code in
G such that Br (u) ∩ D is nonempty for all u ∈ V . Then it is
easy to conclude that c∈D sr (D; c) = |V |. Assume further
that sr (D; c) ≤ α for all c ∈ D. Then we have |V | ≤ α|D|,
which immediately implies
(0,0)

|D| ≥ |V |.
α
Assume then that for any r-identifying code C in G we
have sr (C; c) ≤ α for all c ∈ C. By the aforementioned
observation, we then obtain the lower bound |V |/α for the size
of an r-identifying code in G. In other words, by determining
the maximum share, we obtain a lower bound for the minimum
size of an r-identifying code.
The previous reasoning can also be generalized to the case
when an inﬁnite graph is considered. More precisely, if for any
r-identifying code C in an inﬁnite graph we have sr (C; c) ≤
α for all c ∈ C, then it can be shown that the density of
an r-identifying code is at least 1/α (compare to Theorems 5
and 6). The proofs of the lower bounds (in Sections III and
IV) are based on this observation, although we use a more
sophisticated method by showing an upper bound for the share
of a codeword on average. In Theorem(s) 5 (and 6), we present
a formal proof to verify that this method is indeed valid.

correspond to the dashed areas in the ﬁgure):

In the proof of the lower bound, we need to determine upper
bounds for shares of codewords. To formally present a way to
estimate shares, we ﬁrst need to introduce some notations. Let
D ⊆ V be a code and c be a codeword of D. Consider then the
I-sets Ir (D; u) when u goes through all the vertices in Br (c).
(Notice that all of these I-sets do not have to be different.)
Denote the different identifying sets by I1 , I2 , . . . , Ik , where
k is a positive integer. Furthermore, denote the number of
identifying sets equal to Ij by ij (j = 1, 2, . . . , k). Now we
are ready to present the following lemma, which provides a
method to estimate the shares of the codewords.

I2 (D; u) = {(0, 0), (1, 1)} for u = (0, 2), (1, −1), (1, 1)
or (2, 0),
I2 (D; u) = {(−1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1)} for u = (−1, 1),
(0, 0), (0, 1) or (1, 0),
I2 (D; u) = {(−1, 0), (0, 0)} for u = (−2, 0), (−1, −1),
(−1, 0) or (0, −1), and
I2 (D; (0, −2)) = {(0, 0)}.

Thus, by Lemma 2, we obtain that s2 (C; (0, 0)) ≤
(1/2 + 3 · 1/3) + (1/3 + 3 · 1/4) + (1/2 + 3 · 1/3) + 1 =
61/12.

FOR THE SQUARE GRID

The following presentation is based on [9, Section 3]. Here
we present the main ideas of the proof and for the details the
interested reader is referred to the full paper. For the rest of the
section, assume that C is a 2-identifying code in GS . In what
follows, we show that on average the share of a codeword is
at most 35/6.
The averaging process is done by introducing a shifting
scheme designed to even out the shares among the codewords
of C. The shifting scheme for the square grid consists of 10
different rules. The modiﬁed share of a codeword c ∈ C,
which is obtained after the shifting scheme is applied, is
denoted by s2 (c). It can be shown that we have s2 (c) ≤ 35/6
¯

for all c ∈ C. The following example illustrates one of the ten
rules in the scheme and its usage to even out the share among
codewords.

Lemma 2. Let C be an r-identifying code in G and let D
be a nonempty subset of C. For c ∈ D, using the previous
notations, we have
sr (C; c) ≤

The Example 3 illustrated. The shaded dots represent codewords of

.

Proof: Assume that c ∈ D. Then, for each j =
1, 2, . . . , k, deﬁne Ij = {u ∈ Br (c) | Ij = Ir (D; u)}. Now
it is obvious that for at most one vertex u ∈ Ij we have
Ij = Ir (C; u) and the other vertices of Ij are r-covered by at
least |Ij | + 1 codewords of C. Hence, the claim immediately
follows.
The previous lemma ﬁnds out to be very useful for approximating shares of codewords. The use of the lemma is
illustrated in the following example in the square grid.

Example 4. One of the ten rules in the shifting scheme is
illustrated in Figure 4(a). In the rule, 1/20 units of share
is shifted from u to v. In addition to the constellation in
the ﬁgure, translations, rotations (by π/2, π and 3π/2 about
the vertex u) and reﬂections (over the line passing vertically
through u) can be applied to the rule in such a way that
structure of the underlying graph GS is preserved.

Example 3. Let C be a 2-identifying code in the square grid
GS . Assume that D = {(−1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 1)} is a subset of

Since |Qk | = (2k + 1)2 for any positive integer k, it is
straightforward to conclude from the previous inequality that
the density D(C) ≥ 6/35.

IV. O PTIMAL LOWER BOUND

(a) One of the rules illustrated.
Fig. 4.

The following considerations are based on [10, Section 3].
For the rest of the section, assume that C is a 2-identifying
code in GH . It can be shown that s2 (c) ≤ 5 for all c ∈
C. This provides another approach to obtain the lower bound
D(C) ≥ 1/5, which was previously shown in [13]. In order
to improve this lower bound, we need to consider the shares
of codewords on average. Using a shifting scheme consisting
of 10 different rules and some modiﬁcations of them, we can
show that on average the share of a codeword is at most 19/4.
Therefore, using a proof similar to Theorem 5, we obtain the
following result.

(b) Example of using rules

The constellations of Example 4 illustrated.

Consider then the codeword c = (0, 0) with the constellation of codewords and non-codewords inside B4 (c) as
illustrated in Figure 4(b). The share of the codeword c is
6, i.e. s2 (c) = 6. The introduced rule can be applied to
c (four times). Hence, 1/20 units of share is shifted from
c to each of the vertices (−3, 0), (0, −3), (0, 3) and (3, 0).
(Recall that translations, rotations and reﬂections can be applied to the constellation in Figure 4(a).) Therefore, we have
s2 (c) = s2 (c)−4·1/20 = 6−1/5 = 29/5 ≤ 35/6. Moreover,
¯
it can be shown that the shares of the codewords (−3, 0),
(0, −3), (0, 3) and (3, 0) are at most 35/6 even after share is
shifted to them.

GH , then the density

Notice that each vertex u ∈ Qn−2 with |I2 (u)| = i contributes
the summand 1/i to s2 (c) for each of the i codewords

codewords in Qn cannot shift share to codewords outside
