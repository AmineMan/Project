decoding complexity. Related work has been carried out by,
among others, Rajan et al. (see e.g. [13]). They considered
fast-decodable distributed space-time codes arising from Clifford algebras. Our work differs from theirs in that our codes
achieve the NVD property and hence the NAF DMT. The
codes proposed in this paper moreover have a nice algebraic
structure which makes analyzing the codes easier, and are also
suitable for the parallel MIMO channel.
List of contributions:

Abstract—In this paper, fast-decodable lattice code constructions are designed for the nonorthogonal amplify-and-forward
(NAF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. The constructions are based on different types of algebraic structures, e.g.
quaternion division algebras. When satisfying certain properties,
these algebras provide us with codes whose structure naturally
reduces the decoding complexity. The complexity can be further
reduced by shortening the block length, i.e., by considering
rectangular codes called less than minimum delay (LMD) codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION

The quality of wireless long distance communications can
be signiﬁcantly improved by using cooperative diversity techniques. Cooperating relays can be positioned between the
source station and the destination to aid the transmission
by either amplifying and forwarding (AF) or decoding and
forwarding (DF) the signal. Spatially separated terminals will
allow an increment in the diversity in a distributed manner.
Depending on the application, a one-hop or multi-hop transmission is called for. Here, we consider multi-hop distributed
space-time codes employing a half-duplex NAF protocol [1],
[2]. It is known [2] that the NAF protocol outperforms all other
AF protocols since, as opposed to orthogonal protocols, it can
keep transmitting also during the transmission of the relays.
In addition, the AF protocols are less complex than the DF
protocols. This type of low cost relay systems are called for
in e.g. digital video broadcasting (DVB) [5].
In [3] and [6], Yang et al. and Hollanti et al. proposed blockdiagonal space-time code constructions for the asymmetric
MIMO channel with or without relays. The constructions arise
from cyclic division algebras constructed over a higher degree
center. A non-vanishing determinant (NVD) is then achieved
by forming a block-diagonal matrix consisting of the left
regular representation of the algebra and its Galois conjugates
from the center to the base ﬁeld. It was also shown [4,
Theorem 4] that a block-diagonal structure together with the
NVD property is enough to achieve the diversity-multiplexing
gain tradeoff (DMT) of the NAF channel. Motivated by this
and the urge for complexity reduction of MIMO codes in
general, we impose further properties that the algebras and the
constructions should satisfy in order to reduce the complexity.
Our study reveals a trade-off between the coding gain and

Explicit fast-decodable space-time relay codes are proposed.
All the codes have full diversity, some even NVD. To the
best of the authors’ knowledge, these are the ﬁrst fastdecodable distributed space-time codes with NVD.
According to [4, Theorem 4], the proposed codes that
have NVD achieve the optimal DMT of the NAF channel.
The constructions arise from quaternion or other type of
algebras making it easy to determine the coding gain,
complexity and other properties of the codes.
Although our explicit examples are for the case when the
source and the relays each have only one antenna, the
constructions are easily generalizable to other numbers of
antennas and relays as well. The codes are also suitable
for parallel MIMO channels.
We demonstrate a performance-complexity tradeoff resulting from the used method.
Finally, we analyze the worst-case decoding complexity
of the proposed codes.

Let us ﬁnish this introductory section by giving a couple
essential deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 1.1: If the code C consisting of matrices X
satisﬁes
min det(X † X) > κ > 0,
0=X∈C

we say that C has the non-vanishing determinant property
(NVD).
In case of square matrices, we simply refer to det(X) when
talking about NVD.
There are multiple deﬁnitions of rate, but we will consistently use the following.
Deﬁnition 1.2: Let B1 , . . . , Bk ∈ Mn×T (C) be the gener-

1

ator matrices (over R) of a rank-k code C, so

(real) dimensions per channel use (dpcu).
Note that the commonly used rate in complex dimensions
per channel use is R/2 when using the above notation.

so the vectorization of every received codeword corresponds
to a real vector Bg, with g = (g1 , . . . , gk )† having coefﬁcients
in the real alphabet S in use.
Now ﬁnding arg min{||Y − HX||2 }X∈C is equivalent to
F
ﬁnding arg min{||y − Bg||2 }g∈|S|k with respect to Euclidean
E
norm, where y is the vectorization of the received matrix Y .
The latter search is performed using a real sphere decoder [7],
with the complexity of exhaustive search being |S|k , as the
coefﬁcients of g run over all the values of S. Performing a
QR-decomposition of B = QR, with Q† Q = I, reduces ML
decoding to minimizing

II. S YSTEM MODEL FOR THE NAF RELAY CHANNEL

||y − QRg||2 = ||Q† y − Rg||2 ,
E

For ease of notation, we only deﬁne the single-relay model,
the generalization to multi-hop is straightforward. Following
[4], let us denote by Xi the signals transmitted from the source,
and by Yr the signal received by the relay which the relay then
ampliﬁes and forwards as BYr . The number of relays and the
number of antennas at the source, relays and destination are
denoted by N, ns , nr , nd , respectively. We assume nr is the
same for all relays r = 1, . . . , N . To be realistic, we assume
ns ≥ nr , since often the relays are mobile devices and hence
only contain one or two antennas. The destination is observing
Y1 and Y2 in consecutive time instances, and we have

where R is an upper right triangular matrix.
The number and structure of zeros of the matrix R may
improve the decoding complexity, formally deﬁned [9] to be
the minimum number of vectors g over which the difference
in (2) must be computed. When the complexity order (i.e., the
exponent of |S| in decoding complexity) is less than the rank
of the code, we say that the code is fast-decodable.
The authors of [8] establish when additional structure of the
code improves the decoding complexity by supplying criteria
when the zeros of R coincide with those of M , where M is a
matrix capturing information about orthogonality relations of
the basis elements Bj :

and F, H, G are the Rayleigh distributed channel matrices.
The power allocation πi factors are chosen so that SN R

receivers, while the transmitters have none. For more details,
we refer to [4].

Next we recall the class of codes which allows groups of
symbols to be decoded independently of one another.
Deﬁnition 3.1: A space-time code of dimension K is called
g-group decodable if there exists a partition of {1, . . . , K} into
g nonempty subsets J1 , . . . , Jg , so that the matrix element
Mj,l = 0 when j, l are in disjoint subsets Ji , Ji .

B1 , . . . , Bk , weighted by coefﬁcients g1 , . . . , gk , which are
PAM information symbols. The matrices B1 , . . . , Bk therefore
deﬁne our code. Each nr × T matrix HBi corresponds, via
vectorization, to a vector bi ∈ R2T nr obtained by stacking the
columns of HBi followed by separating the real and imaginary
parts. We deﬁne the (generating) matrix

where each Ri is a square upper triangular matrix. Hence,
the symbols xj and xl can be decoded independently when
their corresponding basis matrices Bj and Bl belong to disjoint subsets of the partition of the basis of the code (induced
by the partition of the indices).
More generally, recall from [12] that
Deﬁnition 3.2: A space-time code is called conditionally
g-group decodable if there exists a partition of the indices

B = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bk ) ∈ M2T nr ×k (R),

Remark 1: Note that a simple computation shows that the
zero structure of M is stable under premultiplication of Bi by
a channel matrix H. In general, the same does not hold for
R.
By the above discussion, in order to demonstrate fastdecodability (resp. g-group decodability), it sufﬁces to ﬁnd
an ordering on the basis elements Bi , which results in the
desired zero structure of M . We proceed to do that for the
proposed relay codes.

We proceed to show the rate four (4 PAM symbols per

which we extend to a K-basis consisting of 12 matrices

where z1 = 1, z2 = ζ7 + ζ7 , z3 = ζ7 + ζ7 .
Finally, we extend the basis above to a Q-basis by letting
√
Γk,j = −7Γk−4,j | k = 5, . . . , 8.

Now a Z-basis of our code C can be given by
{ατ (Γk,j )}k≤8,j≤3

where X is a matrix of the form
X=

and is of size 24. Indeed, the rank of C is 24, since each
codeword X encodes 2 symbols from L , or equivalently 24
real symbols.
We proceed to show that C is conditionally 4-group decodable with complexity |S|15 ; conditioned on decoding symbols
corresponding to {Γ5,1 , . . . , Γ8,3 }, the complexity of decoding
symbols corresponding to {Γ1,1 , . . . , Γ4,3 } is at most |S|3 ,
where S is the underlying alphabet. For that, note that when
A = Γk,j , B = Γk ,j , for all j, j and for 1 ≤ k = k ≤ 4,
we have
AB † + BA† = 0.

with c, d algebraic integers of L and τ acting on the elements
of the matrix X point-wise.
Then the code C has rank 24 and (real) decoding complexity
|S|15 . The code has the NVD property and hence is DMToptimal.
Proof: We ﬁrst establish the complexity claim. Consider
the generalized quaternion algebra Q = (−1, −11)K . Matrices X can be viewed as elements of Q via left regular
representation, followed by conjugation by a suitable matrix.
Conjugation by a matrix preserves the algebra structure and
does not affect the determinant, but can aid energy balance
and decoding complexity. The (conjugated) algebra Q has a
K -basis:
1 0
i 0
q1 =

0 1
0 −i

Same follows for ατ (A), ατ (B), i.e., we have:
ατ (A)ατ (B)† + ατ (B)ατ (A)† = 0.
Let Γ = {ατ (Γ1,1 ), . . . , ατ (Γ8,3 )} be the set of 24 generators
of C from (5) in lexicographical order. Then the matrix M
from Equation (3) capturing orthogonality relations on Γ has
the following structure:

ατ (Γ1,1 ), . . . , ατ (Γ4,2 ), ατ (iΓ1,1 ), . . . , ατ (iΓ4,2 )
gives the matrix M with the same zero structure as in Equation
(6) only now each coefﬁcient is a 2×2 matrix. Hence the code
is conditionally 4-group decodable with complexity |S|10 .
More precisely, conditioned on decoding symbols corresponding to {ατ (iΓ1,1 ), . . . , ατ (iΓ4,2 )}, the complexity of decoding
the rest of the symbols is at most |S|2 .

where each coefﬁcient of the matrix above is a 3 × 3
matrix, which is 0 when the coefﬁcient is 0. The reduction
in complexity follows from Equation (4).
Now we show the NVD property of the code C.
First we establish that all nonzero matrices X are invertible.
This will follow once we show that the algebra Q is division.
To that end, note that (−11, −1)K ∼ (−1, −11)K = Q,
=
therefore it sufﬁces to demonstrate that (−11, −1)Q(ζ7 ) is
division. This follows from techniques of [14]: we apply [14,
Theorem 7.1] while noting that F× 3 contains no element of
11
order 4, i.e., −1 is not a square in F113 , which is the residue
ﬁeld of the prime 11 in Q(ζ7 ).
To show that C actually has NVD, note that the determinant
of each codeword ατ (X) is ﬁxed by both τ and√ hence it
σ,
is an element, in fact an algebraic integer, of Q( −7) = K.
Moreover, it is nonzero whenever X is nonzero, since Q was
shown to be division, and hence is bounded away from 0, being
an algebraic integer in an imaginary quadratic extension of Q.
Therefore the code C has NVD property.

Remark 2: Here we have concentrated on a real sphere
decoding process. Note, however, that
{ατ (Γ1,1 ), ατ (Γ1,2 ), . . . , ατ (Γ4,1 ), ατ (Γ4,2 )}
is a Z(i)-basis of C. We can verify the relations
ατ (X)† ατ (Y ) + ατ (Y )† ατ (X) = 0,
X = Γk,j , Y = Γk ,j , where 1 ≤ k = k ≤ 4. Hence the
obtained code is 4-group decodable, of complexity degree 2
using a complex decoder.
V. L ESS THAN MINIMUM DELAY CODES FOR N = 2
RELAYS

In order to further reduce the complexity, we will shorten
the block length. Such less than minimum delay codes have
been considered in [10]. To this end, let us start by constructing
a code with dimension rate R = 2, i.e., the lattice is of rank
4 and the code matrix transmits two real dimensions (e.g. two
PAM symbols) per channel use.

B. Virtual 4 × 2 MIMO channel with N = 2, ns = nr = 1,
nd = 2
We use a similar idea as in the 6 × 6 case to construct fastdecodable rate four relay codes consisting of 4 × 4 matrices.

where

with c, d algebraic integers of K, σ : a → − a.
Again, each matrix X represents a conjugated element from
the quaternion algebra (a, γ)K , viewed as a 2×2 matrix via left
regular representation. Then for values a = 5, γ = −2, p = 31
the resulting code is a fully diverse code of rank 16. It is conditionally 4-group decodable with (real) decoding complexity
|S|10 . The code has NVD and is hence DMT-optimal.
Proof: We use similar techniques to the previous proof
to establish that (a, γ)K is division. First we observe that the
prime ideal 5Z splits completely in K. Therefore its residue
ﬁeld is isomorphic to F5 , so we see that γ = −2 is not a square
modulo 5 in the integers of K. Hence using [14, Theorem 7.1],
we conclude that Q = (a, γ)K is division. The generators of
Γk,j of Q over Q(i) are

and σ : ζ8 → ζ8 is complex conjugation, also denoted by ∗ .

where x = a1 + a2 ζ8 and a1 , a2 ∈ Z[i]. Due to the fact
that the code matrix only contains two QAM symbols, the
complexity will automatically be at most |S|4 , where S is the
underlying real alphabet.
Proposition 5.1: The matrices X † X, X = 0, have the
NVD property, and hence achieve the maximum diversity
min{nt , T } = 2 among the codes having the same matrix
size.

√
Γk,1 = qi , Γk,2 = qk p | k = 1, . . . , 4.
To check fast decodability, we verify the relations
ατ (X)† ατ (Y ) + ατ (Y )† ατ (X) = 0,

4

Proof: The proof is straightforward. Namely,
det(X † X) = 4xτ (x)x∗ τ (x)∗ = 4NQ(ζ8 )/Q (x) ∈ 4Z,
and hence det(X † X) ≥ 4.
Next, we extend the above construction to the case nd = 2
ideally calling for a rate four code.

it remains to be investigated how the codes perform compared
to other distributed codes that either have higher complexity
or lack NVD. Extended results [15] will be posted to arXiv
in the near future.

where x = a1 + a2 ζ8 + a3 θ + a4 ζ8 θ, θ = 1+2 5 , ai ∈ Z[i],
and ν = 1 + i − iθ generates a principal ideal that will make
the code lattice orthogonal. This ﬁeld extension is the same
as the one used for the extended golden algebra in [3]. The
complexity of the code is at most |S|8 .
Proposition 5.2: The matrices X † X, X = 0, have full
rank, i.e., a code consisting of the matrices X achieves the
maximum diversity min{nt , T } = 2 among the codes having
the same matrix size.
Proof: Again, the proof is very simple. We have
det(X † X) = (|νx|2 + |r(νx)|2 )(|τ (νx)|2 + |τ r(νx)|2 ) > 0.
Remark 3: We want to point out that, unfortunately, there is
no free lunch. Namely, with the above construction method,
increasing the code rate causes a degradation in the coding
gain. At the same time, reducing the delay from four to
two channel uses will naturally lower the maximum rank
(and diversity) the code matrix can achieve when compared
to a square code matrix. Hence, we observe a performancecomplexity tradeoff implying that while we can indeed reduce
the decoding complexity by reducing the code length, we
are likely to face worse performance caused by the reduction
in diversity. Increasing the rate (performance) here will also
require dropping the NVD property, again indicating a tradeoff
type behavior.

structure and NVD for different number of antennas
and relays. It was shown that the method used implies
a performance-complexity tradeoff. In other words, fastdecodable codes with NVD were proposed, while at the same
time it was noted that relaxing on the NVD property allows
for further complexity reductions. One efﬁcient way to reduce
the complexity is to employ less than minimum delay codes
that by construction already halve the complexity compared
to general minimum delay codes. Due to lack of space here,
