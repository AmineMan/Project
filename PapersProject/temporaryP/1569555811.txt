Abstract—We propose an authentication scheme where the
veriﬁer makes the decision based on the value of the metric
function, which is assigned depending on the type of the vector
stored in the database at the enrollment stage. The scheme has
a better performance than the maximum likelihood veriﬁcation
algorithm even for binary symmetric channels.

Rej: The vector y is generated by an arbitrary source speciﬁed by the probability distribution Ωn = ( Ω(y), y ∈
Y n ). If Ωn is a stationary memoryless distribution, then
we write Ω(y) = ω(y), where
n

ω(y) =

and specify the source by the probability distribution
ω=

where X and Y are ﬁnite sets. The veriﬁer makes one of two
decisions, Accept (Acc) or Reject (Rej), and the algorithm is
formalized as a mapping

ω(y), y ∈ Y .

The Acc and the Rej cases simulate the situation when the
vector x represents the results of biometric measurements of
a person received at the enrollment stage and stored in a
database. The vector y appears at the veriﬁcation stage, and
the veriﬁer has to decide whether this vector can be considered
as a corrupted version of the vector x or not.
The decision has to be made when the V channel is known
to the veriﬁer, while the Ωn is assigned by an attacker, who
wants to pass through the authentication with the Acc decision.
The problem can be presented as follows: discriminate between the known non–stationary memoryless distribution and
an arbitrary probability distribution over the set Y n on the
basis of the received vector y .

Acc, if y ∈ Dx ,
Rej, if y ∈ Dx ,

where Dx ⊆ Y n , x ∈ X n , are the acceptance sets. These sets
have to be ﬁxed in advance in such a way that the veriﬁer can
reliably distinguish between the following cases.
Acc: The vector y is the result of noisy observations of the
vector x simulated as transmission of the vector x over
the memoryless channel

i.e., the conditional probability associated with the vector y, given the vector x. is expressed as

Ω(y)

The biometric authentication is based on extraction of
parameters from outcomes of biometric measurements of a
person that can be used to identify the person [1], [2], [3].
For instance, one can organize enrollment in such a way
that the length of observations is equal to the the number
of parameters and 1’s indicate positions, which of them are
signiﬁcant for the particular person. If the algorithm always
extracts a ﬁxed number of signiﬁcant parameters from each
sequence of observations [4], an attacker knows the weight of
the vector, which is stored in the database to identify of the
person. The attacker wants to substitute an artiﬁcial sequence
that is recognized as a sequence of outcomes of the person
and leads to the acceptance of the identity claim by the veriﬁer
[5]. The knowledge of the weight can essentially increase the
power of the attacker when the decision is made on the basis
of the likelihood of the observations received at the veriﬁcation
stage.
We develop our previous approaches to the authentication
problem [6] and consider the scheme given in Figure 1. The
veriﬁer is given a pair of vectors

To illustrate the difﬁculties of the problem, let us consider
the case when X = Y = {0, 1} and the V channel is deﬁned
by the matrix

The problem is formalized as three requirements.

x ∈ X n.
The regular construction is understood as a threshold–type
set
Dx = y ∈ Y n : m(x, y|Px ) < T ,
(2)

(1)

where ξ ∈ (0, 1/2). Suppose that the veriﬁer wants to have the
false rejection rate at most ε for a given vector x. Due to the
structure of the V channel, there is an obvious (the maximum
likelihood) decision: the veriﬁer does not pay attention to the
bits of the vector y received at positions where the vector
x contains ones and only controls the weight of the vector
received at positions where the vector x contains zeroes.
Namely, the vector y has to be included into the set Dx if and
only if the weight does not exceed the value of kε , deﬁned as
the minimum integer satisfying the inequality
kε

k=0

where the function m(x, y|Px ), called the normalized accumulated metric between the vectors x and y, is deﬁned as an
additive extension of the component–wise metric,
m(x, y|Px ) =

x∈TP

The RR requirement is oriented to practical applications of
the authentication scheme. For example, the scheme should
guarantee a certain false rejection rate for an arbitrary chosen
person whose biometric characteristics are expressed by the
vector x. In the formulation of the RA requirement, we assume
that the attacker knows the type of the vector x. The fact that
the attacker wants the false acceptance rate to be large for
all input vectors of type P results in the conclusion that the
optimum assignment of the probability distribution Ωn is a
ˆ
uniform distribution over the vectors of the same type Q, i.e.,

where wt(x) denotes the weight of the vector x. However,
such an assignment includes the all–zero vector in all acceptance sets. If Ω(y) is equal to 1 for y = (0, . . . , 0)
and equal to 0 for y = (0, . . . , 0), then the attacker always
gets the acceptance decision (notice that the all–zero vector
corresponds to the so–called wolf attack on a biometric system
in this case [5]).
The main direction of our research is the design of an
authentication algorithm that has good performance and it is
highly protected against information leakage. In particular, for
any binary memoryless channel, the authentication algorithm
is ﬁxed in such a way that the attacker cannot include his
knowledge about the weight of the sample vector into the
attack to increase the probability of acceptance. It gives us
reasons to refer to the designed scheme as to a scheme having
perfect algorithmic secrecy.

We conclude that the expected value of the normalized
accumulated metric, expressed by (7), is a constant for any
probability distribution ω. Another important characteristic of
the metric is the variance computed over the ensembles under
considerations,

One can easily see that both Var and Var(ω) tend to 0 as a
function 1/n when n increases. Hence, the use of Gaussian
approximations of the probability distributions of the metric
allows us to conclude that both the false rejection and the false
acceptance rates are exponentially vanishing functions of n.
Moreover, the maximization of the false acceptance rate by
an attacker is equivalent to the maximization of the variance.
This point will be considered in details for binary channels.

• The expected value of the metric in the Rej case does not
depend on q.
• The variance of the metric in the Rej case is maximized
2
when q = 1/2. If the threshold Tp is greater than σp ,
then the attacker, who presents either the all–zero or the all–
one vector, always passes through the veriﬁcation with the
2
acceptance decision. If T < σp , then the attacker has to
choose an q ∈ (0, 1), since he would always get the rejection
decision otherwise. At least when the probability distribution
of the metric is Gaussian, the maximum deviation from the
expected value is attained when the attacker maximizes the
variance of the metric. As a result, we come to the claim that
the p-veriﬁcation scheme has a perfect algorithmic secrecy in
the Rej case, meaning the following considerations. For any
cryptographic scheme, including our veriﬁcation scheme, there
is a blind attacker, who presents a vector generated by ﬂipping
a fair coin with probabilities of 0’s and 1’s equal to 1/2. It
turns out that if the attacker is informed about the weight of
the vector x and the veriﬁcation algorithm, then he cannot
include this knowledge into the attack and it does not change
the fair coin tossing strategy.
• The expected value of the metric in the Acc case is less
than the expected values of the metric in the Rej case.
• If p ∈ {0, 1}, then the variances of the metric vanish with
the length as the function 1/n in all cases under consideration.
• The ratios of the expected value of the metric and the
√
square root of the variance are proportional to σp n. The
false acceptance and the false rejection rates are determined by
the exponent of the square of this ratio taken with the negative
sign. Hence, the performance essentially depends on p and the
smallest probabilities of error are reached when p = 1/2.
A similar analysis with the Gaussian approximations for
the maximum likelihood (ML) veriﬁcation scheme, when the
veriﬁer computes the Hamming distance between the vectors
x and y, brings the conclusion that the performance essen˜ ∗
˜ ∗
tially depends on parameter q. Let FRR and FARq denote
the estimates of the false rejection and the false acceptance
rates for the ML-veriﬁcation scheme. If q = q ∗ , where q ∗
˜ ∗
maximizes FARq , the result differs from the false acceptance
rate attained with q = 1/2 by several orders of magnitude
(see Table I). Furthermore, we can prove that for any binary
symmetric channel, the p-veriﬁcation scheme brings a better
performance than the ML-veriﬁcation scheme in a sense that
˜ ∗
˜
˜ ∗

FARq > FARq , when FRR = FRR.
• The values of the metric function deﬁned by (5), (6)
depend on V for non-binary channels, but the properties above
are preserved.

An implementation of the scheme can be presented as follows. There are n+1 matrices specifying the component–wise
metric and n+ 1 values of the threshold stored in the memory.
Having received the vector x, the veriﬁer ﬁnds p = wt(x)/n,
reads the corresponding matrix and the threshold, computes
m′ (x, y|p) for the vector y using (14), (15), and checks
whether it is less than the threshold or not. Let E′ , E′ (ω) and
Var′ , Var′ (ωq ) are deﬁned by (9), (10) and (12), (13) when the
metric m′ is substituted for m.
Proposition 3. Let ω = ωq , where
(ωq (0), ωq (1)) = (1 − q, q)
and q ∈ [0, 1]. Then

Notice that the vector y is the value of a randomly chosen
vector Y n = (Y1 , . . . , Yn ) whose probability distributions in
the Acc and in the Rej cases are deﬁned as

Pr{ Y n = y | x} =

Pr{ Y

V (y|x),
ωq (y).

One can express these distributions as products of binomial
distributions. By the well–known fact of probability theory,
the binomial probability distribution converges to the Gaussian probability density function when the length of observations increases, the probabilities Pr{ m′ (x, Y n ) = µ | x}
and Pr{ m′ (x, Y n ) = µ | ωq } tend to Gaus(µ|E′ , Var′ ) and
Gaus(µ|E′ (ωq ), Var′ (ωq )), respectively, where Gaus(µ|E, σ 2 )
denotes the Gaussian probability density function with the
mean E and the variance σ 2 . In particular, if ξ0 = ξ1 = ξ
and T ′ = βσp is the threshold included into the deﬁnition
of the acceptance set for the vector x, then the Gaussian
approximations of the false rejection and the false acceptance
rates for the p-veriﬁcation scheme are expressed as

If β ∈ (2ξσp , σp ), then the use of the well-known estimates

exponents of FRR and FARq to the ratios (β − 2ξσp )2 /(2σξ )
2
and (β −σp )2 )/(2σq ), respectively, and we conclude that both
the false rejection and the false acceptance rates tend to 0
exponentially fast when the observation length increases. The
Gaussian approximations to the probability distributions of the
metric for the p-veriﬁcation scheme are illustrated in Figure 3.
An analysis of (16) and (17) brings the following conclusions.

V. C ONCLUSION
The veriﬁcation algorithm is an important cryptographic
tool of any data transmission scheme. We demonstrated this
point for the authentication setup where the vector generated
by a legitimate user is transmitted to the veriﬁer over a binary
memoryless channel. If the attacker’s capabilities are restricted
to the generation of a vector according to a memoryless

The absolute value of the difference of the obtained equalities

probability distribution and the p-veriﬁcation algorithm is

coin (the probabilities of zeroes and ones are equal to 1/2)
is the attack, which maximizes the false acceptance rate. As
a result, the attacker becomes equivalent to a blind attacker,
who is ignorant both about the weight of the input vector and
parameters of the channel.
