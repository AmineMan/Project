feedback states. We assume that the splitting parameters are
determined according to the outage events at the end of
the transmission block of the same information message at
both users in order to optimize the achievable Diversity Gain
Region (DGR) [6]. The channel state information (CSI) is
assumed to be perfectly known at the receivers but is unknown
at the transmitters. Therefore, we assume that the chosen
splitting parameters remain ﬁxed for ﬁxed rates, interference
level, and retransmission delay; the second transmitter can
only continue or cease the transmission of its common or
private message.
Next, we consider a cooperative ARQ scenario where the
second transmitter assists the ﬁrst one in relaying its message
in the event of a NACK reception at the ﬁrst transmitter. The
cooperative protocol divides into static decoding and dynamic
decoding. Under static decoding, we solve for the achievable
tradeoff by tracing the maximum of using either the CMO or
the TIAN schemes considering the relaying scenario. Under
dynamic decoding, the decoder of the ﬁrst user dynamically
changes its decoding algorithm to either consider the CMO
or the TIAN approach according to the channel conditions.
Finally, we show the superiority of the dynamic decoding
scheme over the static one.
We adopt a coherent delay-limited (or quasi-static) block
fading channel model where the channel gains are assumed
ﬁxed over the transmission of the same information message.
By doing this, we focus on the ARQ diversity advantage
without exploiting temporal diversity.

Abstract—We characterize the achievable three-dimensional
tradeoff between diversity, multiplexing, and delay of the
single antenna Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) Zinterference channel. Non-cooperative and cooperative ARQ
protocols are adopted under these assumptions. Considering no
cooperation exists, we study the achievable tradeoff of the ﬁxedpower split Han-Kobayashi (HK) approach. Interestingly, we
demonstrate that if the second user transmits the common part
only of its message in the event of its successful decoding and
a decoding failure at the ﬁrst user, communication is improved
over that achieved by keeping or stopping the transmission of
both the common and private messages. Under cooperation, two
special cases of the HK are considered for static and dynamic
decoders. The difference between the two decoders lies in the
ability of the latter to dynamically choose which HK special-case
decoding to apply. Cooperation is shown to dramatically increase
the achievable ﬁrst user diversity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The diversity and multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) framework
was initiated by Zheng and Tse [1] in standard Multi-Input
Multi-Output (MIMO) channels. EL Gamal et al. extended
Zheng and Tse’s work using Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) in delay-limited single link MIMO channels [2].
The authors in [2] showed that the ARQ retransmission delay
can be leveraged to enhance the reliability of the system at
a negligible loss of the effective throughput rate. In addition,
the authors in [3] considered cooperative schemes in ARQ
relay networks. This work explores the achievable diversity,
multiplexing, and delay tradeoff of the outage limited single
antenna ARQ Z-interference channel (ZIC) [4] in the high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptote. In particular, we extend
the tradeoff studied in [2] to the two user ARQ fading ZIC
setting for both non-cooperative and cooperative scenarios.
This work ﬁrst discusses a non-cooperative ARQ protocol
using the ﬁxed-power split Han-Kobayashi (HK) approach
[5], [6]. We stipulate that the second user transmits only
the common part of its message if it receives a positive
acknowledgement (ACK) while a negative ACK (NACK) is
received at the ﬁrst transmitter. By considering two special
cases of the HK splitting, a Common Message Only (CMO)
scheme and a Treating Interference As Noise (TIAN) scheme
(i.e. only a private message is sent from the second transmitter)
[6], we show the superiority of our transmission policy over
the other policies of continuing or stopping the transmission
of both the common and private messages under the stated

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a two user single antenna Rayleigh fading ZIC
model as shown in Fig. 1. Users always have information
messages to send. Each user in our model employs an ARQ
error control protocol with a maximum of L transmission
rounds. The information message from each transmitter is
encoded into a sequence of L vectors (blocks), {xi,l ∈ CT :
i = 1, 2 and l = 1, · · · , L}, where the transmission of each
vector takes T channel uses. Each decoder is allowed to
process its corresponding received signal over all l received
blocks. Each receiver sends an ACK back to its corresponding
transmitter when decoding is successful. A NACK is sent if
decoding fails. The ARQ feedback channel is assumed to be
error-free and of negligible delay.

Thus, the transmitted powers of the common and private
messages, in the high-ρ scale, can be written as1

and

.
P2,common = ρ.

(5)

When the two transmitters receive a NACK at round l, they
both begin the transmission of the next block of their current
messages. If TX1 receives a NACK while TX2 receives an
ACK, we stipulate that TX2 stops sending its private message
and keeps sending the common one until TX1 receives an
ACK. We motivate this transmission policy by observing two
special cases of the HK-splitting. The ﬁrst special case is when
TX2 uses the CMO scheme [6]. In this case, the best that TX2
can do when receiving an ACK while TX1 receives a NACK is
to keep sending the same message until TX1 receives an ACK.
This way, RX1 will accumulate more joint mutual information
hence reducing the probability of the joint outage event at RX1
when joint decoding is performed.
The other special scenario is the TIAN scheme obtained
from the HK approach by setting b = 0 and t2 = 0 [6]. Under
the TIAN scheme, we expect the diversity at RX1 to improve
if TX2 ceases the transmission of its current message when
receiving an ACK while TX1 receives a NACK since this
provides for less interference. The HK scheme with generic
splitting parameters lies midway between these two special
schemes and it is for this reason that we stipulate the stopping
of the private message when a NACK is received at RX1. Note
that, the average transmitted power at TX1 or TX2 will not
be affected by either continuing or stopping the transmission
of the same message after receiving an ACK and until the
other transmitter receives an ACK as the probabilities of such
events are very small for the case of the high-ρ scale. The
multiplexing rate of the both users will not be affected for
the same reason [7]. We can demonstrate the superiority of
our transmission policy over other approaches which consider
keeping or stopping the transmission of both the common and
private messages of TX2 when it receives an ACK while TX1
receives a NACK. The rate regions of these approaches can
be shown to be subsets of the rate region of our approach [7].

where {yi,l , ni,l } denote the received vector and the noise
vector at RXi, respectively. The noise vectors are modeled
as complex Gaussian random vectors with zero mean, unit
variance, and i.i.d. entries. They are also assumed to be temporally white. We use {hi,j : i, j = 1, 2} for the channel gain
between transmitter i and receiver j. The channel gains are
i.i.d. complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and
unit variance. They are assumed to remain constant over the
L transmission rounds and change to new independent values
with each new information message. We use a per-block power
￿1
￿
constraint such that E T ||xi,l ||2 ≤ ρ, i.e., the constraint
on the average transmitted power in each transmission round
of the ARQ protocol is the same. The parameter ρ takes on
the meaning of average SNR per receiver antenna. We also
parameterize the attenuation of transmit signal i at receiver
j using the real-valued coefﬁcients µij > 0. To simplify our
results, we set µ2 = µ2 = 1 and µ2 = ρβ−1 . The parameter

β represents the interference level, β ≥ 0.
We consider a family of ARQ protocols that is based on
a family of code pairs {C1 (ρ), C2 (ρ)} with ﬁrst block rates
R1 (ρ) and R2 (ρ), respectively, and an overall block length
T L. The individual error probability at RXi is Pei (L, ρ) for
i = 1, 2. For this family, the ﬁrst block multiplexing gains ri
and the effective ARQ diversity gains di (L) for L transmission
rounds are deﬁned as

ρ→∞

We consider here the use of the HK approach at TX2.
Speciﬁcally, TX2 maintains a private message, with rate
S2 = s2 log ρ, and a common message, with rate T2 = t2 log ρ.
Hence, r2 = s2 + t2 , s2 , t2 ≥ 0, and 0 ≤ ri ≤ 1. At RX1, we
consider a joint typical-set decoder applied to the message of
TX1 and the common message of TX2. At RX2, joint-typical
set detection is carried out for both the private and common
messages of TX2. For TX2, we parameterize the ratio of the
average private power to the total average power as

We consider the following ARQ protocol. When both transmitters receive an ACK, they each proceed to send the ﬁrst
block of their next messages. If TX1 receives an ACK while
TX2 receives a NACK, TX1 will cease its transmission until
TX2 receives an ACK. When TX1 receives a NACK for its
message, it begins the transmission of the next block of its
current message; while the behavior of TX2 varies according
to its feedback outcome and the used ARQ protocol as detailed
in the next sections. The reason for differentiating between
the case when TX1 receives an ACK while TX2 receives a
NACK and the reverse case is that the ﬁrst user message
is not decoded at the second receiver but not vice versa.
When the maximum number of protocol rounds L is reached,
both transmitters start transmitting the ﬁrst block of their next
messages regardless of the feedback outcome. Error at each
user occurs due to any of the following two events. Either
L transmission rounds are reached and decoding fails or the
decoder makes a decoding error at round l ≤ L and fails to
detect it (undetected error event).
The received signal vectors are given by

where, d11,HK (L, i) and d12,HK (L, i) are as given in (6).
The probability of the event Ci can be derived as follows,

Proof: Following the footsteps of [2], we can show that
the individual error probabilities are exponentially equal to
their respective outage probabilities for sufﬁciently large T .
The use of joint typical-set decoding limits the probability
of the undetected error event at any round l ≤ L to an
arbitrarily small value. Following the same techniques in [1],
the probability of decoding failure at round l = L at either
RX1 or RX2 is exponentially equal to the probability of the
corresponding outage event at the end of the L transmission
rounds. Thus, we have for i = 1, 2

In the high-ρ scale, the minimum negative exponent dominates

As for the CMO scheme, the outage regions at RX1 and
RX2 at round l = L can be given as follows.

where Pout,i (L) is the individual outage probability at RXi
and dout,i (L) is the diversity gain associated with Pout,i (L).
We then derive the individual outage probabilities for the
non-cooperative ARQ-ZIC system. When the accumulated
mutual information over the consecutive rounds at RX1(RX2)
is smaller than the ﬁrst block rate R1 (R2 ), an outage occurs.
It is sufﬁcient, without loss of optimality, to assume that the
input codewords are Gaussian distributed [2]. Thus, the mutual
information is identical over the protocol rounds. Let us deﬁne
Al and Bl as the outage events at RX1 and RX2 at round l,
respectively. For the HK scheme, the outage region at RX2 at

Using these outage regions, the results for the CMO scheme

Following similar steps as in [2], the effective multiplexing
gains re1 and re2 are equal to the ﬁrst block multiplexing gains
r1 and r2 , respectively, and hence the proof is completed (See
full proof in [7]).

IV. T HE C OOPERATIVE ARQ P ROTOCOL
Under cooperation, TX2 assists in relaying the message of
TX1 in the event of a NACK reception at TX1. Here, we ﬁrst
consider a static decoding scheme where the decoding scheme
at RX1, whether using the CMO or the TIAN decoding, is
ﬁxed and determined a priori according to the interference
level β and the multiplexing gains r1 and r2 . Next, we will
consider a dynamic decoding scheme where RX1 dynamically
decides at the beginning of each new transmission to use either
the CMO or the TIAN decoding according to the channel
gains, the interference level, and the multiplexing gains.
For the two cooperative ARQ schemes, if TX1 receives a
NACK, TX2 will start listening to TX1 to decode its message
regardless of its own feedback. Notice that we assume here a
link exists between TX1 and TX2. We denote the time TX2
takes to decode TX1 message by T ￿ . The following relation
holds,
￿￿
￿ ￿
T ￿ = min T,

T R1
log2 (1 + |h|2 ρ)

The overall achievable DMT curve, either between RX1 diversity and ﬁrst user multiplexing gain r1 or between RX2 diversity and second user multiplexing gain r2 , of the cooperative
ARQ with static decoding scheme for L = 2 is the maximum of
the achievable DMT using the CMO and the TIAN approaches.
Proof: It can be shown that the error event at RX1
is dominated by the outage event at the end of the second
transmission round A2 [2], [3], [7]. Thus, the probability of
this outage event is exponentially equal to the error probability
at RX1. We now derive this outage probability for the CMO
scheme. Let us state the corresponding outage event as

Once TX2 has decoded TX1’s message, it starts relaying

f ∈[r1 ,1]

For the TIAN scheme, the outage event at RX1 at the end
of the second transmission round can be expressed as

In this case, each time both TX1 and TX2 begin to transmit
new messages, RX1 decides to use either the CMO or the
TIAN decoding according to the channel conditions revealed
to it, h11 and h21 . The decoding scheme is no longer known a
priori but is dynamically decided each time users transmit new
messages. It is worthwhile noticing that the second transmitter
has no CSI to dynamically change its splitting parameters
according to the channel conditions [7].

V. C ONCLUSION
We characterized the achievable diversity, multiplexing,
and delay tradeoff for the outage limited two user single
antenna Rayleigh fading ARQ ZIC under the use of noncooperative and cooperative ARQ protocols. Under cooperation, we characterized the achievable tradeoff using static and
dynamic decoders. We used the well-known HK approach as
well as two special cases of it, where only a common or a
private message is transmitted, to derive achievability results.
Our characterization comes in closed-form expressions of the
individual diversities as a function of the maximum number
of transmission rounds (maximum delay), multiplexing gain
pairs, interference level, rate and power splitting parameters.

B. Cooperative ARQ with Dynamic Decoding

And,

Proof: (Sketch) Based on the dynamic decoding scheme,
outage at RX1 at the end of round 2 can be described as
A2 = {FT ￿ , {O1 ∪ O2 }, O3 }, where FT ￿ , O1 , O2 , and O3 are
as given in (20) and (25). The rest of the proof follows from
analyzing the outage region above by analogy to the analysis
of the static decoding scheme in the previous subsection and
is omitted due to space limitations (See full proof in [7]).
To summarize our work, we show the DMT of the ﬁrst user
under the use of all the previously mentioned ARQ schemes
for L = 2 in Fig. 2. It is obvious that the performance of
the cooperative ARQ with dynamic decoding is better than
the achievable performance of its static counterpart for some
values of the ﬁrst user multiplexing gain r1 .

Using similar arguments, we derive the result for dc
1,TIAN (2).
For both the CMO and TIAN schemes, it can be shown
that the error event at RX2 {E2 } is dominated by the events
{E2 , A1 , B2 } and {E2 , A1 , B1 }. The former event represents
the error event at RX2 when RX1 receives an ACK at the end
of round 1, while the latter represents the error event at RX2
when RX1 receives a NACK at the end of round 1 [7]. Thus,
