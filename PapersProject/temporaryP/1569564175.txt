constraint without any restrictions on the choice of modulation
state or on the allowed POVM measurements appears not to
have been obtained prior to this work.
If the sender and receiver in the communication framework
described above are co-located, but the phase shift is applied
at a different location, we obtain a model for a phase detection problem, an instance of quantum metrology, in which
probe state optimizations are often carried out [9]. Another
application is to the recently developed concept of quantum
reading of a classical digital memory [10]–[13] using quantum
states of light. The original proposal [10] considered the use
of a quantum transmitter state that reads a standard optically
encoded digital memory such as a CD or DVD with a bit
error probability better than that achievable with standard laser
sources. In [12], a phase-encoded memory, which has the
advantage that it can be lossless in principle, was proposed,
along with a probe state for reading it without error. This
memory encodes a bit 0 (1) as a 0 (⇡) rad phase shift imparted
to a probe beam on reﬂection from the encoding surface. As
such, it corresponds exactly to the M = 2 case of the problem
considered here.
Once the modulation state is chosen, the M -ary PSK
problem falls under the general rubric of distinguishing a
symmetric set of quantum states that has been extensively
studied in quantum decision theory [4], [5], [14], [15]. The
optimal quantum measurement for a given pure modulation
state was obtained in the pioneering works [4], [5], [14].
This optimal measurement, called variously as the SquareRoot Measurement (SRM), Least-Squares Measurement, and
Pretty Good Measurement, has many interesting properties and
has also been applied to quantum information theory [15].
In this paper, our concern is rather the design problem of
choosing the best (i.e., yielding the least error probability)
transmitter state under a given energy constraint, a problem
that has not yet been addressed in full generality in the
literature. Thus, we obtain the best modulation state optimized
over all quantum states, pure and mixed, and of any number of
signal and ancilla modes under an average energy constraint.
Our results are based on the existence of a simple function of
the multimode transmitter state that sufﬁces to determine the
error performance. This function clariﬁes the role of multiple
signal and ancilla modes in the transmitter state and, together
with the known form of the minimum error probability for
discriminating a symmetric set of states, enables ﬁnding the

Abstract—We develop a theory of quantum M -ary phase shift
keying in which quantum states of optical modes are modulated
at the transmitter by applying one of M uniformly-spaced phase
shifts. We allow full freedom in choosing modulation states
with any number of signal, i.e., transmitted, and ancilla modes,
subject only to an average energy, i.e., photon number, constraint
in either the signal modes alone or in the signal and ancilla
modes together. For lossless operation and unrestricted POVM
measurements at the receiver, we ﬁnd the explicit form of the
modulation state that minimizes the average error probability
under an energy constraint of N photons. Multiple signal modes,
mixed states, and entanglement with an ancilla are shown to be
unnecessary for optimum performance. We show that communication with zero error is possible if and only if N (M 1)/2.

In M -ary phase shift keying (M -PSK), a familiar modulation format in ordinary communications [1], one of M uniformly spaced phase shifts at the carrier frequency is applied to
a predetermined waveform for the purpose of communicating
one of M messages from the sender to the receiver. As the
demand for high-speed communication increases, M -ary PSK
with M > 2 is becoming attractive in optical communication, despite the increased system complexity, because it
provides an increase in the number of bits per transmitted
symbol without increasing the frequency bandwidth [2]. In
the quantum version of PSK, one or more optical modes
prepared in a predetermined quantum state is the analog of
the classical waveform to which information-bearing phase
shifts are applied. Unlike the classical case in which the signal
constellation is contained in a two-dimensional space, the
quantum version opens up the possibility of optimization of
the state that is subject to modulation.
Theoretical studies by Kato et al. [3], building on the
work of Helstrom [4] and Ban et al. [5], have demonstrated
an appreciable gap between the M -PSK performance using
the optimum quantum measurements and that using standard
heterodyne detection on coherent states from standard laser
sources. The study of modulation state optimization under
an energy constraint was pioneered by Hall and Fuss in
[6], although these authors studied only the single-mode case
under a certain restriction on the allowed POVM measurements [7]. They also pointed out that, given sufﬁcient energy,
communication with zero error probability is possible when
this restriction is relaxed. Shapiro [8] demonstrated zeroerror communication under a modiﬁed two-mode modulation
format. However, the optimal modulation state under an energy

II. T RANSMITTER O PTIMIZATION
A. Pure-State Transmitters with a Signal Energy Constraint
We ﬁrst present the basic result that, without invoking an
energy constraint or specifying J and J 0 , we can partition the
transmitter state space into equivalence classes of states having
the same error probability.

This state has the same p, so by Theorem 1 it has the same
performance as | iAS . Moreover, because the probabilities
pn that | iAS associates with n M all contribute to photon
numbers less than M in | iS , the signal energy in (19), as
given by Eq. (11), is not greater than that of the original
transmitter state. Thus, (19) provides the same performance
at equal or lesser signal energy than any state with the same p.

Theorem 1. Pure transmitters with the same p have the same
error performance in M -ary PSK. This statement encompasses
transmitters with differing J and/or J 0 .

which has energy (M 1)/2 and is therefore allowed by the
energy constraint. From (18), we see that Gmm0 = m,m0 so
that the output states are mutually orthogonal and the error
probability is zero.
It is remarkable that neither multiple signal modes nor
ancillary entanglement is necessary for optimum performance.
This is in contrast to the typical situation in ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert space where distinguishing two unitary operators beneﬁts from multiple applications of the unitaries [17] or where
entanglement with an ancilla helps in distinguishing more than
two unitary operators [18]. The zero-error property of the state
of Theorem 2 (b) was noted in [6], although this or any other
single-mode state cannot achieve error-free communication
under the restricted class of measurements allowed in [6].
The next result gives the form of the coefﬁcients of the
optimal transmitter state for a signal energy constraint NS <
(M 1)/2 and also shows that any transmitter state achieving
zero-error must have signal energy at least (M 1)/2.

⌫=0

The equality (18) follows because, for any m and m0 , the
exponential factor is periodic in n with period M . Thus the
Gram matrix, and hence the error performance, is a function
of just the M components of p, and this is true irrespective of
the values of J and J 0 .
Our next result applies Theorem 1 to obtain a simple form
of the optimal transmitter state when the signal energy is constrained. It also presents a state which enables communication
without error.

Since the function being maximized is concave, it is also a

also optimal under the inequality constraint (8).

along L from p⇤ to p⇤ . In particular, we can ﬁnd a state on L
with signal energy NS and equal or better performance than
that obtainable from p⇤ . Consequently, there is an optimal state
under the inequality constraint with signal energy exactly NS .
The best transmitter for 2-PSK is particularly straightforward.

An experimental implementation of this optimum 2-PSK performance using single-photon sources and linear optics is
proposed in [20]. For M > 2, it appears that closed-form
solutions for A and B appearing in the expression (28) for
the optimal state cannot be obtained, so recourse to numerical
evaluation becomes necessary. Figure 2 shows the optimum
error probability as a function of NS obtainable from the
state (28) for various values of M . For comparison, the error
probability obtainable from a coherent state transmitter is also
shown.

Lemma 1. The optimum transmitter state under the inequality

p⌫ = 1 is achieved at p⇤ =

(1/M, . . . , 1/M ). Denote the p of an optimal state under the
inequality constraint by p⇤ , and its signal energy by Ns  NS .
Consider the line segment L joining p⇤ to p⇤ . Since the signal
energy is a linear in p, L contains states of signal energy
ranging from Ns to (M 1)/2. Further, since the function
PM 1 p
p⌫ is a concave function of p whose maximum is
⌫=0
attained at p⇤ , the function must be nondecreasing as we move

B. Pure-State Transmitters with a Combined Energy Constraint
In contrast to the foregoing, we may wish to constrain, as a
measure of the entire resources involved in state preparation,
the average energy in the signal and ancilla modes combined
without restricting either individually, i.e., we may impose the
constraint

states satisfying either of two physically relevant forms of
energy constraint. From a theoretical viewpoint, we have thus
completely solved a constrained channel discrimination problem. From a more practical viewpoint, our results, obtained
under the assumption of no loss, are likely to be useful in phase
sensing and quantum reading where typical loss levels are not
very high. For future work, it is highly desirable to study
the performance of M -PSK in the presence of loss. Some
of our conclusions, such as the inefﬁcacy of entanglement
and multiple signal modes, and also the possibility of zeroerror communication, are not expected to hold when loss is
taken into account [19], but the material here is essential to a
comprehensive analysis of a realistic lossy system.

for a given number N , and ask which state satisfying this
constraint minimizes the error probability. This constraint is
clearly more restrictive than a signal energy constraint of N .
However, we have shown in Section II.A that the optimum
pure-state transmitter for a signal energy constraint of N is
a signal-only state of energy N . Since this state also has
combined energy N , it remains the optimum state under the
combined energy constraint.
C. Mixed-State Transmitters

Finally, we extend the optimality of (28) to mixed-state
transmitters. We actually prove a stronger result.

In (32), the right-hand side represents the optimum performance under the conditions of the theorem statement and the
inequality holds because the performance given by the lefthand side is obtained when knowledge of j is ignored by the
⇤
receiver [21]. | j iS is the state of the form of (19) with the
same p as | j iAS , denoted pj , and (33) holds by Theorem 1.
P
In (34), | iS is the state of the form (19) with p = j ⇡j pj ,
and the inequality is true because P e of (23) is a sum of
convex functions of p [23], and hence convex itself. None of
the state transformations above has increased the signal (or
combined) energy from that of ⇢AS , so that | iS is a pure
state with energy bounded by N . By the results of Section
II.A-B, it cannot beat the optimum pure state | opt iS of (28)
with energy N .
III. C ONCLUSION
We have introduced a model for M -ary phase shift keying
using quantum states of light and, using a simple criterion
that clusters states in classes of equivalent performance, have
obtained the best transmitter state optimized over all possible
