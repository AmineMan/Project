Cb be the subcode of C which contains all order two codewords
and let κ be the dimension of (Cb )X , which is a binary linear
code. For the case α = 0, we will write κ = 0. Considering
all these parameters, we will say that C, or equivalently C =
Φ(C), is of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ).
Deﬁnition 1: Let C be a Z2 Z4 -additive code, which is a
subgroup of Zα ×Zβ . We say that the binary image C = Φ(C)
2
4
is a Z2 Z4 -linear code of binary length n = α + 2β and type
(α, β; γ, δ; κ), where γ, δ and κ are deﬁned as above.
The generator matrix for a Z2 Z4 -additive code C of type
(α, β; γ, δ; κ) can be written in the following standard form
[1]:

Abstract—Following [5], given a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code,
one can easily extend this code and generate an extended Z2 Z4 additive self-dual code with greater length. In this communication we study these constructions and check if properties like
separability and code Type are retained or not.
Keywords-Self-dual codes, Z2 Z4 -additive codes, separability.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We denote by Z2 and Z4 the ring of integers modulo 2 and
modulo 4, respectively. A binary linear code is a subspace of
Zn . A quaternary linear code is a subgroup of Zn .
2
4
In [3] Delsarte deﬁnes additive codes as subgroups of the
underlying abelian group in a translation association scheme.
For the binary Hamming scheme, the only structures for the
abelian group are those of the form Zα ×Zβ , with α +2β = n
2
4
[2]. Thus, the subgroups C of Zα × Zβ are the only additive
2
4
codes in a binary Hamming scheme which were ﬁrst deﬁned
in [6] and then later deeply studied in [1].
As in [4] and [1], we deﬁne an extension of the usual Gray
map. We deﬁne Φ : Zα × Zβ −→ Zn , where n = α + 2β,
2
2
4
given by Φ(x, y) = (x, φ(y1 ), . . . , φ(yβ )) for any x ∈ Zα
2
and any y = (y1 , . . . , yβ ) ∈ Zβ , where φ : Z4 −→ Z2 is the
2
4
usual Gray map, that is, φ(0) = (0, 0), φ(1) = (0, 1), φ(2) =
(1, 1), φ(3) = (1, 0).
Since C is a subgroup of Zα × Zβ , it is also isomorphic to
2
4
an abelian structure Zγ ×Zδ . Therefore, C is of type 2γ 4δ as a
4
2
group, it has |C| = 2γ+2δ codewords and the number of order
two codewords in C is 2γ+δ . Let X (respectively Y ) be the
set of Z2 (respectively Z4 ) coordinate positions, so |X| = α
and |Y | = β. Unless otherwise stated, the set X corresponds
to the ﬁrst α coordinates and Y corresponds to the last β
coordinates. Call CX (respectively CY ) the punctured code of
C by deleting the coordinates outside X (respectively Y ). Let

where T , T1 , T2 , R, S are matrices over Z2 and S is a matrix
over Z4 . Let 0 be the all-zero vector or matrix. The dimension
of these vectors or matrices will be clear from the context.
The Hamming weight of a vector vX ∈ Zα is the number
2
of its nonzero coordinates and it is denoted by wtH (vX ).
The Hamming distance between two vectors vX , uX ∈ Zα
2
is the number of coordinates in which vX and uX differ
from one another, and it is denoted by dH (vX , uX ). The
Lee weights of 0, 1, 2, 3 ∈ Z4 are 0, 1, 2, 1 respectively.
The Lee weight of a vector vY = (v1 , . . . , vβ ) ∈ Zβ
4
is then wL (vY ) =
wL (vi ). The Lee Distance between
i

vY , uY ∈ Zβ is dL (vY , uY ) = wtL (vY − uY ). For a vector
4
v = (vX , vY ) ∈ Zα × Zβ , deﬁne the weight of v, denoted
2
4
by wt(v), as wtH (vX ) + wtL (vY ) and for v, u ∈ Zα × Zβ
2
4
deﬁne the distance as d(v, u) = wt(v − u).
The map Φ is an isometry which transforms distances in
α+2β
Zα × Zβ to Hamming distances in Z2
.

If C = C ⊥ , then we say that C is a self-dual code. If C ⊆ C ⊥ ,
meaning all vectors are orthogonal to each other, then we say
that C is self-orthogonal. If C = φ(C), the binary code Φ(C ⊥ )
is denoted by C⊥ and called the Z2 Z4 -dual code of C. Z2 Z4 additive self-dual codes were studied in [5].
Let C be a Z2 Z4 -additive code. If C = CX × CY , then C is
called separable. If C is a separable Z2 Z4 -additive code, then
the generator matrix of C in standard form is

In either case we have [C : Cv ] = [Cv : C] and Cv = C, v .
Let w be a vector such that C = Cv , w . We can then write

¯
of uY . If C is not self-dual we may need to add more vectors
to the code. In all cases we let uX and uY be 0 if u ∈ Cv

and we denote by Cv the extension of Cv . Since C = Cv , w ,
¯ = Cv , w .

we denote C
Theorem 2: [5] If C is a Z2 Z4 -additive code of type
(α, β; γ, δ; κ) and v ∈ C. Let w, Cv be as before and
/
⊥
C = Cv = C, v, w . There exists a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual
¯
code D = C, V of type (α + α , β + β ; γ , δ ; κ ), for some
set of vectors V with the following conditions :
(i) α = 0 and β = 0 only if [v, w] = 2 and [v, v] ∈ {0, 2}.
(ii) α = 0 and β = 0 only if [v, w] = 2 or [v, w] ∈ {1, 3}
and [v, v] ∈ {1, 3}.
(iii) α = 0 and β = 0.
Let C be a Z2 Z4 -additive code and v ∈ C. We deﬁne
oC (v) = | C, v |/|C|. Note that oC (v) is not the order of v.
In fact, oC (v) ∈ {2, 4} and oC (v) = 2 if and only if 2v ∈ C.
Similarly, for a set of vectors V such that V ∩ C = ∅, we
deﬁne oC (V ) = | C, V |/|C|. Note that, by deﬁnition, if C is
a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code, v ∈ C and w ∈ C such that
C = Cv , w , then

Deﬁnition 2: A binary code C is antipodal if for any
codeword c ∈ C, we have c + 1 ∈ C. If C is a Z2 Z4 -additive
code then we say that C is antipodal if Φ(C) is antipodal,
where Φ(C) is the binary image of C.
Deﬁnition 3: If a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code has odd
weights, then it is said to be of Type 0. If the code has only
even weights then we say that the code is of Type I and if the
code has only doubly even weights then it is a Type II code.
In [5] it is proven that if C is a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code
then the following statements hold:
(i) C is antipodal if and only if C is Type I or Type II.
(ii) If C is separable then C is antipodal.
Therefore a Type 0 code is non-antipodal and non-separable.
A Type I or Type II code is antipodal and separable or nonseparable.
Theorem 1: [5] Let C be a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code of
type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) with α, β > 0.
(i) If C is Type 0, then α ≥ 2, β ≥ 2.
(ii) If C is Type I and separable, then α ≥ 2, β ≥ 1.
(iii) If C is Type I and non-separable, then α ≥ 4, β ≥ 4.
(iv) If C is Type II, then α ≥ 8, β ≥ 4.
The following table combines all the results given above for
Type 0, I and II codes.

Next we extend the quaternary coordinates. Let v ∈ C

that [v, w] = 2. Deﬁne vY = (1, 1) and wY = (2, 0).
By Lemma 1, oC (V ) = 1 and hence V = ∅. By using

are α = 4 + 2a and β = 4 + b, a, b ≥ 0.

Finally, the code C5 generated by the matrix G5 is a Z2 Z4 additive self-dual code of type (8, 4; 6, 1; 4). The code C5 is a

code C3 with generator matrix G3 of type (4, 6; 4, 2; 2). It is

We start by extending the binary coordinates ﬁrst. Let v ∈ C

such that [v, v] = 2 and we select w ∈ C\Cv such that
[v, w] = 2. Deﬁne vX = (0, 1) and wX = (1, 1). By
Lemma 1, oC (V ) = 1 and hence V = ∅. By using the

Hence the extended code generated by a Type I code C
using the method described above, both extending the binary
or the quaternary coordinates, will generate a Type I separable
code if C is separable and non-separable if C is non-separable.
D. Extending a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual Type II code
Let C be a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual Type II code. By Table
I, the possible values of α and β are α = 8+8a and β = 4+4b,
a, b ≥ 0.
We start by extending the binary part ﬁrst. Let v ∈ C
/
such that [v, v] = 2 and we select w ∈ C\Cv such that
[v, w] = 2. Deﬁne vX = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1) and wX =
(0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1). By Lemma 1, oC (V ) = 3 and hence V =
¯
(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0).
By using the technique described earlier we can extend the
code C of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) and obtain a new Z2 Z4 -additive
¯
self-dual code C which is of type (α + 8, β; γ , δ ; κ ).
Example 5: We consider the Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code
C4 generated by G4 . We can extend the binary coordinates by selecting v = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 0) and w =
(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1 0) along with the vX , wX and V given
¯
above. The extended Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code C4 with
¯
generator matrix G4 has type (16, 4; 10, 1; 8). It is separable
and is of Type II.

Take the Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code C3 generated by
G3 . We can extend the binary coordinates by selecting v =
(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1) and w = (1, 0, 1, 0 2, 0, 0, 0) along
with the vX and wX given above. The extended Z2 Z4 -additive
¯
¯
self-dual code C3 , with generator matrix G3 , obtained by
extending the binary coordinates of C3 has type (6, 4; 5, 1; 3).
It is non-separable and is of Type I

Now we extend the quaternary part. Let v ∈ C such that
/
[v, v] = 2 and we select w ∈ C\Cv such that [v, w] = 2.
Deﬁne vY = (1, 1) and wY = (2, 0). By Lemma 1, oC (V ) =
¯
1 and hence V = ∅. By using the technique described earlier
we can extend the code C of type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) and obtain a
¯
new Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code C which is of type (α, β +

In this communication, we studied the code extension
technique described in [5] for Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual codes.
The following theorem summarizes our results.
Theorem 3: If C is a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code of type
(α, β; γ, δ; κ) then given the proper choices of vX , wX , vY ,
wY and V , one can extend the length of the code C and obtain
¯
a new Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code C of type (α + α , β +
¯ κ) preserving both the Type and separability or nonβ ; γ , δ; ¯
¯
separability.

We consider the Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code C5 generated by G5 . We can extend the quaternary coordinates
by selecting v = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 0, 0, 0, 1) and w =
(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1 1, 1, 1, 1) along with the vY , wY and V
given above. When we extend the quaternary coordinates of
¯
¯
C5 we get a Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code C5 matrix G5 of type
(8, 8; 8, 2; 4). It is non-separable and is of Type II.

Hence, the extended code generated by a Type II code
C, using the method described above and both extending the
binary or the quaternary coordinates, will generate a Type II
separable code if C is separable and non-separable if C is nonseparable.

Now we will extend the quaternary part of a Z2 Z4 -additive
self-dual non-separable code. Again let C be a Z2 Z4 -additive
self-dual code of Type II. Let v ∈ C such that [v, v] = 1
/
and we select w ∈ C\Cv such that [v, w] = 1. Deﬁne vY =
(1, 1, 1, 0) and wY = (1, 1, 1, 1). By Lemma 1, oC (V ) = 2,
¯
hence we select V = {(0, 0, 2, 2, 0), (0, 2, 2, 0, 0)}. If C is of
type (α, β; γ, δ; κ) then by extending the code C we get a new
¯
code C which is of type (α, β + 4; γ , δ ; κ ).
Example 6: We consider the Z2 Z4 -additive self-dual code
C4 generated by G4 . We can extend the quaternary coordinates
by selecting v = (0, 2, 1, 0) and w = (3, 1, 3, 1) along
with the vY , wY and V given above. The extended Z2 Z4 ¯
¯
additive self-dual code C4 with generator matrix G4 has type
(16, 4; 10, 1; 8). It is separable and is of Type II.
