assumed to be an event, and P is completely determined
by the probability of the singletons.
The second special case is a Borel probability
(Rn , B (Rn ) , P), where B (Rn ) denotes the class of Borel
subsets of Rn . P can then be speciﬁed by a probability
distribution, or, if the distribution is sufﬁciently smooth,
by the probability density function p : Rn → [0, ∞) leading
to P(E) = p(x) dx.

Abstract—A stochastic system is deﬁned as a probability triple.
Models often require a coarse event sigma-algebra. A notion that
emerges in this setting is constrained probability, a concept that
is reminiscent but quite distinct from conditional probability.

I. I NTRODUCTION
By an ‘open’ system we mean a model that explicitly
incorporates the inﬂuence of the environment, but as an
unmodeled feature. Open systems can be interconnected with
other systems.
Our interest in this article is in systems with as outcome
space a (ﬁnite or) countable set, or Rn . If the event space
consist of all subsets of the countable outcome space, or of
the Borel sets in the case of Rn , then we call the σ -algebra
of events ‘rich’, in contrast to ‘coarse’ σ -algebras. In classical
stochastic systems, the event σ -algebra is assumed to be rich.
The event σ -algebra is an intrinsic, not to be ignored, feature
of the stochastic phenomenon that is modeled.
The article functions completely within the orthodox measure theoretic setting of probability, with a σ -algebra of events,
the mathematical framework of probability that is usually
attributed to Kolmogorov. The main point of this article is
basically pedagogical in nature, namely that the emphasis
in the teaching of probability on settings where essentially
every subset of the outcome space is an event is unduly
restrictive, even for elementary applications. Concepts, as
linearity, interconnection, and constrained probability, function
comfortably only within the context of coarse σ -algebras.
This conference paper is a summary of a full article [1] that
has recently been submitted.

E

For a classical stochastic system ‘essentially every’ subset of
W is an event and is assigned a probability. Thus for classical
stochastic systems, the events are obtained from the structure
of the outcome space. No probabilistic modeling enters in the
speciﬁcation of the events.
We illustrate the relevance of coarse σ -algebras by means
of a physical example. In Section VII, we will discuss a binary
channel .
A noisy resistor. Consider a 2-terminal electrical circuit shown
as a black box in Figure 3(a). The aim is to model the relation
between the voltage V and the current I. A deterministic
example is an Ohmic resistor, shown in Figure 3(b), described
by V = RI with R the resistance.

II. S TOCHASTIC SYSTEMS
Deﬁnition 1: A stochastic system is a triple (W, E , P) with
W a non-empty set, the outcome space, with elements of
W called outcomes,
E a σ -algebra of subsets of W, with elements of E are
called events,
P : E → [0, 1] a probability measure on E .
We assume that E and P satisfy the standard Kolmogorov
axioms.
Two important special cases are obtained as follows. We
refer to these special cases as classical stochastic systems.
The ﬁrst special case is (W, 2W , P) with W a countable
set. P can then be speciﬁed by giving the probability p
of the individual outcomes, p : W → [0, 1], and deﬁning
P by P(E) = Σ p(e). In this case, every subset of W is

As an example of a noisy circuit, consider a resistor with
thermal noise, as shown in Figure 3(c). In the deterministic
case, the resistor is modeled by V = RI, while in the stochastic
case, it is assumed that the outcomes (V, I) belong to strips
parallel to the line V = RI with a certain probability. More
concretely, for a Johnson-Nyquist resistor, it is assumed that
the probability that (V, I) belongs to the incremental strip x ≤

Deﬁnition 2: Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld, or R. The stochastic
system (Fn , E , P) is said to be linear if there exists a linear
subspace L of Fn such that the events consist of all subsets of
the quotient space Fn /L when F if a ﬁnite ﬁeld, or of the Borel
subsets of Fn /L when F = R. Fn /L is a ﬁnite dimensional
vector space over F of dimension = n − dimension(L). L is
called the ﬁber and dimension(L) the number of degrees of
freedom of the linear stochastic system.
The idea behind Deﬁnition 2 is illustrated in Figure 4. The
events are cylinders in Rn with rays parallel to the ﬁber L.
A linear stochastic system is classical if and only if L = {0}.
Hence a classical random vector with W = Fn deﬁnes a linear
stochastic system. At the other extreme, when L = Fn , the
event set E becomes the trivial σ -algebra {0, Fn }.

Observe that the deﬁnition of linearity involves only the
event σ -algebra, but not the probability measure.

In this section we discuss interconnection. We consider
the situation illustrated in Figure 5 with the assumption that
the two interconnected systems are stochastically independent.
Note that interconnection comes down to imposing two distinct
probabilistic laws on the same set of variables. Is it possible to
deﬁne one law which respects both laws? As we shall see, this
is indeed possible, provided some regularity condition, called
‘complementarity’, holds.
Deﬁnition 3: Two σ -algebras E1 and E2 on W are said to be
complementary if for all nonempty E1 , E1 ∈ E1 , E2 , E2 ∈ E2

current source, I = V /R + ε with ε the current generated by
the noisy current source, taken to be gaussian, zero mean, and
with standard deviation σ ∼ T /R. Hence, whereas ε and ε
=
are classical random variables, V is not a classical random
I
vector. Only cylinders with rays parallel to V = RI (see Figure
2) are events that are assigned a probability. In particular, V
and I are not classical random variables. Indeed, the basic
model of a noisy resistor does not imply a stochastic law for
V or I, in the sense that V and I are not classical random
variables. The description in terms of the events 1 and their
probabilities describes the physics better than these equivalent
circuits.

[ E1 ∩ E2 = E1 ∩ E2 ] ⇒ [ E1 = E1 and E2 = E2 ] .
Two systems Σ1 = (W, E1 , P1 ) and Σ2 = (W, E2 , P2 ) are said
to be complementary if for all E1 , E1 ∈ E1 and E2 , E2 ∈ E2

[ E1 ∩ E2 = E1 ∩ E2 ] ⇒ [ P1 (E1 )P2 (E2 ) = P1 (E1 )P2 (E2 )] .
In words, complementarity of stochastic systems requires
that the intersection of two events, one from each of the
σ -algebras, determines the product of the probabilities of
the intersecting events uniquely, while complementarity of
the σ -algebras requires that the intersection determines the
intersecting sets uniquely.
It is readily proven that

and, furthermore, that complementarity of two stochastic systems is implied by complementarity of the associated σ algebras.
Deﬁnition 4: Let Σ1 = (W, E1 , P1 ) and Σ2 = (W, E2 , P2 ) be
stochastic systems and assume that they are complementary.
The interconnection of Σ1 and Σ2 , assumed stochastically
independent, denoted by Σ1 ∧ Σ2 , is deﬁned as the system

coarseness of the σ -algebras is essential for complementarity
in the case the W is countable. Assume that Σ1 = (W, 2W , P),
with W countable, is a classical stochastic system and that
Σ = (W, E , P ) is another stochastic system. Then the σ algebras associated with Σ1 and Σ2 can only be complementary
if E is trivial, that is, E = {0, W}. More generally, if
/
the stochastic systems Σ and Σ are complementary then
for E ∈ E , we have E ∩ W = E ∩ E = W ∩ E, and hence
P(E) = P(E)P (E) = P (E). Therefore the following zero-one
law must hold:

Σ1 ∧ Σ2 := (W, E , P),

[ E ∈ E ] ⇒ [ P(E) = P (E) = 0 or P(E) = P (E) = 1] .
]

⇒ [ E1 = 0 or E2 = 0] ,
/
/]

E := the σ -algebra generated by E1 ∪ E2 ,

This is a very restrictive condition on Σ . For example, if each
singleton has positive P-measure, then E = {0, W}.
/
We conclude that classical stochastic systems are models
of closed systems. These systems cannot be interconnected
with other systems. Open systems require a coarse σ -algebra.
This shows a serious limitation of the classical stochastic
framework, since interconnection is one of the basic tenets
of model building.

and P deﬁned through ‘rectangles’ by
P(E1 ∩ E2 ) := P1 (E1 )P2 (E2 ) for E1 ∈ E1 , E2 ∈ E2 .
The deﬁnition of the probability P for rectangles
{E1 ∩ E2 | E1 ∈ E1 , E2 ∈ E2 } uses complementarity in an essential way. E is the σ -algebra generated by these rectangles.
It is readily seen that the class of subsets of W that consist
of the union of a ﬁnite number of disjoint rectangles forms
an algebra of sets. The probability of rectangles deﬁnes
the probability of the union of a ﬁnite number of disjoint
rectangles. By the Hahn-Kolmogorov extension theorem, this
leads to a unique probability measure P on E .
Obviously, there holds E1 , E2 ⊆ E . Also, for E1 ∈ E1 and
E2 ∈ E2 , we have P(E1 ) = P(E1 ∩ W) = P1 (E1 ) and P(E2 ) =
P(W ∩ E2 ) = P2 (E2 ). Hence interconnection reﬁnes the event
σ -algebras and the probabilities. Note also that for E1 ∈ E1
and E2 ∈ E2 , P(E1 ∩E2 ) = P1 (E1 )P2 (E2 ) = P(E1 )P(E2 ). Hence
E1 and E2 are stochastically independent sub-σ -algebras of
E . This expresses that Σ1 and Σ2 model phenomena that are
stochastically independent.

VI. C ONSTRAINED PROBABILITY
Consider the stochastic system (W, E , P). Let S be a
nonempty subset of W. In this section we discuss the meaning
of the stochastic system induced by (W, E , P) with outcomes
constrained to be in S. We shall see that this is indeed a
sensible concept.
Deﬁnition 5: Let Σ = (W, E , P) be a stochastic system and
S ⊆ W. Assume that the regularity condition
[ E1 , E2 ∈ E and E1 ∩ S = E2 ∩ S] ⇒ [ P(E1 ) = P(E2 )]
]
]
holds. Then the stochastic system
Σ|S := (S, E |S , P|S )
E |S := {E ⊆ S | E = E ∩ S for some E ∈ E },

V. O PEN VERSUS CLOSED SYSTEMS

P|S (E ) := P(E) with E ∈ E such that E = E ∩ S,

As a general principle, it is best to aim for models that
are open, and a mathematical theory of modeling should
reﬂect this aspect from the very beginning. Models usually
leave some of the individual variables free, unexplained, and
merely express what one can conclude about a coupled set of
variables.
Consider for example the classical notion of an ndimensional stochastic vector process as a family of measurable maps ft : Ω → Rn ,t ∈ T (T denotes the time-set), from
a basic probability space Ω, with σ -algebra A , to Rn , with
σ -algebra B(Rn ). This is very much a closed systems view,
since once the uncertain parameter ω ∈ Ω has been realized,
the complete trajectory t ∈ T → ft (ω) ∈ Rn is determined.
Such models leave no room for the inﬂuence of the environment. Stochastic systems with a coarse σ -algebra do allow to
incorporate the unexplained environment.
Another way of looking at ‘open’ versus ‘closed’ systems is
by considering interconnection. An open stochastic system can
be interconnected with other systems, a closed system cannot
be interconnected (or, more accurately, it can only be interconnected with a trivial stochastic system). We illustrate that

is called the stochastic system Σ with outcomes constrained to
be in S.
The regularity condition basically implies S ∈ E . In fact,
/
if S ∈ E , then regularity holds if and only if w ∈ S with
probability 1, that is, if and only if P(S) = 1.
Note that constraining essentially corresponds to interconnecting (W, E , P) with the ‘deterministic’ system
(W, {0, S, Scomplement , W}, P ) with P (S) = 1. The regularity
/
condition corresponds to complementarity.
The notion of the stochastic system Σ with outcomes constrained to be in S, while reminiscent of the notion of the
stochastic system Σ conditioned on outcomes in S, is quite
distinct from it. The former basically requires S ∈ E , while the
/
latter requires S ∈ E . Secondly, constraining associates with
the event E ∈ E of Σ, the event E ∩ S of Σ|S with probability
P(E), while conditioning associates with the event E ∈ E of Σ
the event E ∩ S, also in E , with probability P(E ∩ S)/P(S). So,
constraining pulls the probability of E ‘globally’ into E ∩ S,
while conditioning associates with E ‘locally’ the probability
of E ∩ S, renormalized by P(S).

respectively. The sets S0 and S1 are illustrated in Figure 7(c).

Open stochastic systems are often thought of as classical
stochastic systems with ‘input’ parameters, that is, as a family
of probability measures on the output space, parameterized
by the input. Such families of probability measures go under the name of probability kernels. The main distinction
between probability kernels and our approach consists in the
input/output view of open systems that underlies probability
kernels. While inputs and outputs deﬁnitely have their place
in modeling, especially in signal processing and in feedback
control, the input/output view of systems has many drawbacks
when modeling open physical systems, as argued for example
in [2] for the deterministic case: a physical system is not a
signal processor. With input/output thinking one cannot get
off the ground when modeling, for example, simple electrical circuits [3], the paradigmatic examples of interconnected
systems.
Developing the themes of the present article using probability kernels in their full generality lies beyond our scope. We
now explain some of the connections between our notion of
stochastic system on the one hand, and probability kernels
on the other hand, by means of the binary channel. The

Binary channel

and Σsbc |S1 = (Y, 2Y , P|S1 ) with

channel functions as follows. There are two possible inputs,
u0 and u1 . The channel transmits the input and produces two
possible outputs, y0 and y1 . The input u0 leads to output y0
with probability p0 and to y1 with probability 1 − p0 , while
the input u1 leads to output y1 with probability p1 and to
y0 with probability 1 − p1 . If p0 = p1 = p, then we call the
channel symmetric, while if p0 = p1 , then we call the channel
asymmetric. The symmetric binary channel is shown in Figure
6(a), while the asymmetric binary channel is shown in Figure
6(b).
Formally, denote the input alphabet as U = {u0 , u1 } and the
output alphabet as Y = {y0 , y1 }. The channel is speciﬁed as
two classical stochastic systems,
Σu0 = Y, 2Y , Pu0

and

P|S1 (y0 ) = 1 − p, P|S0 (y1 ) = p.
Observe that Σsbc |S0 and Σsbc |S1 yields precisely the systems
Σu0 and Σu1 that specify the channel as a probability kernel.
Note that the symmetric binary channel can be viewed
as a linear stochastic system. Identify both U and Y with
GF(2), the Galois ﬁeld {0, 1}. Set W = U × Y = GF(2)2 .
Then Σsbc is a linear stochastic over the ﬁeld GF(2) with
ﬁber L = {(0, 0), (1, 1)} and probabilities P(L) = p and
P((0, 1) + L) = 1 − p.
B. The asymmetric binary channel
We next show how to approach the asymmetric binary
channel from our point of view. We start with the system

Σu1 = Y, 2Y , Pu1 ,

Σabc = (U × Y × E, E , P)

with the probabilities determined by

with E = {e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 }. Thus the outcome space, shown in
Figure 8(a), is the Cartesian product of U×Y and E. The space
E is introduced in order to generate the channel uncertainty.
The events E consist of the σ -algebra generated by

Pu0 (y0 ) = p0 , Pu0 (y1 ) = 1 − p0 , Pu1 (y0 ) = 1 − p1 , Pu1 (y1 ) = p1 .
The pair of systems Σu0 , Σu1 is a probability kernel.
A. The symmetric binary channel

E1 = {(u0 , y0 , e1 ), (u1 , y0 , e1 )},

We show how to approach the symmetric binary channel
using constrained probability. We start with the system

E2 = {(u0 , y0 , e2 ), (u1 , y1 , e2 )},

Σsbc = (U × Y, E , P).

E4 = {(u0 , y1 , e4 ), (u1 , y1 , e4 )}.

E3 = {(u0 , y1 , e3 ), (u1 , y0 , e3 )},

4

The generating set for E is shown in Figure 8(b). Note
that the σ -algebra generated by {E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 } is not equal
to 2U×Y×E . Σabc is not a classical stochastic system. The
probability P is determined by
P(E1 ) = p0 (1 − p1 ),

P(E2 ) = p0 p1 ,

P(E3 ) = (1 − p0 )(1 − p1 ),

The introduction of E and Σabc shows that the speciﬁcation
of a channel as a probability kernel can be interpreted in a very
natural way as constrained stochastic systems. The probability
kernel can also be interpreted in terms of conditional probabilities by deﬁning, for π ∈ [0, 1], Pu (u0 ) = π and Pu (u1 ) = 1 − π.
We then obtain stochastic systems with Σu0 and Σu1 the
conditional probabilities of y given u. Since the interpretation
of the probability kernel as conditional probabilities requires
modeling the environment, that is, interpreting the input u as
a classical random variable, we feel that the interpretation in
terms of constrained probability is a more satisfactory one
conceptually.
When ε a classical random vector, then y = f (u, ε) can
be dealt with by considering u as an input parameter which
together with ε generates the output y. For example, the
symmetric binary channel can be realized this way by taking
U = Y = {0, 1}, ε a random variable taking values in {0, 1}
with Pε (0) = p, Pε (1) = 1− p, and setting u+y = ε over GF(2).
The asymmetric binary channel can be realized by setting
U = Y = {0, 1}, and y = ε0 (1−u)+ε1 u with ε0 , ε1 independent
random variables both taking values in {0, 1} with P(ε0 = 0) =
p0 and P(ε1 = 1) = p1 . In terms of the e’s discussed above,
we have then e1 ↔ (0, 0), e2 ↔ (0, 1), e3 ↔ (1, 0), e4 ↔ (1, 1).

P(E4 ) = (1 − p0 )p1 .

Now consider the stochastic system Σabc with outcomes
constrained to be in
S0 = {(u, y, e) | u = u0 } and S1 = {(u, y, e) | u = u1 },
respectively. The sets S0 and S1 are illustrated in Figure 8(c).
It is easily veriﬁed that the regularity condition of Deﬁnition 5
is satisﬁed for both S0 and S1 . The resulting stochastic systems
are Σabc |S0 = (Y × E, E |S0 , P|S0 ) with E |S0 generated by
E1 = {(y0 , e1 )},

E2 = {(y0 , e2 )},
