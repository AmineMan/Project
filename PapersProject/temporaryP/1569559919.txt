In this paper, we consider a macrodiversity MIMO multiple
access channel (MIMO-MAC) where all sources and receive
antennas are widely separated and all links experience independent Rayleigh fading. For this system, we consider the
ergodic sum capacity, under the assumption of no channel
state information (CSI) at the transmitters. We derive an
approximation to capacity which is very accurate, but the functional form is awkward to interpret. Hence, a simple bound is
developed which leads to insight into capacity behavior and
its relationship with the channel powers.
The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. Section II
describes the system model and Secs. III and IV develop
accurate approximations and bounds on capacity. Results and
conclusions appear in Secs. V and VI.

Abstract—The prospect of base station cooperation has led to
increased interest in macrodiversity systems, where both sources
and receive antennas are geographically distributed. In this
scenario, little is known about channel capacity since the channel
matrices have a very general form where each path may have
a different power. Hence, in this paper we consider the ergodic
sum capacity of a macrodiversity MIMO system with arbitrary
numbers of sources and antennas operating over Rayleigh fading
channels. For this system, we compute a compact approximation
to ergodic sum capacity, which is shown to be very accurate
over a wide range of cases. Finally, we develop a highly simpliﬁed
upper-bound which leads to insights into the relationship between
capacity and the channel powers.

I. I NTRODUCTION
With the advent of network multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) [1] and base station (BS) collaboration [2], it is
becoming more common to consider MIMO links where the
receive array, transmit array or both are widely separated. In
these scenarios, individual antennas from a single effective
array may be separated by a considerable distance. When both
transmitter and receiver have distributed antennas, we refer
to the link as a macrodiversity MIMO link. Little is known
analytically about such links, despite their growing importance
in research [3]-[4] and standards where coordinated multipoint
transmission (CoMP) is part of 3GPP LTE Advanced.
Some analytical progress in this area has been made recently
in the analysis of linear combining for macrodiversity systems
[5], [6]. However, there appears to be little work currently
available on the capacity of general systems of this type.
Similar work includes the capacity analysis of two-sided
correlated Rayleigh channels [7] and the asymptotic macrodiversity results in [8] which gives a range of useful results
and approximations. Also, there is work on system capacity
for particular cellular structures, including Wyner’s circular
cellular array model [3] and the inﬁnite linear cell-array model
[4]. Despite these contributions, the general macrodiversity
model is difﬁcult to handle. The analytical difﬁculties are
caused by the geographical separation of the antennas which
results in entries of the channel matrix having different powers
with an arbitrary pattern.

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
Consider a MIMO-MAC uplink with M base stations and
K users operating over independent Rayleigh channels where
BS i has nRi receive antennas and user i has ni antennas. The
M
total number of receive antennas is denoted nR = i=1 nRi
and the total number of transmit antennas is denoted N =
K
i=1 ni . The system equation is given by
r = Hs + n ,

(1)

where r is the C nR ×1 receive vector, s is the combined C N ×1
transmitted vector from the K users, n is an additive white
Gaussian noise vector, n ∼ CN 0 , σ 2I , and H ∈ C nR ×N
is the composite channel matrix containing the K channel
matrices from the K users. If no CSI at the transmitters is
assumed, the corresponding ergodic sum capacity is [9]

where E |si |2 = 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N , is the power of
each transmitted symbol1 . It is convenient to label each
column of H as h i for i = 1, 2, . . . , N . The covariance
matrices of h k are deﬁned by P k = E h kh H where

the capacity equation is simply 1/σ 2 . The results can also be
extended to cover correlated channels, which may result from
users or BSs having co-located antennas. This extension will
appear in the forthcoming journal version of this paper.

In this section, we derive an extremely simple upper-bound
for the ergodic capacity in (2). This provides a simpler
relationship between the average link powers and ergodic sum
capacity at the expense of a loss in accuracy. Using Jensen’s

and α > 0 is the parameter controlling the uniformity of the
powers across the antennas. Note that as α → 0 the received
power is dominant at the ﬁrst location, as α becomes large
(α
1) the third location is dominant and as α → 1 there
is an even spread. Using these parameters, four scenarios
are given in Table I for the case of two single antenna
users. In Fig. 1, we explore the capacity of scenarios S1S4 where nR = 3. The approximation in (25) is shown
to be extremely accurate. All capacity results are extremely
similar except for S1, where both sources have their dominant
path at the ﬁrst receive antenna. Here, the system is largely
overloaded (two strong signals at a single antenna) and the
performance is lower. The similarity of S3 and S4 is interesting
as they represent very different systems. In S3, the two users
are essentially separate with the dominant channels being at
different antennas. In S4, both users have power equally spread
over all antennas.
Figure 2 shows results for a random drop scenario (see [6])
with nR = 6, M = 3, K = N = 6. In each random drop,
uniform random locations, lognormal shadow fading and path
loss are considered where σSF = 8dB (standard deviation of
shadow fading) and the path loss exponent is 3.5. The transmit
power of the sources is scaled so that all locations in the
coverage area have a maximum received SNR at the three BSs
greater than 3dB, at least 95% of the time. Hence, each drop
produces a different P matrix and independent channels are

We consider three distributed BSs with either a single
receive antenna or two antennas. For a two-source system,
we parameterize the system by three parameters [5], [6].
The average received signal to noise ratio is deﬁned by
ρ = PT /σ 2 . In particular, for a two-source system, ρ =
P

ratio is deﬁned by ς = Tr (P 1 ) /Tr (P 2 ). The spread of the
signal power across the three BS locations is assumed to be
exponential, so that a range of possibilities can be covered
with one parameter. The exponential proﬁle is deﬁned by

of the simple Jensen bound. However, the bound is quite
reasonable over the whole SNR range. The low and high SNR
approximations become reasonable at more widely spread
SNR values. For example, the low SNR results are accurate
below -5 dB and the high SNR results are poor until around
15 dB. Hence, although there is a noticeable capacity error at
high SNR, the cross-product coefﬁcients in (28) are seen to
explain the large majority of the ergodic capacity behavior.

In this paper, we have studied the ergodic sum capacity of a
Rayleigh fading macrodiversity MIMO-MAC. The approximations have a simple form and are shown to be very accurate
over a wide range of channel powers. In addition, a simple
upper bound is presented which demonstrates the importance
of various channel power cross products in determining capacity. The mathematical approach to random matrices having
an arbitrary power structure may well have applications in
multivariate statistics and other areas.

assumed. So that the different drops are comparable, each P
matrix is scaled so that the total power, PT , is constant for each
drop. The excellent agreement between the approximation in
(25) and the simulations in Fig. 2 is encouraging as this
demonstrates the accuracy of (25) over different system sizes
as well as over completely different sets of channel powers.
In Figs. 1 - 2, at low SNR the capacity is controlled by
PT . Hence, since ρ = PT /σ 2 , all four drops have similar
performance at low SNR and diverge at higher SNR where the
channel proﬁles affect the results. In Fig. 3, the upper bound
is shown for a random drop with M = nR = 6, K = N = 6.
High and low SNR approximations are also shown. The results
clearly show the loss in accuracy resulting from the use
