symmetric memoryless channel (BSC) and a binary erasure
channel (BEC) [10].
The method is applicable for any BICM setup with soft- or
hard-decision demapping. As opposed to [1]–[6], it does not
require deep insight into the channel code properties, such as,
e.g., its weight distribution spectrum, as it is based only on the
IPC of the coding scheme, which in turn can be derived from
its BER performance over the binary-input AWGN channel.
Exemplarily, we consider BICM of amplitude-shift keying
(ASK) transmitted over the AWGN and a log-normal fading
channel using convolutional codes in combination with softinput Viterbi decoding [11], and LDPC codes with belief
propagation decoding [12].
Following a brief review of the principle of IPCs in Sec. II,
the BICM-ASK setup and the proposed method of IPCbased performance estimation are presented in Sec. III. The
effectiveness of our approach is compared to simulation results
in Sec. IV; a discussion of the method concludes the paper.

Abstract—Information processing characteristics (IPC) provide a general framework for the analysis of a coding scheme. In
this paper, we utilize IPCs to obtain performance estimates for the
end-to-end coded channel for bit-interleaved coded modulation
(BICM) using a given modulation format and coding scheme, i.e.,
its bit error rate and capacity. The proposed method enables to
fully decouple the analysis of the coding scheme from the analysis
of the higher-order modulation scheme and delivers very good
performance estimates. Exemplarily, this is validated by means of
numerical simulations for BICM using convolutional- and LDPCcoded amplitude-shift keying.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is a pragmatic
approach to coded modulation and, due to its ﬂexibility, robustness, and simplicity, is the de-facto standard for modern coded
digital transmission systems [1], [2]. It is thus of particular
interest to estimate the performance of BICM in combination
with a given modulation format and coding scheme, i.e.,
channel code, encoder, and corresponding decoder.
In case of hard-input channel decoding, typically bit error
rate (BER) processing characteristics of the coding scheme are
sufﬁcient, i.e., based on the uncoded BER of the communication channel the BER of the coded channel can be estimated.
However, coding schemes signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from reliability information on the decoder input symbols; soft-decisions
should be fed to the channel decoder. In this case, more elaborate methods to predict the BER of the end-to-end (coded)
channel are required, typically based on (reﬁnements of) the
union bound [1]–[6]. In this paper, we present a method,
which is based on the principle of information processing
characteristics (IPC) [7]–[9]. It exploits the mutual information
of the communication channel and the characteristics how
the channel decoder processes the available information at
its input. Based on the BICM capacity of the communication
channel between encoder and decoder, we derive an estimate
for the capacity of the end-to-end channel from encoder input
to decoder output. This capacity estimate is then translated
into an estimate for the coded BER using two well-known
bounds based on modeling the end-to-end channel as a binary

II. I NFORMATION P ROCESSING C HARACTERISTICS
We consider the generic transmission system depicted in
the top part of Fig. 1, consisting of a channel encoder, a
binary-input soft-output communication channel, and a channel decoder. Without restriction of generality, we assume the
information symbols1 u at the encoder input as independent
equiprobable binary symbols. The encoder of rate Rc = k/n
encodes k information symbols into a codeword of n binary
code symbols x, which is transmitted over the communication
channel to be detailed later. Given the received symbols v,
which represent estimates of the code symbols (reliability
information or hard decisions), the decoder estimates the transmitted information. Here, we restrict to hard-output decoders,
i.e., u are from the same (binary) alphabet as u.
ˆ
The concept of IPCs provides a general framework for
the analysis of the performance of this coding scheme [7],
[9], [14]. As opposed to the commonly used end-to-end
performance measure average bit error rate (i.e., BERcode =

omit explicit symbol/time indices, where it does not impair clarity.

OF

BICM

In this section, we show how accurate estimates for the
performance of the end-to-end coded transmission chain are
obtained using IPCs. Exemplarily we consider the case that
the communication channel represents BICM of ASK [1], [2],
but note that the proposed method can be transferred to any
modulation format.

An ideal encoder/decoder pair achieves Ccode = 1, as long
as the entropy of X, H(X) = Rc , does not exceed the capacity
Cch of the communication channel, and otherwise degrades
linear [7], i.e.,
IPCideal = min(Cch /Rc , 1) .

A. BICM for ASK-Transmission
In a BICM setup, as depicted in the bottom part of Fig. 1,
the code symbols x are interleaved and partitioned into touples
b of log2 (M ) code symbols, which are mapped to amplitude
coefﬁcients a taken from an M -ary bipolar ASK signal con2
stellation A with variance σa . The mapping is speciﬁed by a
bijective binary labeling rule M : b ∈ {0; 1}log2 (M) → a ∈ A
(e.g., Gray or set-partition labeling); the overall rate of the
BICM setup is denoted as R = Rc log2 (M ). After transmission using conventional digital pulse-amplitude modulation
(PAM) [11], the receive symbols are given as the amplitude
coefﬁcient scaled by a fading coefﬁcient h and corrupted by
2
additive Gaussian noise n with variance σn , i.e.,

(3)

Since for most non-ideal coding schemes an analytical
expression for the IPC does not exist, IPCs have to be
obtained by simulation [7]. As IPCs depend only on the
capacity of the underlying channel, this can be done by
simulation of BPSK transmission over an AWGN channel.
Depending on the investigated coding scheme, two options for
the communication channel have to be considered. For softinput channel decoding, v represent reliability information, and
the capacity of the communication channel is given as the
constellation-constraint capacity of BPSK transmitted over an
AWGN channel. For hard-input channel decoding, v represent
hard-decisions on the code symbols, and Cch is given as the
capacity of a BSC with equivalent BER = E{Pr{X = V }}.
In both cases, assuming the errors introduced by the decoder
follow a memoryless process2 , the mutual information of the
overall channel can be estimated from the simulated BERcode
via Ccode = 1 − e2 (BERcode ).
Fig. 2 shows the IPCs of rate-1/2 coding schemes over the
binary-input AWGN channel for a maximum-free distance
convolutional code (constraint length ν = 4, nonsystematic
encoding) with soft-input Viterbi decoding [11] (left) and an
LDPC code from the WLAN-802.11n standard [15] (systematic encoding, codeword length n = 648) with soft-input

y = ha + n .

(4)

As a measure for the quality of the communication channel, we
consider the ratio of the transmitted energy per ASK symbol
Es over the one-sided noise power-spectral density N0 ; thus,
2
2
we have Es /N0 = σa /(2σn ). The receiver performs a demapping operation V, which computes reliability information for
the code symbols based on the received symbol, e.g., the
probability Pr{B = 0|Y } (= 1−Pr{B = 1|Y }), or equivalent
metrics, which are deinterleaved and fed to the decoder.
The capacity of the BICM-ASK transmission is given as the
sum of the bit level capacities I(Bµ ; Y ) [1], [16], [17], i.e.,
in bit per PAM channel use we have

For brevity, the dependence on the applied binary labeling rule
and Es /N0 is omitted where possible.
For comparison, we also consider the case when the communication channel represents BICM-ASK with a hard-decision
demapper, i.e., V decides for the most likely transmitted
ˆ
symbol a and hence the corresponding bit label b. The capacity

decoder output are a memoryless process, such that the overall
channel represents a BSC. The second bound is an upper
bound and is based on the contrary assumption, i.e., the errors
are concentrated in a single burst [10]. In summary, the BER
of the overall channel of the BICM setup is bounded by

Chard = log2 (M ) · (1 − e2 (BERunc ))

However, it has to be emphasized that the bounds are tight
only in case of ideal interleaving. The performance can be
better than the lower bound, if the interleaver size is ﬁnite,
and thus the errors follow a process with arbitrary-structured
memory. This argument is conﬁrmed by the fact that memory
increases capacity [13], [18].
Finally, we note that in case of hard-input decoding, i.e.,
using (6) in (7), the lower bound is equivalent to directly using
BER processing characteristics.

where BERunc = E{Pr{X = V |Y }} denotes the average
bit error rate of the communication channel (which is easily
calculated for M -ASK with given labeling rule).
B. Estimating the Capacity of the End-to-End Channel
Due to the interleaver in the BICM setup, the ideal BICM
communication channel can be seen as a binary memoryless
channel with average capacity Cch = CBICM / log2 (M ) per
communication channel use [7]. Thus, the capacity per use of
the coding channel from the input of the encoder to the output
of the (hard-output) decoder can be expressed as
IPC
Ccode (Es /N0 ) = IPCcode (Cch (Es /N0 ))

IV. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
Fig. 4 depicts the estimated capacities of the coded channel
IPC
in bit per PAM channel use, i.e., Ccode ·R, for different coding
schemes with 4-, 8-, and 16-ASK for an AWGN channel
(h = 1). We spend one bit redundancy per ASK symbol
(Rc = 1/2 for 4-, 2/3 for 8-, and 3/4 for 16-ASK) and
consider the following coding schemes: 1) on the left hand side
of Fig. 4: maximum-free-distance convolutional codes with
constraint length ν = 4 (interleaver size 10.000 symbols)
in combination with soft-input Viterbi decoding (blue), 2) on
the right hand side of Fig. 4: the LDPC code from WLAN802.11n (codeword length and interleaver size n = 648) in
combination with soft-input BP decoding (blue), and 3) in
both plots the ideal coding scheme (red). For Rc = 1/2,
the IPCs of the coding schemes are shown in Fig. 2. These
results are compared to the capacity of uncoded transmission
(gray) obtained from (6), scaled by a factor of Rc to enable
comparison. It can be observed, that the capacity of an ideal
coding scheme follows the BICM capacity up to the point
where Ccode R < R and then delivers the maximum possible
mutual information of R bit per ASK symbol. The capacity of
the convolutional coding schemes with soft-input decoding is
superior to uncoded transmission at about 1 dB (10 dB, 17 dB)
for 4-(8-, 16-)ASK; note that using this method with hardinput decoding estimates a loss of approx. 2 dB (not shown).
The systematically encoded LDPC coding scheme always
achieves better performance than uncoded transmission.
The BERcode -estimates obtained from the bounds given
in (8) are shown in Fig. 5 for the setting considered above
(solid/dashed: lower/upper bound, left/right hand side of (8)).
For the ideal coding scheme, only the lower bound is given,
which coincides with the rate-distortion-capacity bound. For
comparison simulation results of BICM-ASK transmission are
also shown (markers). Especially the lower bound agrees well
with the simulation results and thus delivers quite accurate
estimates for the BER performance of the BICM system
Noteworthy, the results are accurate in the entire SNR regime,
different from approaches based on the union bound, which
are often useless at low SNR [5], [6]. Of course, relative

where IPCcode is the IPC of the applied encoder/decoder-pair,
as deﬁned in (1). Multiplying the estimated capacity with the
overall rate of the modulation R translates it into units of bit
per use of the PAM channel and enables comparison to the
BICM capacity of ASK, cf. (5).
Exemplarily, Fig. 3 demonstrates this procedure for Graylabeled 4-ASK and the rate-1/2 convolutional code shown in
Fig. 2. For each ratio Es /N0 (here 3 dB) the average BICM
capacity is processed through the IPC of the convolutional
code; the output is the estimated capacity of the coded channel
per binary information symbol. For comparison, the IPC and
the resulting capacity of an ideal coding scheme are shown.
C. Estimating the Bit Error Rate of the End-to-End Channel

estimate for the bit error rate of the coding channel, BERcode .

statements valid for the capacity translate into the same
statements on the BER performance, since both bounds are
monotonic functions. E.g., the use of convolutional codes is
favorable over uncoded transmission for Es /N0 larger than
1 dB, 10 dB, and 17 dB for 4-, 8-, and 16-ASK, respectively.

the concatenated coding scheme operates with highest powerefﬁciency (basically, this is an explanation for the excellent
performance of the concatenation of an inner rate-1/2 convolutional code and an outer high-rate Reed-Solomon code,
e.g., in the NASA standard [21]). If set-partition labeling is
applied, the optimum outer rate is slightly larger compared
to Gray-labeling. For the systematically encoded LDPC codes
this optimum is attained at zero rate. However, for 4-ASK,

For sake of completeness, results for 4-ASK subject to lognormal fading (parameterized such that 20 log10 (|H|) is independent, identical Gaussian distributed with variance 6 dB)
are provided in Fig. 6. The BICM capacity has been averaged
over the fading distribution prior to using IPCs.

Translating the capacity of the coding channel as a function
of Es /N0 into a capacity-curve plotted vs. Eb /N0 , where
IPC
Eb = Es /Ccode is the energy per information bit, one obtains
estimates for the power efﬁciency of the coded system. Fig. 7
depicts these curves for ASK transmission with Gray (left) and
set-partition labeling (right) for the coding schemes considered
above. Note that BICM-ASK with an ideal coding scheme
is not wideband optimal with Gray-labeling, whereas it is
ﬁrst-order-optimal with set-partition labeling [19], [20]; for
the non-ideal coding schemes, neither Gray, nor set-partition
labeling are wideband optimal. In case of nonsystematically
encoded convolutional codes, the minimum ratio Eb /N0 is
attained at non-zero rate (indicated with a marker). These
points indicate an optimum operating point for an additional
outer coding scheme.Selecting the outer code rate accordingly,

V. D ISCUSSION AND C ONCLUSIONS
The intention of the proposed method is to provide goodmatching estimates for the end-to-end performance of BICM
transmission using a given modulation format (i.e., constellation, labeling rule, and channel model), and coding scheme
(i.e., channel code, encoder, and corresponding decoder).
To this end, we consider IPCs as a powerful tool for the
analysis. The main beneﬁt of the proposed method is the
fact, that the analysis of the channel coding scheme and
the analysis of BICM for higher-order modulation schemes
can be fully decoupled. It is thus sufﬁcient to evaluate two
independent building blocks of BICM, the BICM capacity of
the modulation scheme Cch and the IPC of the coding scheme
IPCcode . Modeling the end-to-end channel from encoder input
to decoder output as a BSC, a very good BER estimate is given
by combining these two modules according to
BERcode (Es /N0 ) = e−1 (1 − IPCcode (Cch (Es /N0 ))) . (9)

Consequently, the vast amount of research on channel coding
for the binary-input AWGN channel can directly be translated
to analyze BICM of higher-order modulation. Especially for
complex BICM setups, which may include fading scenarios, as
well as different kinds of detectors, the proposed method leads
to signiﬁcant reduction in computational complexity, since
assessing the coded system performance can be decoupled
from simulation of the uncoded transmission chain.
The drawbacks of the proposed method are its non-closedform results, the required accuracy for computing the IPC
of the coding scheme and the BICM capacity (both directly
related to the region of interest for the BER), as well as the
fact that it relies on an ideal interleaver in the BICM setup.
Optimizing of BICM using different kinds of interleavers
(optimized or none at all), as, e.g., performed in [22], can not
be covered. However, if BICM is applied in fading scenarios,
as commonly envisioned, this drawback becomes irrelevant.
