        <papertitle>Data Processing Lower Bounds for Scalar Lossy Source Codes with Side Information at the Decoder</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we derive lower bounds on the distortion of scalar fixed-rate codes for lossy compression with side information available at the receiver. These bounds are derived by presenting the relevant random variables as a Markov chain and applying generalized data processing inequalities a la Ziv and Zakai.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Graph-based Code Design for Quadratic-Gaussian Wyner-Ziv Problem with Arbitrary Side Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Wyner-Ziv coding (WZC) is a compression technique using decoder side information, which is unknown at the encoder, to help the reconstruction. In this paper, we propose and implement a new WZC structure, called residual WZC, for the quadratic-Gaussian Wyner-Ziv problem where side information can be arbitrarily distributed. In our two-stage residual WZC, the source is quantized twice and the input of the second stage is the quantization error (residue) of the first stage. The codebook of the first stage quantizer must be simultaneously good for source and channel coding, since it also acts as a channel code at the decoder. Stemming from the non-ideal quantization at the encoder, a problem of channel decoding beyond capacity is identified and solved when we design the practical decoder. Moreover,by using the modified reinforced belief-propagation quantization algorithm, the low-density parity check code (LDPC), whose edge degree is optimized for channel coding, also performs well as a source code. We then implement the residual WZC by an LDPC and a low-density generator matrix code (LDGM). The simulation results show that our practical construction approaches the Wyner-Ziv bound. Compared with previous works, our construction can offer more design flexibility in terms of distribution of side information and practical code rate selection.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Source Coding With Delayed Side Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>For memoryless sources, delayed side information at the decoder does not improve the rate-distortion function. However, this is not the case for more general sources with memory, as demonstrated by a number of works focusing on the special case of (delayed) feedforward. In this paper, a setting is studied in which the side information is delayed and the encoder is informed about the side information sequence. Assuming a hidden Markov model for the sources, at first, a single-letter characterization is given for the set-up where the side information delay is arbitrary and known at the encoder, and the reconstruction at the destination is required to be (near) lossless. Then, with delay equal to zero or one source symbol, a single-letter characterization is given of the rate-distortion function for the case where side information may be delayed or not, unbeknownst to the encoder. Finally, an example for a binary source is provided.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Compression Algorithm Using Mis-aligned Side-information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the problem of compressing a source sequence in the presence of side-information that is related to the source via insertions, deletions and substitutions. We propose a simple algorithm to compress the source sequence when the side-information is present at both the encoder and decoder. A key attribute of the algorithm is that it encodes the edits contained in runs of different extents separately. For small insertion and deletion probabilities, the compression rate of the algorithm is shown to be asymptotically optimal.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Construction of MIMO MAC Codes Achieving the Pigeon Hole Bound</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper provides a general construction method for multiple-input multiple-output multiple access channel codes (MIMO MAC codes) that have so called generalized full rank property. The achieved constructions give a positive answer to the question whether it is generally possible to reach the so called pigeon hole bound, that is an upper bound for the decay of determinants of MIMO-MAC channel codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On The Sum-Capacity of Gaussian MAC With Peak Constraint</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; This paper addresses a two-user Gaussian Multiple Access Channel (MAC) under peak constraints at the transmitters. It is shown that generating the code-books of both users according to discrete distributions achieves the largest sum-rate in the network. In other words, sum-capcity achieving input distributions for this channel are discrete with a finite number of mass points. We also demonstrate uniqueness of the input distributions which achieve rates at any of the corner points of the capacity region of the channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Expurgation for Discrete Multiple-Access Channels via Linear Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the error exponent of the memoryless multiple-access (MAC) channel. We show that if the MAC channel is modulo-additive, then any error probability, and hence any error exponent, achievable by a linear code for the corresponding single-user channel, is also achievable for the MAC channel. Specifically, for an alphabet of prime cardinality, where linear codes achieve the best known exponents in the single-user setting (and the optimal exponent above the critical rate), this performance carries over to the MAC setting. At least at low rates, where expurgation is needed, our approach strictly improves performance over previous results, where expurgation was used at most for one of the users. Even when the MAC channel is not additive, it may be transformed into such a channel. While the transformation is lossy, we show that the distributed structure gain in some ``nearly additive'' cases outweighs the loss, and thus we can improve upon the best known exponent for these cases as well. This approach is related to that previously proposed for the Gaussian MAC channel, and is based on ``distributed structure''.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Simpler Achievable Rate Regions for Multiaccess with Finite Blocklength</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Although practical communication networks employ coding schemes with blocklengths as low as several hundred symbols, classical information theoretic setups consider blocklengths approaching infinity. Building upon information spectrum concepts and recent work on channel dispersion, we develop a non-asymptotic inner bound on as well as a low-complexity, second-order achievable rate region for a discrete memoryless multiple access channel with a given finite blocklength and positive average error probability. Our bounds appear to capture essentially the same region as those of Tan and Kosut, but are less computationally complex because they require only the means and variances of the relevant mutual information random variables instead of their full covariance matrix.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Two Unicast Wireless Networks with Destination-to-Source Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we study the role of feedback in layered two unicast wireless networks with arbitrary number of nodes and connectivity. The feedback model allows destinations to feedback their received signals to their respective sources. In the case of linear deterministic networks, we fully characterize the capacity region when the two individual minimum cut values are equal to 1 and show that feedback only helps increase capacity whenever the capacity region without feedback has (1,1/2) or (1/2,1) as its corner point but not both. Therefore, feedback helps balance the resource utilization of the two users, similar to the role of feedback in the two-user interference channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Degrees of Freedom of Layered Two Unicast Networks with Delayed CSIT</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we study the two unicast information flow problem over layered Gaussian networks with arbitrary number of nodes and connectivity, under the model of delayed channel state information (CSI) at transmitters and instantaneous CSI at receivers. We show that similar to the case with instantaneous CSI at transmitters (CSIT), the degrees of freedom (DoF) region is strictly larger than the time-sharing DoF region if and only if there is no omniscient node, definition of which only depends on the topology of the network. Moreover, as in the case with instantaneous CSIT, 2/3 DoF per user is always achievable when there is no omniscient node in the network.</abstract>

        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot;. In this paper, we study the sum secure degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of two-unicast layered wireless networks. Without a secrecy constraint, the sum d.o.f. of this class of networks was studied by [1] and shown to take only one of three possible values: 1, 3/2 and 2, for all network configurations. We consider the setting where the message of each source-destination pair must be kept information-theoretically secure from the unintended receiver. We show that the sum secure d.o.f. can take 0,1,3/2,2 and at most countably many other positive values, which we enumerate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Approximate Ergodic Capacity of a Class of Fading 2-user 2-hop Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a fading AWGN $2$-user $2$-hop network where the channel coefficients are independently drawn from continuous distributions and vary over time. For a broad class of channel distributions, we characterize the ergodic sum capacity within a constant number of bits/sec/Hz, independent of signal-to-noise ratio. The achievability follows from the analysis of an interference neutralization scheme where the relays are partitioned into $K$ pairs, and interference is neutralized separately by each pair of relays. When $K=1$, the proposed ergodic interference neutralization characterizes the ergodic sum capacity within $4$ bits/sec/Hz for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform phase fading and approximately $4.7$ bits/sec/Hz for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading. We further show that this gap can be tightened to $4((\log\pi)-1)\simeq 2.6$ for i.i.d. uniform phase fading and approximately $3.1$ for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading in the limit of large $K$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Broadcast Channels with Confidential Messages by Randomness Constrained Stochastic Encoder</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In coding schemes for the wire-tap channel or the broadcast channels with confidential messages, it is well known that the sender needs to use a stochastic encoding to avoid the information about the transmitted confidential message to be leaked to an eavesdropper. In this paper, it is investigated that the trade-off between the rate of the random number to realize the stochastic encoding and the rates of the common, private, and confidential messages. For the direct theorem, the superposition coding scheme for the wire-tap channel recently proposed by Chia and El Gamal is employed, and its strong security is proved. The matching converse theorem is also established. Our result clarifies that a combination of the ordinary stochastic encoding and the channel prefixing by the channel simulation is suboptimal.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Secrecy Is Cheap if the Adversary Must Reconstruct</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A secret key can be used to conceal information from an eavesdropper during communication, as in Shannon's cipher system. Most theoretical guarantees of secrecy require the secret key space to grow exponentially with the length of communication. Here we show that when an eavesdropper attempts to reconstruct an information sequence, as posed in the literature by Yamamoto, very little secret key is required to effect unconditionally maximal distortion; specifically, we only need the secret key space to increase unboundedly, growing arbitrarily slowly with the blocklength. As a corollary, even with a secret key of constant size we can still cause the adversary arbitrarily close to maximal distortion, regardless of the length of the information sequence.</abstract>

        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&#13;
&#13;
In a point-to-point communication system which consists of a sender s, a receiver t and a set of noiseless channels, the sender s wants to transmit a private message to the receiver t through the channels which may be eavesdropped by a wiretapper. The wiretapper can access any one but not more than one set of channels. It is assumed that from each wiretap set, the wiretapper can obtain some partial information about the private message which is measured by the wiretapper's equivocation. The security strategy is to encode the message with some random key. Under these settings, we define an achievable rate tuple in terms of the message, the key and the wiretapper's equivocation and prove a tight rate region of the rate tuples.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Strong Secrecy in Compound Broadcast Channels with Confidential Messages</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper the compound broadcast channel with confidential messages is studied, where it is only known to the transmitter and receivers that the actual channel realization is fixed and from a pre-specified set of channels. An achievable rate region for the strong secrecy criterion is derived. Further, a multi-letter outer bound is given, which establishes, together with the achievable rate region, a multi-letter expression of the strong secrecy capacity region.</abstract>

        <abstract>We generalize the list decoding algorithm for Hermitian codes proposed by Lee and O'Sullivan based on Gröbner bases to general one-point AG codes, under an assumption weaker than one used by Beelen and Brander. By using the same principle, we also generalize the unique decoding algorithm for one-point AG codes over the Miura-Kamiya $C_{ab}$ curves proposed by Lee, Bras-Amorós and O'Sullivan to general one-point AG codes, without any assumption. Finally we extend the latter unique decoding algorithm to list decoding, modify it so that it can be used with the Feng-Rao improved code construction, prove equality between its error correcting capability and half the minimum distance lower bound by Andersen and Geil that has not been done in the original proposal, and remove the unnecessary computational steps so that it can run faster.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present an algorithm for list decoding codewords of algebraic number field codes in polynomial time. This is the first explicit procedure for decoding number field codes whose construction were previously independently described by Lenstra and Guruswami. We rely on a new algorithm for computing the Hermite normal form of the basis of an OK-module due to Biasse and Fieker where OK is the ring of integers of a number field K.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Lifting Decoding Scheme and its Application to Interleaved Linear Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we design a decoding algorithm based on a lifting decoding scheme. This leads to a unique decoding algorithm with complexity quasi linear in all the parameters for Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings and a list decoding algorithm. We show that, using erasures in our algorithms, allows one to decode more errors than half the minimum distance with a high probability. Finally we apply these techniques to interleaved linear codes over a finite field and obtain a decoding algorithm that can recover more errors than half the minimum distance.</abstract>

        <abstract>Poset metrics form a generalization of the Hamming metric on the space F_q^n. Orbits of the group of linear isometries of the space give rise to a translation association scheme. The structure of the dual scheme is important in studying duality of linear codes; this study is facilitated if the scheme is self-dual. We study the relation between self-duality of the scheme and that of the poset. We also give new examples of poset metric spaces and compute orbits of the isometry groups of the metric spaces defined by them.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Uncertainty of Information Retrieval in Associative Memories</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We (people) are memory machines. Our decision processes, emotions and interactions with the world around us are based on and driven by associations to our memories. This natural association paradigm will become critical in future memory systems, namely, the key question will not be ``How do I store more information?'' but rather, ``Do I have the relevant information? How do I retrieve it?''&#13;
&#13;
The focus of this paper is to make a first step in this direction. We define and solve a very basic problem in associative retrieval. Given a word W, the words in the memory that are t-associated with W are the words in the ball of radius t around W. In general, given a set of words, say W, X and Y, the words that are t-associated with {W,X,Y} are those in the memory that are within distance t from all the three words. Our main goal is to study the maximum size of the t-associated set as a function of the number of input words and the minimum distance of the words in memory - we call this value the uncertainty of an associative memory. We derive the uncertainty of the associative memory that consists of all the binary vectors with an arbitrary number of input words. In addition, we study the retrieval problem, namely, how do we get the t-associated set given the inputs? We note that this paradigm is a generalization of the sequences reconstruction problem that was proposed by Levenshtein (2001). In this model a word is transmitted over multiple channels. A decoder receives all the channel outputs and decodes the transmitted word. Levenshtein computed the minimum number of channels that guarantee a successful decoder - this value happens to be the uncertainty of an associative memory with two input words.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On q-ary antipodal matchings and applications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We define a q-ary antipodal matching to be a perfect matching in the bipartite graph with vertices corresponding to words of length l over the integer alphabet Q = { 0, 1, ..., q-1 }, wherein the left and right vertices are those with respective component sums greater and smaller than l(q-1)/2, and wherein two vertices are connected by an edge if one of the corresponding words dominates the other. We present two different constructions of efficiently computable q-ary antipodal matchings. We then show how such matchings can be used for encoding arbitrary data into n x n arrays over the alphabet Q all of whose row and column sums are at most n(q-1)/2. Such encoders might be useful for mitigating parasitic currents in a next generation memory technology based on crossbar arrays of resistive devices.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Family of q-ary Codes Obtained From a Substructure of Generalised Hadamard Matrices</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this article we construct an infinite family of linear error correcting codes over GF(q) for any prime power q. The codes are a generalisation of an optimal family of binary self-complementary codes that are usually obtained from quasi-symmetric designs. Here the codes are obtained by considering a sub-matrix of a specially constructed generalised Hadamard matrix. The optimality of the family is confirmed by using a recently derived generalisation of the Grey-Rankin bound and the Griesmer bound.</abstract>

        <papertitle>High-Rate Sparse Superposition Codes with Iteratively Optimal Estimates</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Recently sparse superposition codes have been developed which are fast and reliable at any rate below the channel capacity for the additive white Gaussian noise channel with power control. We substantially improve on the performance using soft decision decoders with Bayes optimal statistics at each iteration of the decoder, followed by thresholding only at the final step. This presentation includes formulation of the statistics and their distributions, numerical simulations of the performance improvement, and some useful identities in the analysis. These identities relate a squared error risk to a posterior probability of error and provide unbiased estimation of this risk.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Capacity of the Multi-MMSE Constrained Gaussian Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We examine codes, over the additive Gaussian noise channel, designed for for reliable communication at some specific signal-to-noise ratio(snr) and constrained by the permitted MMSE at K lower snrs. Extending the result of the single MMSE constrained code, we show that K-layers superposition codes attain the constrained capacity. Moreover, we prove that given a reliable code attaining the MMSE constrained capacity, its MMSE and mutual information, as functions of snr, are completely defined. Thus, no other MMSE constrained capacity achieving code has better MMSE performance at unconstrained snrs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Expurgated Infinite Constellations at Finite Dimensions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We revisit the setting of a Gaussian channel without power constraints, proposed by Poltyrev, where the codewords are points in Euclidean space and their density is considered instead of the communication rate. We refine the expurgation technique (proposed by Poltyrev for the derivation of the error exponent) to the finite dimensions case and obtain a finite-dimensional achievability bound. While the expurgation exponent improves upon the random coding exponent only for certain rates, we show that for finite dimensions the expurgation technique is useful for a broader range of rates. In addition, we present precise asymptotical analysis of the expurgation bound and find the sub-exponential terms, which turn out to be non-negligible.</abstract>

        <abstract>We determine the loss in capacity incurred by using signal constellations with a bounded support over general complex-valued additive-noise channels for suitably high signal-to-noise ratio. Our expression for the capacity loss recovers the power loss of 1.53dB for square signal constellations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Optimum Strategies for Minimizing the Exponential Moments of a Loss Function</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a general problem of minimizing the exponential moment of a given loss function, with an emphasis on the relation to the more common criterion of minimization the first moment of the same loss function. Our basic observation is about simple sufficient conditions for a strategy to be optimum in the exponential moment sense. This observation is useful and application examples are given. We also examine the asymptotic regime and investigate universal asymptotically optimum strategies in light of the aforementioned sufficient conditions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the equivalence between Stein identity and de Bruijn identity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper illustrates the equivalence between two fundamental results: Stein identity, originally proposed in the statistical estimation realm, and de Bruijn identity, considered for the first time in the information theory field. Two distinctive extensions of de Bruijn identity are presented as well. For arbitrary but fixed input and noise distributions, the first-order derivative of differential entropy is expressed by means of a function of the posterior mean, while the second-order derivative of differential entropy is manifested in terms of a function of Fisher information. Several applications exemplify the utility of the proposed results.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Minimization of Entropy Functionals Revisited</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Integral functionals based on convex normal integrands are minimized subject to finitely many moment constraints. The integrands are strictly convex but need not be autonomous or differentiable. The effective domain of the value function is described by a modification of the concept of convex core. The main results assume a dual constraint qualification but dispense with the primal constraint qualification. Minimizers and generalized minimizers are explicitly described whenever the primal value is finite. Existence of a generalized dual solution is established whenever the dual value is finite. A generalized Pythagorean identity is presented using Bregman distance and a correction term. Results are applied to minimization of Bregman distances.</abstract>

        <abstract>The convergence of the Shannon entropy in the countable infinity case is revisited and extended in this work. New results are presented that provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of the entropy in different settings, including scenarios with both finitely and infinitely supported measures. These results show some connections between the Shannon entropy convergence and the convergence in information divergence.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Sphere Packing Bound for Quantum Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, the Sphere-Packing-Bound of Fano, Shannon, Gallager and Berlekamp is extended to general classical-quantum channels. The obtained upper bound for the reliability function, for the case of pure state channels, coincides at high rates with a lower bound derived by Burnashev and Holevo. Thus, for pure state channels, the reliability function at high rates is now exactly determined. For the general case, the obtained upper bound expression at high rates was conjectured to represent also a lower bound to the reliability function, but a complete proof has not been obtained yet.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Quantum error-correcting codes over finite fields have been widely studied, but quantum codes over rings have been left largely unexplored. This paper introduces stabilizer codes over finite Frobenius rings and establishes their connection to classical code. Structural properties of stabilizer codes over finite Frobenius rings are established. It is proved that free stabilizer codes over finite commutative chain rings cannot outperform stabilizer codes over finite fields.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Nice Nearrings</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Nice error bases are a fundamental primitive of quantum information processing. For example, they govern the discretization of errors in quantum error-correcting codes. It is show that the generalized Pauli basis, the most widely used example of nice error bases, has some remarkable structural properties. However, the generalized Pauli basis is limited to dimensions that are a power of a prime, since it is constructed with the help of a finite field. A wider class of nice error bases is introduced that shares many features of the generalized Pauli basis, yet allows one to remove the restriction to prime power dimensions. The nice error bases are indexed by nearrings. Nearrings that support the construction of nice error bases are called nice. It is shown that all finite nearfields are nice. It is shown that a finite ring is nice if and only if it finite Frobenius ring. Several fundamental properties of nice nearrings are established.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Continuing Part I, we present the (uju + v) construction applied to asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes (AQECC). Additionally, as the second purpose of the whole paper, we apply the quantum code expansion developed in Part I, in order to construct new families of asymmetric quantum codes derived from generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) codes, quadratic residue (QR), Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), character codes and affine-invariant codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A General Formula of Rate-Distortion Functions for Source Coding with Side Information at Many Decoders</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Heegard and Berger introduced the model of lossy source coding in which side information is available at many decoders. For this model, their showed an upper bound of the rate-distortion function in the case where the source is stationary memoryless. In this paper, we extend their model to the case where the source may be nonstationary and/or nonergodic, and clarify the rate-distortion function for this model. This result is based on the information-spectrum method introduced by Han and Verdú. We also show some special cases of the rate-distortion function, and a single-letterized upper bound of the rate-distortion function in the case where the source is stationary memoryless.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Heegard-Berger Problem with Common Reconstruction Constraints</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In lossy source coding with side information at the decoder (i.e., the Wyner-Ziv problem), the estimate of the source obtained at the decoder cannot be generally reproduced at the encoder, due to its dependence on the side information. In some applications this may be undesirable, and a Common Reconstruction (CR) requirement, whereby one imposes that encoder and decoder be able to agree on the decoder's estimate, may be instead in order. The rate-distortion function under the CR constraint has been recently derived for the point-to-point (Wyner-Ziv) problem. In this paper, this result is extended to the Heegard-Berger (HB) problem and to its variant with cooperating decoders. Specifically, for the HB problem, the rate-distortion function is derived under the assumption that the side information sequences at the two decoders are stochastically degraded. The rate-distortion function is also calculated explicitly for the special case of binary source and erased side information with Hamming distortion metric. The rate-distortion function is then characterized also for the HB problem with cooperating decoders and physically degraded side information.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Distributed and Cascade Lossy Source Coding with a Side Information &quot;Vending Machine&quot;</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Source coding with a side information &quot;vending machine&quot; is a recently proposed framework in which the statistical relationship between the side information available at the decoder and the source sequence can be controlled by the decoder based on the message received from the encoder. In this paper, the characterization of the optimal rate-distortion performance as a function of the cost associated with the control actions is extended from the previously studied point-to-point set-up to two multiterminal models. First, a distributed source coding model is studied, in which two encoders communicate over rate-limited links to a decoder, whose side information can be controlled based on the control actions selected by one of the encoders. The ratedistortion- cost region is characterized under the assumption of lossless reconstruction of the source encoded by the node that does not control the side information. Then, a three-node cascade scenario is investigated, in which the last node has controllable side information. The rate-distortion-cost region is derived for general distortion requirements and under the assumption of &quot;causal&quot; availability of side information at the last node.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Information Masking and Amplification: The Source Coding Setting</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The complementary problems of masking and amplifying channel state information in the Gel'fand-Pinsker channel have recently been solved by Merhav and Shamai, and Kim et al., respectively. In this paper, we study a related source coding problem. Specifically, we consider the two-encoder source coding setting where one source is to be amplified, while the other source is to be masked. In general, there is a tension between these two objectives which is characterized by the amplification-masking tradeoff. In this paper, we give a single-letter description of this tradeoff. &#13;
&#13;
We apply this result, together with a recent theorem by Courtade and Weissman on multiterminal source coding, to solve a fundamental entropy characterization problem.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multiple Description Coding Based Compress-and-Forward for the Broadcast Relay Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work, the broadcast relay channel (BRC) with one source, two destinations and a dedicated relay node is studied for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels. Unlike all the existing achievability schemes, which use decode-and-forward (DF) relaying for the BRC, the new achievability schemes are based on compress-and-forward (CF). Three different compression methods are proposed: naive, joint and multiple description coding based. In naive CF (nCF) and joint CF (jCF), the relay forms a single representation, conveying its observation to both destinations at a single quality level. On the other hand, in multiple description coding based CF (mdCF), the relay utilizes multiple description coding and forms two representations, which allows for the two destinations to receive the relay observation at different quality levels. Through Gaussian examples, it is observed that mdCF enlarges nCF and jCF rate regions. Moreover, mdCF is the only scheme, which can achieve both of the single user CF rates achievable in the constituent single user relay channels.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Broadcast Correlated Gaussians: the Vector-Scalar Case</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of sending a set of correlated Gaussian sources over a bandwidth-matched two-user scalar Gaussian broadcast channel is studied in this work, where the strong receiver wishes to reconstruct several source components (i.e., a vector source) under a distortion covariance matrix constraint and the weak receiver wishes to reconstruct a single source component (i.e., a scalar source) under the mean squared error distortion constraint. We provide a complete characterization of the optimal tradeoff between the transmitter power constraint and the achievable reconstruction distortion pair for this problem. The converse part is based on a new bounding technique which involves the introduction of an appropriate remote source. The forward part is based on a hybrid scheme where the digital portion uses dirty paper channel code and Wyner-Ziv source code. This scheme is different from the optimal scheme proposed by Tian et al. in a recent work for the scalar-scalar case, which implies that the optimal scheme for the scalar-scalar case is in fact not unique.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Quadratic Gaussian Source Broadcast with Individual Bandwidth Mismatches</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the problem of broadcasting a Gaussian source over a Gaussian broadcast channel to two users with individual source-channel bandwidth mismatches, under a quadratic distortion measure. Specifically we study the tradeoff between the achievable distortion pairs between the two users. The case when the bandwidth-expansion factors of the two users are identical has been well studied in the literature and to our best knowledge remains an open problem. Surprisingly, when the bandwidth expansion factors are different, we characterize a range of values where both the users simultaneously attain their point-to-point optimal distortion. Furthermore in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime, this set includes nearly all points where the weaker user has the higher bandwidth expansion factor. In other cases, we propose an achievable tradeoff between the distortion pairs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Broadcast Approach Under Mixed Delay Constraints</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This work considers the problem of transmitting two streams with different delay constraints over a single input single output slowly flat fading channel, where only the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI). One stream has stringent delay constraints, while the other stream has a relaxed delay constraint. This is modeled by a block fading channel for the first stream, where a broadcast approach is employed. The second stream is encoded over a longer block and views an ergodic fading channel. Several encoding and decoding strategies are considered. In all cases the delay constrained stream is decoded in presence of the other stream, which can be decoded only after its long codeword is fully received. The non-delay constrained part is decoded after canceling out the first stream from the received signal. We derive here a closed form solution for the optimal layering power distribution, which maximizes the expected sum-rate, where the layering is employed on the delay constrained stream.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Is Gaussian Noise the Worst-Case Additive Noise in Wireless Networks?</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. An important classical result in Information Theory states that the Gaussian noise is the worst-case additive noise in point-to-point channels. In this paper, we significantly generalize this result and show that, under very mild assumptions, Gaussian noise is also the worst-case additive noise in general wireless networks with additive noises that are independent from the transmit signals. More specifically, we prove that, given a coding scheme with finite reading precision for an AWGN network, one can build a coding scheme that achieves the same rates on an additive noise wireless network with the same topology, where the noise terms may have any distribution with same mean and variance as in the AWGN network.</abstract>

        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. In anonymous networks, a subset of nodes is chosen to act as covert relays to hide timing information from unauthorized observers. While such covert relays increase anonymity, they cause performance degradation by delaying or dropping packets. In this paper, we propose flow allocation methods that maximize anonymity for multipath wireless networks with predetermined covert relay nodes, while taking into account packet-loss as a constraint. Using a rate-distortion framework, we show how to assign probabilities which split the flows from source to destination among all possible routes and show that selecting routes according to the assigned probabilities achieves maximum anonymity given the packet-loss constraint.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Can geographic routing scale when nodes are mobile?</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; We begin by asking whether geographic routing can scale when nodes are mobile; that is, can the overhead involved in tracking node locations be accommodated within the transport capacity of large-scale mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)? We answer this question in the affirmative by proposing an efficient position publish protocol which fits within the transport capacity and a routing protocol that operates with imperfect information of the destination's location. The routing protocol guarantees, with high probability, routes whose lengths are within a constant &quot;stretch'' factor of the shortest path from source to destination. The key idea underlying the scalability of the publish protocol is for each potential destination node to send location updates (with frequency decaying with distance) only to a subset of network nodes, structured as annular regions around it (the natural approach of updating circular regions in distance dependent fashion does not scale). The routing protocol must then account for the fact that the source and/or relay nodes may not have estimates of the destination's location (or may have stale estimates). Spatial and temporal scaling of protocol parameters are chosen so as to guarantee scalability, route reliability and route stretch.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Asymptotically Optimal Push-Pull Method for Multicasting over a Random Network</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider multicast flow problems where either all of the nodes or only a subset of the nodes may be in session. Traffic from each node in the session has to be sent to every other node in the session. If the session does not consist of all the nodes, the remaining nodes act as relays. The nodes are connected by undirected edges whose capacities are independent and identically distributed random variables. We study the asymptotics of the capacity region (with network coding) in the limit of a large number of nodes, and show that the normalized sum rate converges to a constant almost surely. We then provide a decentralized push-pull algorithm that asymptotically achieves this normalized sum rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Broadcasting over Fading Wiretap Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Broadcasting over the fading wiretap channel is investigated, which does not have the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and is subject to a stringent delay constraint. A new broadcast approach is developed, which integrates secure superposition coding studied in the authors' previous work and embedded coding in a hybrid fashion. This scheme outperforms the previous performance for the cases when the eavesdropper's channel is fading. The secrecy rate achievable via the new broadcast approach is derived, and the structure of the optimal power allocation function across the secure coding layers is characterized via techniques for solving the problem of constrained calculus of variations. A notion of probabilistic secrecy is introduced and studied, which characterizes the probability that a certain secrecy rate is achieved for any given fading block. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the impact of the CSI at the transmitter and the channel fluctuation of the eavesdropper on the average secrecy rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Ergodic Secret Message Capacity of the Wiretap Channel with Finite-Rate Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the secret message capacity of an ergodic block fading wiretap channel with finite-rate feedback. We consider that in addition to the statistics of the main and the eavesdropper channel state information (CSI), the sender is provided by the legitimate receiver with a $q$-bit feedback, at the beginning of each coherence block, through an error-free public channel, with capacity $q$ bits. We establish inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity and show that a positive secrecy rate is achievable even when the feedback is at the end of each coherence block and $q=1$. We also show that the inner and the outer bounds coincide asymptotically as $q \rightarrow \infty$. Based on this asymptotic analysis, we provide a suboptimal scheme which also achieves a positive secrecy rate without the need of any numerical optimization, and which is optimal as $N \rightarrow \infty$. Finally, asymptotic analysis at high and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) are presented where it is found that the capacity is bounded at high-SNR, whereas it scales linearly with SNR at low-SNR regime. When applied to Rayleigh fading channels, we show that a 4-bit feedback achieves $90 \%$ of the secrecy capacity when perfect main CSI is available at the transmitter.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Capacity Region of Non-degraded Wiretap Channel with Noiseless feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The non-degraded wiretap channel with noiseless feedback is first investigated by R. Ahlswede and N. Cai, where a lower and upper bound on the secrecy capacity is provided in their work. However, the capacity region considering transmission rate and the equivocation to the wiretapper, has not been determined yet. In this paper, the capacity region is determined for the non-degraded wiretap channel with noiseless feedback. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity of this model is formulated, which provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Achievable Region for the Wiretap Multiple-Access Channel with Common Message</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We derive a rate region which is achievable by the Wiretap MAC with Common Message under the strong secrecy criterion. We follow Devetak's approach to establishing strong secrecy. Using the concentration of the normed sum of bounded i.i.d. random variables around its mean, it is possible to show the existence of a code where the channel outputs at the eavesdropper are almost independent of the messages. The encoders may use a certain amount of common randomness. We give the example of a channel where the availability of common randomness is necessary for secret transmission.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we construct new subcodes of the second-order binary Reed-Muller code by using the permutation group and by projecting the code onto codes with smaller parameters. The permutation group of Reed-Muller codes is the general affine group and can be decomposed into the semi-direct product of the translation group and the general linear group. The action of the translation group projects the second order Reed-Muller code onto copies of the first order Reed-Muller code. The general linear group projects the code onto codes for which we can control the useful length and the dimension. These parameters depend on the dimension of the eigenspace of the chosen element of the general linear group for the eigenvalue 1.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Spherically punctured biorthogonal codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider a binary Reed-Muller code RM$(r,m)$ defined on the full set of binary $m$-tuples and let this code be punctured to the spherical layer $S(b)$ that includes only $m$-tuples of a given Hamming weight $b.$ More generally, we can consider punctured RM codes RM$(r,m,B)$ restricted to some set $B$ of several spherical layers $S(b),b\in B$. In this paper we specify this construction for the biorthogonal codes RM$(1,m)$ and the Hadamard codes $H(m)$. It is shown that the overall weight of any code vector in a punctured code $H(m,B)$ is determined by the weight $w$ of its information block. More specifically, this weight depends only on the values of the Krawtchouk polynomials $K_{b}^{m}(w)$ for all $b\in B$. We further refine our codes by limiting the possible weights $w$ of the input information blocks. As a result, we obtain sequences of codes that meet or closely approach the Griesmer bound.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Multiplicative linear secret sharing schemes are the building blocks for multiparty computation protocols. Such schemes can be defined in terms of linear codes with an additional algebraic structure. We show that Reed-Muller codes have the required additional structure and we introduce a more general class of Reed-Muller type codes suitable for linear secret sharing and multiparty computation. The codes have highly structured generator and parity check matrices that can be used for very efficient implementations over the binary field.</abstract>

        <abstract>We show some sufficient conditions for a semisimple abelian code to be permutation decodable. We find non trivial partial PD-sets with respect to the information set introduced in [Bernal and Simon IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, vol. 57, n. 12 (2011)]. By using these results we present examples of permutation decodable abelian codes improving the bounds about the dimension given in [Shiva, Fung and Tan, IEEE Trans. Inform.

        <papertitle>On embedding conditions of shifts of finite type into the Fibonacci-Dyck shift</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the embedding problem for shifts of finite type into the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. First, we find the reflection principle does not hold for the path in the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. Then, we obtain the limit of a sequence of topological entropies of a class of irreducible $(d-1)$-step shifts of finite type of the Fibonacci-Dyck shift, where $d\,(\geq2)$ are even integers. This limit provide one of the embedding conditions for the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. Finally, we generalize the result on computing the above limit of a sequence of topological entropies to the Markov-Dyck shift.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Approximately Counting the Number of Constrained Arrays via the Sum-Product Algorithm</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Very often, constrained coding schemes impose nonlinear constraints on arrays and therefore it is usually nontrivial to determine how many arrays satisfy the given constraints. In this paper we show that there are non-trivial constrained coding scenarios where the number of constrained arrays can be estimated to a surprisingly high accuracy with the help of the sum-product algorithm, despite the fact that the underlying factor graphs have many short cycles, and we investigate the reasons why this is the case. These findings open up interesting possibilities for determining the number of constrained arrays also for scenarios where other counting and bounding techniques are not readily available.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Codes for Structured Bursts</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We introduce a technique for constructing codes for bursts of errors that have some known structure; for example bursts of length at most $b$ and Hamming weight at most $t$. This technique is based on modifying existing codes for generic bursts by replacing a portion of their check matrix with a more efficient one, in light of the additional constraints on the burst. We illustrate this procedure by modifying the Fire, Burton and Gilbert codes to address bursts with maximum Hamming weight, bursts with solid errors, or bursts with internal ``mini-bursts''. We provide evidence that the redundancy of the codes we construct can be very good through examples, one of which is optimal within the class of cyclic codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Erasure Coding for Real-Time Streaming</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a real-time streaming system where messages are created sequentially at the source, and are encoded for transmission over a packet erasure channel. Each message must subsequently be decoded at the receiver within a given delay from its creation time. We consider code design and maximum message rates when all messages must be decodable by their respective deadlines under a specified set of erasure patterns (erasure model). Specifically, we provide a code construction that achieves the optimal rate for an asymptotic number of messages, under erasure models containing a limited number of erasures per coding window, per sliding window, and containing erasure bursts of a limited length.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Capacity of Additive White Alpha-Stable Noise Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Many communication channels are reasonably modeled to be impaired by additive noise. Recent studies suggest that many of these channels are affected by additive noise that is best explained by alpha-stable statistics. We study in this work such channel models and we characterize the capacity-achieving input distribution for those channels under fractional order moment constraints. We prove that the optimal input is necessarily discrete with a compact support for all such channels. Interestingly, if the second moment is viewed as a measure of power, even when the channel input is allowed to have infinite second moment, the optimal one is found to have finite power.</abstract>

        <abstract>A very recent and new model describing communication based on the exchange of chemical molecules in a drifting liquid medium is investigated and new analytical upper and lower bounds on the capacity are presented. The bounds are asymptotically tight, i.e., if the average-delay constraint is loosened to infinity or if the drift velocity of the liquid medium tends to infinity, the corresponding asymptotic capacities are derived precisely.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Achievable Rates of Gaussian Channels with Realistic Duty Cycle and Power Constraints</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Many wireless communication systems are subject to duty cycle constraint, that is, a radio only actively transmits signals over a fraction of the time. For example, it is desirable to have a small duty cycle in some low-power systems; a half-duplex radio cannot keep transmitting if it wishes to receive useful signals; and a cognitive radio needs to listen to the channel frequently to detect primary users. Zhang and Guo have shown that the capacity of a Gaussian channel subject to an idealized duty cycle constraint as well as average transmission power constraint is achieved by discrete independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) on-off signaling in lieu of Gaussian signaling, which is optimal without the duty cycle constraint. This paper extends the previous results by considering a more realistic duty cycle constraint where the extra cost of transitions between transmissions and nontransmissions due to pulse shaping is accounted for. The capacity-achieving input is no longer independent over time and is hard to compute. A lower bound of the input-output mutual information as a function of the input distribution is developed, which is shown to be maximized by a first-order Markov process, the distribution of which can be computed efficiently. Simulation results show that the Markov input is superior to i.i.d. inputs for the Gaussian channel subject to the realistic duty cycle and average power constraints.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Efficient Algorithm to Calculate BICM Capacity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) is a practical approach for reliable communication over the AWGN channel in the bandwidth limited regime. For a signal point constellation with 2^m points, BICM labels the signal points with bit strings of length m and then treats these m bits separately both at transmitter and receiver. To determine the capacity of BICM, the mutual information between input and output has to be maximized over the bit pmfs. This is a non-convex optimization problem. So far, the optimal pmfs were determined via exhaustive search, which is of exponential complexity in m. In this work, an algorithm called bit-alternating convex concave method (BACM) is developed. This algorithm calculates BICM capacity with a complexity that scales approximately as m^3. The algorithm iteratively applies convex optimization techniques. BACM is used to calculate BICM capacity of 4,8,16,32, and 64-PAM in AWGN. For constellations with more than 8 points, the presented values are the first results known in literature.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Quantization Effect On Second Moment of Log-Likelihood Ratio and Its Application to Decentralized Sequential Detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>It is well known that quantization cannot increase the Kullback-Leibler divergence which can be thought of as the expected value or first moment of the log-likelihood ratio. In this paper, we investigate the quantization effects on the second moment of the log-likelihood ratio. It is shown that quantization may result in an increase in the case of the second moment, but the increase is bounded above by $2/e.$ The result is then applied to decentralized sequential detection problems to provide a simpler sufficient condition for asymptotic optimality theory, and the technique is also extended to investigate the quantization effects on other higher-order moments of the log-likelihood ratio and provide lower bounds on higher-order moments.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The sufficiency principle for decentralized data reduction</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD This paper develops the sufficiency principle suitable for data reduction in decentralized inference systems. Both parallel and tandem networks are studied and we focus on the cases where observations at decentralized nodes are conditionally dependent. For a parallel network, through the introduction of a hidden variable that induces conditional independence among the observations, the locally sufficient statistics, defined with respect to the hidden variable, are shown to be globally sufficient for parameter of interest. For a tandem network, the notion of conditional sufficiency is introduced and the related theories and tools are developed. We illustrate its usefulness in the classical problem of remote rate distortion with side information when compression using conditional sufficient statistic is shown to preserve the original rate distortion function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Nonparametric Decentralized Detection Based on Weighted Count Kernel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The nonparametric decentralized detection problem is investigated, in which the joint distribution of the environmental event and the sensors' observations are not known and only a set of training samples are available. The system features rate constraints, i.e., integer bit constraints on sensors' transmissions, different qualities of observations, additional observations to the fusion center, and multi-level tree-structured network. Our study adopts the kernel-based nonparametric approach proposed by Nguyen, Wainwright, and Jordan with the following generalization. A weighted count kernel is introduced so that the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) (over which the fusion center's decision rule is optimized) allows the fusion center's decision rule to count information from sensors and its own observations differently. In order to find the optimal decision rules, our optimization is solved by alternatively and recursively conducting three optimization steps: finding the optimal weight parameters in the weighted count kernel for selecting the best associated RKHS, finding the best optimal decision rule for the fusion center over the identified RKHS, and finding the local decision rules for sensors. Generalization to multilevel tree-structured network is also discussed. Finally numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance based on the proposed weighted count kernel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Distributed Estimation in Multi-Agent Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A problem of distributed state estimation at multiple agents that are physically connected and have competitive interests is mapped to a distributed source coding problem with additional privacy constraints. The agents interact to estimate their own state to a desired fidelity from their (sensor) measurements which are a function of both the local state and the states at the other agents. For a Gaussian state and measurement model, it is shown that the sum-rate achieved by a distributed protocol in which the agents broadcast to one another is a lower bound on that of a centralized protocol in which the agents broadcast as if to a virtual CEO converging only in the limit of a large number of agents. The sufficiency of encoding using local measurements is also proved for both protocols.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Quantum polar codes for arbitrary channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We construct a new entanglement-assisted quantum polar coding scheme which achieves the symmetric coherent information rate by synthesizing &quot;amplitude&quot; and &quot;phase&quot; channels from a given, arbitrary quantum channel. We first demonstrate the coding scheme for arbitrary quantum channels with qubit inputs, and we show that quantum data can be reliably decoded by O(N) rounds of coherent quantum successive cancellation, followed by N controlled-NOT gates (where N is the number of channel uses). We also find that the entanglement consumption rate of the code vanishes for degradable quantum channels. Finally, we extend the coding scheme to channels with multiple qubit inputs. This gives a near-explicit method for realizing one of the most striking phenomena in quantum information theory: the superactivation effect, whereby two quantum channels which individually have zero quantum capacity can have a non-zero quantum capacity when used together.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Construction of Quantum Codes via A Class of Classical Polynomial Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>There have been various constructions of classical codes from polynomial valuations in literature \cite{ARC04, LNX01,LX04,XF04,XL00}. In this paper, we present a construction of classical codes based on polynomial construction again. One of the features of this construction is that not only the classical codes arisen from the construction have good parameters, but also quantum codes with reasonably good parameters can be produced from these classical codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Quantum LDPC codes obtained by non-binary constructions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We generalize a construction of non-binary quantum LDPC codes over $\F_{2^m}$ due to \cite{KHIS11a} and apply it in particular to toric codes. We obtain in this way not only codes with better rates than toric codes but also improve dramatically the performance of standard iterative decoding. Moreover, the new codes obtained in this fashion inherit the distance properties of the underlying toric codes and have therefore a minimum distance which grows as the square root of the length of the code for fixed $m$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Improved quantum hypergraph-product LDPC codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We suggest several techniques to improve the toric codes and the finite-rate generalized toric codes (quantum hypergraph-product codes) recently introduced by Tillich and Zemor. For the usual toric codes, we introduce the rotated lattices specified by two integer-valued periodicity vectors. These codes include the checkerboard codes, and the family of minimal single-qubit-encoding toric codes with block length $n=t^2+(t+1)^2$ and distance $d=2t+1$, $t=1,2,\ldots$. We also suggest several related algebraic constructions which nearly quadruple the rate of the existing hypergraph-product codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Real-Time and Causal Secure Source Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We investigate two source coding problems with secrecy constraints. In the first problem we consider real--time fully secure transmission of a memoryless source. We show that although classical variable--rate coding is not an option since the lengths of the codewords leak information on the source, the key rate can be as low as the average Huffman codeword length of the source. In the second problem we consider causal source coding with a fidelity criterion and side information at the decoder and the eavesdropper. We show that when the eavesdropper has degraded side information, it is optimal to first use a causal rate distortion code and then encrypt its output with a key.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rate-Distortion Behavior at Low Distortion for Densely Sampled Gaussian Data</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>It is well known that for discrete-time, stationary sources, most lossy source coding techniques have operational rate-distortion functions that approach the Shannon rate-distortion function with respect to squared error to within an additive constant as distortion approaches zero. With the goal of investigating similar phenomena for continuous-time sources, this paper investigates the low-distortion performance of distributed coding of continuous-time sources based on high-rate sampling. It is found that for bandlimited sources and nonbandlimited sources whose spectra have sufficiently light tails, distributed source coding is asymptotically as good as centralized coding in the small distortion regime. On the other hand, for spectra with heavier tails it is found, at least in one important case, that for small distortions, the distributed rate-distortion function is approximately 20% larger than the Shannon rate-distortion. The conclusion is that the closeness of the distributed and centralized rate-distortion functions depends strongly on the tail of the source spectrum.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Pointwise lossy source coding theorem for sources with memory</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD We investigate the minimum pointwise redundancy of variable length lossy source codes operating at fixed distortion for sources with memory. The redundancy is defined by $l_n(X_1^n)- nR(D)$, where $l_n(X_1^n)$ is the code length at block size $n$ and $R(D)$ is the rate distortion function. We restrict ourselves to the case where $R(D)$ can be calculated, namely the cases where the Shannon lower bound to $R(D)$ holds with equality. In this case, for balanced distortion measures, we provide a pointwise lower bound to the code length sequence in terms of the entropy density process. We show that the minimum coding variance with distortion is lower bounded by the minimum lossless coding variance, and is non-zero unless the entropy density is deterministic. We also examine lossy coding in the presence of long range dependence, and show the existence of information sources for which long range dependence persists under any codec operating at the Shannon lower bound with fixed distortion.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Gaussian Rate-Distortion via Sparse Linear Regression over Compact Dictionaries</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study a class of codes for compressing memoryless Gaussian sources, designed using the statistical framework of high-dimensional linear regression. Codewords are linear combinations of subsets of columns of a design matrix. With minimum-distance encoding we show that such a codebook can attain the rate-distortion function with the optimal error-exponent, for all distortions below a specified value. The structure of the codebook is motivated by an analogous construction proposed recently by Barron and Joseph for communication over an AWGN channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lossy Source Coding via Spatially Coupled LDGM Ensembles</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study a new encoding scheme for lossy source compression based on spatially coupled low-density generator-matrix codes. We develop a belief-propagation guided-decimation algorithm, and show that this algorithm allows to approach the optimal distortion of spatially coupled ensembles. Moreover, using the survey propagation formalism, we also observe that the optimal distortions of the spatially coupled and individual code ensembles are the same. Since regular low-density generator-matrix codes are known to achieve the Shannon rate-distortion bound under optimal encoding as the degrees grow, our results suggest that spatial coupling can be used to reach the rate-distortion bound, under a low complexity belief-propagation guided-decimation algorithm.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we show that superposition coding is not optimal for three-receiver more capable channels. The optimality of superposition coding region has been open for k-receiver (k &gt;= 3) more capable broadcast channel. The main contribution is in identifying a counterexample to demonstrate that superposition coding is sub-optimal. We also compute the capacity region for the counter example. On the other hand, we show that the sum-capacity for a $k$-receiver more capable broadcast channel is obtained by transmitting all the information to the most capable receiver.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Capacity Region of Some Classes of Parallel Degraded Broadcast Channels with Three Receivers and Three-Degraded Message Sets</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a broadcast channel with three receivers and three-degraded message sets, where the transmitter has a common message intended for all three receivers, a message intended for receivers 2 and 3, and a private message intended for receiver 3. The messages are transmitted over a family of parallel degraded broadcast channels. In the most general case, there are six parallel degraded broadcast channels with different orders of degradedness. We determine the capacity region for two classes of broadcast channels with five parallel degraded broadcast channels. The main difficulty is in identifying the relevant auxiliary random variables in the proofs of the converse. To accomplish this, we make use of an information theoretic inequality that can be proven using the Csiszar-sum identity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Broadcast Capacity Regions with Three Receivers and Message Cognition</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the capacity region of a three receiver broadcast channel with some message cognition at two receivers. The problem generalizes the bi-directional broadcast channel to include a third receiver, a common message and (partial) message cognition. We characterize the capacity region for several classes of less noisy, more capable, and deterministic broadcast channels.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Three-Receiver Broadcast Channels with Side Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Three-receiver broadcast channel (BC) is of interest due to its information theoretical differences with two receiver one. In this paper, we derive achievable rate regions for two classes of 3-receiver BC with side information available at the transmitter, Multilevel BC and 3-receiver less noisy BC, by using superposition coding, Gel'fand-Pinsker binning scheme and Nair-El Gamal indirect decoding. Our rate region for multilevel BC subsumes the Steinberg rate region for 2-receiver degraded BC with side information as its special case. We also find the capacity region of 3-receiver less noisy BC when side information is available both at the transmitter and at the receivers.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Is Non-Unique Decoding Necessary?</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In multiterminal communication systems, signals carrying messages meant for different destinations are often observed together at any given destination receiver. Han and Kobayashi (1981) proposed a receiving strategy which performs a joint decoding of messages of interest along with a subset of messages which are not of interest. It is now well-known that this provides an achievable region which is, in general, larger than if the receiver treats as noise all messages not of interest. Nair and El Gamal (2009) and Chong, Motani, Garg, and El Gamal (2008) independently proposed a generalization called indirect or non-unique decoding where the receiver outputs even if it is unable to disambiguate uniquely some of the messages which are not of interest to it. Non-unique decoding has since been used in various scenarios.&#13;
&#13;
The main result in this paper is to provide an operational interpretation why non-unique decoding, in all known cases where it has been employed, can be replaced by a particularly designed joint decoding strategy, without any penalty from a rate region viewpoint.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Blind Compute-and-Forward</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Compute-and-forward (C\&amp;F) relaying usually requires channel state information (CSI) at the receivers so that an ``optimal'' scale factor can be computed for the purposes of decoding. In this paper, a blind C\&amp;F scheme---i.e., one not requiring CSI---is developed. Rather than attempting to compute the optimal scale factor, this new scheme seeks one (or more) ``good'' scalars, i.e., scalars which allow correct decoding despite possibly being sub-optimal. The region of all such good scalars is characterized. To find a good scalar, a computationally efficient scheme, involving error-detection and a hierarchically organized list, is proposed. Simulation results show that this blind C\&amp;F scheme achieves---for a class of lattices admitting an efficient trellis decoder---the same throughput as its CSI-enabled counterpart, at the expense of, approximately, a ten-fold increase in computational complexity in the high-throughput region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rateless Coded Hybrid Amplify/Decode-Forward Cooperation for Wireless Multicast</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a cooperative wireless multicast channel with no channel state information available at the transmitters, and where all wireless links undergo independent identically distributed quasi-static Rayleigh fading. For cooperation, we propose a rateless coded approach and identify its benefits over a conventional fixed-rate two-hop strategy. In addition to providing robust communications under fading conditions, rateless coding is able to exploit the cooperation benefits to a greater degree. A hybrid rateless coded cooperation scheme is proposed which employs amplify-and-forward (AF) in conjunction with decode-and-forward (DF) strategy. Results based on Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that the rateless coded hybrid scheme is able to significantly outperform two-hop cooperation, as well as the individual AF and DF strategies.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Dynamic QMF for Half-Duplex Relay Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The value of relay nodes to enhance the error performance versus rate trade-off in wireless networks has been studied extensively. However, wireless nodes currently are constrained to only transmit or receive at a given frequency, i.e., half-duplex constraint. The diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) for half-duplex networks are less understood. In fact the two special networks for which the DMT is known advocate completely different relaying strategies. The line network suggests the use of dynamic decoding, whereas the relay channel shows that a Quantize-Map-Forward strategy [1], with fixed half-duplex schedule, is optimal. In this paper we establish the DMT of a multi-antenna relay channel that needs both these strategies. Furthermore, we propose generalization of these strategies through a dynamic QMF that outperforms both schemes for another network example.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Joint Optimization of The Transmit Covariance and The Relay Precoder in General Gaussian Amplify-and-Forward Relay Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The capacity of the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme in general full-duplex Gaussian relay channels is achieved by Gaussian codebooks and can be cast as the solution of an optimization problem of the input transmit covariance and the relay precoder. This problem is non-convex. To circumvent this difficulty, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used to obtain closed form expressions of the optimal input covariance that corresponds to an arbitrary relay precoder. Using these expressions, it is shown the maximum rate of the AF scheme is achieved by subdiagonal precoders. This observation is used to facilitate the search for the optimal relay precoder, and to show that operating in a half-duplex mode satisfies necessary optimality conditions at both low and high transmit powers.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Layered Quantize-Forward For The Two-Way Relay Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper proposes two new coding schemes for the discrete memoryless two-way relay channel. The main target is to show the benefits of compress-forward without Wyner-Ziv binning and of layered relaying in networks wherein a relay is to help multiple destinations, that may have unequal channel quality and/or have access to different side information. Numerical results for a Gaussian channel show that the new coding schemes outperform variants of compress-forward relaying and offer a good trade-off between achievable rates and complexity and decoding delay. The idea can also be applied to other relay networks.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Broadcasting Private Messages Securely</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider a source, Alice, broadcasting private messages to multiple receivers through a broadcast erasure channel; users send back to Alice public feedback that she causally uses to decide the coding strategy for her following transmissions. Recently, the multiple unicast capacity region for this problem has been exactly characterized for a number of special cases; namely the 2-user, 3-user, symmetric K-user, and one-sidedly fair K-user [1][2]. &#13;
&#13;
In this paper, we show that for all the cases where such characterizations exist, we can also optimally characterize the &quot;secure&quot; communication rates, where the message that Alice transmits to each user is information theoretically secure from the other users, even if these collude. We show that a simple, two-phase strategy, where appropriate amounts of secret keys are first generated and then consumed, matches a new outer bound we derive.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Private Broadcasting over Independent Parallel Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study private broadcasting of two messages to two groups of users over two reversely degraded parallel channels. Group 1 has two users, both interested in a common message whereas group 2 has only one user. The message for each group of users needs to be kept confidential from users in the other group. For a special degradation structure we establish the entire capacity region. Our coding scheme combines secure-product codebook and the secure-multicast codebook constructions from earlier works using a superposition code.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Degraded Broadcast Channel with Noncausal Side Information, Confidential Messages and Noiseless Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we investigate the model of degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information, confidential messages and noiseless feedback. This work is from Steinberg's work on the degraded broadcast channel with noncausal side information, and Csisz$\acute{a}$r and K\&quot;{o}rner's work on broadcast channel with confidential messages. &#13;
&#13;
In this new model, the transmitter sends a confidential message to the non-degraded receiver, and meanwhile sends a common message to both the degraded and non-degraded receivers (the confidential message does not need to be independent with the common message). Moreover, the channel for the non-degraded receiver is controlled by channel state information (side information), and it is available to the transmitter in a noncausal manner (termed here noncausal side information). In addition, we assume that there is a noiseless feedback from the output of the channel for the non-degraded receiver to the transmitter, and it helps them share a secret key, which enlarges the degraded receiver's uncertainty about the confidential message.&#13;
&#13;
Measuring the uncertainty by equivocation (conditional entropy), the capacity region composed of all achievable rates-equivocation triples is determined for this new model. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity is formulated, which provides the best transmission rate with perfect secrecy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Optimal Signaling over Secure MIMO Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Optimal signaling over the wire-tap MIMO Gaussian channel is studied under the total transmit power constraint. A direct proof of the necessary condition of optimality (signaling on the positive directions of the difference channel) is given using the necessary KKT conditions. Based on it, an explicit, closed-form solution for the optimal transmit covariance matrix is given when the latter is of the full rank. The cases of weak eavesdropper and high SNR are considered. It is shown that the optimal covariance does not converge to a scaled identity in the latter regime. A refined estimate of the rank of an optimal covariance matrix is given for the general case.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Square Root Law for Communication with Low Probability of Detection on AWGN Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We present a square root limit on low probability of detection (LPD) communication over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. Specifically, if a warden has an AWGN channel to the transmitter with non-zero noise power, we prove that $o(\sqrt{n})$ bits can be sent from the transmitter to the receiver in $n$ AWGN channel uses with probability of detection by the warden less than $\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, and, if a lower bound on the noise power on the warden's channel is known, then $O(\sqrt{n})$ bits can be covertly sent in $n$ channel uses. Conversely, trying to transmit more than $O(\sqrt{n})$ bits either results in detection by the warden with probability one or a non-zero probability of decoding error as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Further, we show that LPD communication on the AWGN channel allows one to send a non-zero symbol on every channel use, in contrast to what might be expected from the square root law found recently in image-based steganography.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Spatially Coupled Ensembles Universally Achieve Capacity under Belief Propagation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We investigate spatially coupled code ensembles. For transmission over the binary erasure channel, it was recently shown that spatial coupling increases the belief propagation threshold of the ensemble to essentially the maximum a-priori threshold of the underlying component ensemble. This explains why convolutional LDPC ensembles, originally introduced by Felstrom and Zigangirov, perform so well over this channel.&#13;
&#13;
We show that the equivalent result holds true for transmission over general binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. More precisely, given a desired error probability and a gap to capacity, we can construct a spatially coupled ensemble which fulfills these constraints universally on this class of channels under belief propagation decoding. In fact, most codes in that ensemble have that property. The quantifier universal refers to the single ensemble/code which is good for all channels if we assume that the channel is known at the receiver.&#13;
&#13;
The key technical result is a proof that under belief propagation decoding spatially coupled ensembles achieve essentially the area threshold of the underlying uncoupled ensemble.&#13;
&#13;
We conclude by discussing some interesting open problems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>How to Prove the Maxwell Conjecture Via Spatial Coupling - A Proof of Concept</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Investigations on spatially coupled codes have lead to the conjecture that, in the infinite size limit, the average input-output conditional entropy for spatially coupled low-density parity-check ensembles, over binary memoryless symmetric channels, equals the entropy of the underlying individual ensemble. We give a self-contained proof of this conjecture for the case where the degree of variable nodes is Poisson-distributed and that of parity checks is constant. The ingredients of the proof are the interpolation method and the Nishimori identities. We explain why this result is an important step towards proving the Maxwell conjecture in the theory of low-density parity-check codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Spatially-Coupled Binary MacKay-Neal Codes for Channels with Non-Binary Inputs and Affine Subspace Outputs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study LDPC codes for the channel with $2^m$-ary input $\underline{x}\in \mathbb{F}_2^m$ and output $\underline{y}=\underline{x}+\underline{z}\in \mathbb{F}_2^m$. The receiver knows a subspace $V\subset \mathbb{F}_2^m$ from which $\underline{z}=\underline{y}-\underline{x}$ is uniformly chosen. Or equivalently, the receiver receives an affine subspace $\underline{y}-V$ where $\underline{x}$ lies. We consider a joint iterative decoder involving the channel detector and the LDPC decoder. The decoding system considered in this paper can be viewed as a simplified model of the joint iterative decoder over non-binary modulated signal inputs e.g., $2^m$-QAM. We evaluate the performance of binary spatially-coupled MacKay-Neal codes by density evolution. The iterative decoding threshold is seriously degraded by increasing $m$. EXIT-like function curve calculations reveal that this degradation is caused by wiggles and can be mitigated by increasing the randomized window size. The resultant iterative decoding threshold values are very close to the Shannon limit.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Improving Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes by Connecting Chains</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we study ensembles of connected spatially coupled low-density parity-check codes (SC-LDPCCs), i.e., ensembles described by graphs in which regular SC-LDPCC chains of various lengths serve as edges. We show that, by carefully connecting individual SC-LDPCC chains, we obtain LDPC code ensembles with improved iterative decoding thresholds compared to those of a single coupled chain, in addition to reducing the decoding complexity required to achieve a specific bit error probability. Moreover, we show that, like the component SC-LDPCC chains, the proposed constructions have a typical minimum distance that grows linearly with block length.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Distance Spectrum Estimation of LDPC Convolutional Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Time-invariant low-density parity-check convolutional codes (LDPC-CCs) derived from corresponding quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC block codes (LDPC-BCs) can be described by a polynomial syndrome former matrix (polynomial-domain transposed parity-check matrix). In this paper, an estimation of the distance spectrum of time-invariant LDPC-CCs is obtained by splitting the polynomial syndrome former matrix into submatrices representing super codes and then evaluating the linear dependence between codewords of the corresponding super codes. This estimation results in an upper bound on the minimum free distance of the original code and, additionally, a lower bound on the number of codewords Aw with Hamming weight w.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Spatially-Coupled Random Access on Graphs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we investigate the effect of spatial coupling applied to the recently-proposed coded slotted Aloha (CSA) random access protocol. Thanks to the bridge between the graphical model describing the iterative interference cancelation process of CSA over the random access frame and the erasure recovery process of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), we propose an access protocol which is inspired by the convolutional LDPC code construction. The proposed protocol exploits the terminations of its graphical model to achieve the spatial coupling effect, attaining performance close to the theoretical limits of CSA. As for the convolutional LDPC code case, large iterative decoding thresholds are obtained by simply increasing the density of the graph. We show that the threshold saturation effect takes place by defining a suitable counterpart of the maximum-a-posteriori decoding threshold of spatially-coupled LDPC code ensembles. In the asymptotic setting, the proposed scheme allows sustaining a traffic close to 1 [packets/slot].</abstract>

        <papertitle>Biff (Bloom Filter) Codes: Fast Error Correction for Large Data Sets</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Large data sets are increasingly common in cloud and virtualized environments. For example, transfers of multiple gigabytes are commonplace, as are replicated blocks of such sizes. There is a need for fast error-correction or data reconciliation in such settings even when the expected number of errors is small.&#13;
&#13;
Motivated by such cloud reconciliation problems, we consider error-correction schemes designed for large data, after explaining why previous approaches appear unsuitable. We introduce Biff codes, which are based on Bloom filters and are designed for large data. For Biff codes with a message of length $L$ and $E$ errors, the encoding time is $O(L)$, decoding time is $O(L + E)$ and the space overhead is $O(E)$. Biff codes are low-density parity-check codes; they are similar to Tornado codes, but are designed for errors instead of erasures. Further, Biff codes are designed to be very simple, removing any explicit graph structures and based entirely on hash tables. We derive Biff codes by a simple reduction from a set reconciliation algorithm for a recently developed data structure, invertible Bloom lookup tables. While the underlying theory is extremely simple, what makes this code especially attractive is the ease with which it can be implemented and the speed of decoding, which we demonstrate with a prototype implementation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Distributed Rateless Coding with Cooperative Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. In this paper, we propose a distributed rateless coding (DRC) scheme for a two-user cooperative system. In the DRC scheme the overall transmission is divided into two phases, a broadcast phase and a cooperative phase. In the broadcast phase, each user keep transmitting its rateless coded symbols to the other user and the destination until its message has been successfully decoded by the other user and an acknowledgement is received. In the cooperation phase, each user decodes the other user's message and encodes both users' message use a rateless code and transmit the codewords to the destination. A linear programming optimization problem is then formulated to find the optimal degree distribution for the proposed distributed rateless codes. The performance of the proposed codes is analyzed and analysis is validated by simulations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Matching Short LDPC Codes with Spectrally-Efficient Modulation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The combination of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and higher-order modulation does usually neither require an interleaver in between nor elaborated signal mapping design rules. However, as the constellation size increases, a matching interleaver can be employed to compensate performance losses, especially in case of structured codes. This interleaver can be generally described by mapping distributions. In this paper, we discuss optimized mapping distributions for short LDPC codes, i.e. in the order of 100-1000 bits. We point out that mapping distributions optimized by means of density evolution may not be suited for short codes. An alternative framework is introduced that utilizes an extended version of extrinsic information transfer functions. Their visualization feature helps to identify good mapping distributions for short codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Power Transfer of Error-Control Codes for RFID Communications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work, we consider the power spectrum of error-control codes designed for the reader-to-tag channel in near-field passive radio frequency identification (RFID) systems using inductive coupling as a power transfer mechanism. In contrast to previous works, binary phase-shift keying is considered, and the power spectral density is computed for two of the codes (and one runlength constraint) considered in a recent paper by Barbero et al. (Inf. Theory Appl., San Diego, CA, 2011), and for two new codes introduced in this paper. Furthermore, we compute the total power transferred to the tag as a function of the inter-coil separation for different codes (and one runlength constraint).</abstract>

        <papertitle>A characterization of the number of subsequences obtained via the deletion channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Motivated by the study of {\em deletion channels}, this work presents improved bounds on the number of subsequences obtained from a binary sting $X$ of length $n$ under $t$ deletions. It is known that the number of subsequences in this setting strongly depends on the number of {\em runs} in the string $X$; where a run is a maximal sequence of the same character. Our improved bounds are obtained by a structural analysis of the family of $r$-run strings $X$, an analysis in which we identify the {\em extremal} strings with respect to the number of subsequences. Specifically, for every $r$, we present $r$-run strings with the minimum (respectively maximum) number of subsequences under any $t$ deletions; and perform an exact analysis of the number of subsequences of these extremal strings.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Adaptive Synchronization Marker for Insertion/Deletion/Substitution Error Correction</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper proposes an adaptive selection method of synchronization marker to improve the error correction capability of insertion/deletion/substitution error correcting code. The adaptive markers are inserted into every d bits of a codeword of LDPC code, where the marker value is determined depending on the neighboring bits of the codeword. This paper also shows a forward-backward algorithm to calculate the symbol-by-symbol likelihood. Evaluation shows that the bit error rate of the proposed method is lower than that of the conventional method using fixed synchronization marker.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Coloring Approach to Constructing Deletion Correcting Codes from Constant Weight Subgraphs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We take a graph theoretic view of deletion correcting codes. The problem of finding an $n$-bit $s$-deletion correcting code is equivalent to finding an independent set in a particular graph. We discuss the relationship between codes and colorings and demonstrate that the VT codes are optimal in a coloring sense. We describe a method of partitioning the set of bit strings by Hamming weight and finding codes within each partition. In the single deletion case, we find an optimal coloring of the constant Hamming weight induced subgraphs. We show that the resulting code is asymptotically optimal. We also prove a lower bound on size of codes constructed using these partitions for any number of deletions.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper describes a framework in which directed information is defined on abstract spaces. The framework is employed to derive properties of directed information such as convexity, concavity, lower semicontinuity, by using the topology of weak convergence of probability measures on Polish spaces. Two extremum problems of directed information related to capacity of channels with memory and feedback, and causal and sequential rate distortion are extensively analyzed showing existence of maximizing and minimizing solutions, respectively.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Universal Estimation of Directed Information via Sequential Probability Assignments</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We propose four approaches to estimating the directed information rate between a pair of jointly stationary ergodic processes with the help of universal probability assignments. The four approaches yield estimators with different merits such as nonnegativity and boundedness. We establish consistency of these estimators in various senses and derive near-optimal rates of convergence in the minimax sense under mild conditions. The estimators carry over directly to estimating other information measures of stationary ergodic processes, such as entropy rate and mutual information rate, and provide alternatives to classical approaches in the existing literature. Guided by the theoretical results, we use context tree weighting as the vehicle for the implementations of the proposed estimators. Experiments on synthetic and real data are presented, demonstrating the potential of the proposed schemes in practice and the efficacy of directed information estimation as a tool for detecting and measuring causality and delay.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lossy Common Information of Two Dependent Random Variables</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The two most prevalent notions of common information are due to Wyner and Gács-Körner and both the notions can be stated as two different characteristic points in the lossless Gray-Wyner region. Although these quantities can be easily evaluated for random variables with infinite entropy (eg. continuous random variables), the operational significance underlying their definition is applicable only to the lossless framework. The primary objective of this paper is to generalize these two notions of common information to the lossy Gray-Wyner network, which extends the theoretical intuition underlying their definitions for general sources and distortion measures. We begin with the lossy generalization of Wyner's common information, defined as the minimum rate on the shared branch of the Gray-Wyner network at minimum sum rate when the two decoders reconstruct the sources subject to individual distortion constraints. We derive a complete single letter information theoretic characterization for this quantity and use it to compute the common information of symmetric bivariate Gaussian random variables. We then derive similar results to generalize Gács-Körner's definition to the lossy framework. These two characterizations allow us to carry the practical insight underlying the two notions of common information to general sources and distortion measures.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Information Divergence is more chi square distributed than the chi squared statistics</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>For testing goodness of fit it is very popular to use either the chi square statistic or G square statistics (information divergence). Asymptotically both are chi square distributed so an obvious question is which of the two statistics that has a distribution that is closest to the chi square distribution. Surprisingly, when there is only one degree of freedom it seems like the distribution of information divergence is much better approximated by a chi squared distribution than the chi square statistic. For random variables we introduce a new transformation that transform several important distributions into new random variables that are almost Gaussian. For the binomial distributions and the Poisson distributions we formulate a general conjecture about how close their transform are to the Gaussian. The conjecture is proved for Poisson distributions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Ultimate Limits of Optical Communication Efficiency with Photon-Counting Receivers</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Coherent states achieve the Holevo capacity of a pure-loss channel when paired with an optimal measurement, but a physical realization of this measurement is unknown, and likely to be of high complexity. In this paper, we focus on the photon-counting measurement and study the photon and dimensional efficiencies attainable with modulations over classical- and nonclassical-state alphabets. We first review state-of-the-art coherent on-off-keying (OOK) and pulse-position modulation (PPM) with a photon-counting measurement, illustrating its asymptotic inefficiency relative to the Holevo limit. Then we analyze two architectures that improve upon the dimensional versus photon efficiency tradeoff achievable with conventional OOK or PPM. We show that at high photon efficiency these architectures achieve an efficiency tradeoff that differs from the best possible tradeoff by only a constant factor. The first architecture is a coherent-state transmitter that relies on feedback from the receiver to control the transmitted energy. The second architecture uses a single-photon number-state source.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Polar coding to achieve the Holevo capacity of a pure-loss optical channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In the low-energy high-energy-efficiency regime of classical optical communications---relevant to deep-space channels for instance---there is a big gap between the reliable communication rates achievable via conventional optical receivers and the ultimate (Holevo) capacity. Achieving the Holevo capacity would require not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collective measurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and it is not possible to implement these collective measurements via symbol-by-symbol detection along with postprocessing in the electronics/software domain. In this paper, we apply our recent results on the classical-quantum polar code---the first near-explicit, linear, symmetric-Holevo-rate achieving code---to the lossy optical channel, and we show that it almost closes the entire gap to the Holevo capacity in the low photon number regime. An optical realization of the successive-cancellation joint-detection receiver remains an open question.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Explicit capacity-achieving receivers for optical communication and quantum reading</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An important practical open question has been to design explicit, structured optical receivers that achieve the Holevo limit in the contexts of optical communication and &quot;quantum reading.&quot; The Holevo limit is an achievable rate that is higher than the Shannon limit of any known optical receiver. We demonstrate how a sequential decoding approach can achieve the Holevo limit for both of these settings. A crucial part of our scheme for both settings is a non-destructive &quot;vacuum-or-not&quot; measurement that projects an n-symbol modulated codeword onto the n-fold vacuum state or its orthogonal complement, such that the post-measurement state is either the n-fold vacuum or has the vacuum removed from the support of the n symbols' joint quantum state. The sequential decoder for optical communication requires the additional ability to perform multimode optical phase-space displacements---realizable using a beamsplitter and a laser, while the sequential decoder for quantum reading also requires the ability to perform phase-shifting (realizable using a phase plate) and online squeezing (a phase-sensitive amplifier).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Quantum M-ary Phase Shift Keying</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We develop a theory of quantum M-ary phase shift keying in which quantum states of optical modes are modulated at the transmitter by applying one of M uniformly-spaced phase shifts. We allow full freedom in choosing modulation states with any number of signal, i.e., transmitted, and ancilla modes, subject only to an average energy, i.e., photon number, constraint in either the signal modes alone or in the signal and ancilla modes together. For lossless operation and unrestricted POVM measurements at the receiver, we find the explicit form of the modulation state that minimizes the average error probability under an energy constraint of N photons. Multiple signal modes, mixed states, and entanglement with an ancilla are shown to be unnecessary for optimum performance. We show that communication with zero error is possible if and only if N is greater than or equal to (M-1)/2.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Lossless Universal Compression of Distributed Identical Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of data gathering from distributed sources arises in many applications such as sensor networks and Internet multi-homing. Oftentimes, the correlation in such data can be leveraged to reduce the amount of data transmission. Slepian-Wolf theorem is a well-known framework that targets almost lossless compression of (two) data streams with symbol-by-symbol correlation between the outputs of (two) distributed sources. However, this paper considers a different scenario which does not fit in the Slepian-Wolf framework. We consider two identical but spatially separated sources. We wish to study the universal compression of a sequence of length $n$ from one of the sources provided that the decoder has access to (i.e., memorized) a sequence of length $m$ from the other source. Such a scenario occurs, for example, in the universal compression of data from multiple mirrors of the same server. In this setup, the correlation does not arise from symbol-by-symbol dependency of two outputs from the two sources. Instead, the sequences are correlated through the information that they contain about the unknown source parameter. We show that the finite-length nature of the compression problem at hand requires considering a notion of almost lossless source coding, where coding incurs an error probability $p_e$ that vanishes with sequence length $n$. We obtain a lower bound on the average minimax redundancy of almost lossless codes as a function of the sequence length $n$ and the permissible error probability $p_e$ when the decoder has a memory of length $m$ and the encoders do not communicate. Our results demonstrate that a strict performance loss is incurred when the two encoders do not communicate even when the decoder knows the unknown parameter vector.</abstract>

        <abstract>We derive an outer bound of the rate region of the vector Gaussian $L$-terminal CEO problem by establishing a lower bound on each supporting hyperplane of the rate region. To this end we prove a new extremal inequality by exploiting the connection between differential entropy and Fisher information as well as some fundamental estimation-theoretic inequalities. It is shown that the outer bound matches the Berger-Tung inner bound in the high-resolution regime.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Outer Bound for the Vector Gaussian CEO Problem</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot;. We study the vector Gaussian CEO problem, and provide an outer bound for its rate-distortion region. We obtain our outer bound by evaluating an outer bound for the multi-terminal source coding problem by means of a technique relying on the de Bruijn identity and the properties of the Fisher information. Next, we show that our outer bound strictly improves upon the existing outer bounds for all system parameters. We show this strict improvement by providing a specific example, for which, there is a gap between our outer bound and the existing outer bounds. However, despite this improvement, our outer bound does not provide the exact rate-distortion region in general. We show this sub-optimality by providing an example, for which, the rate-distortion region is strictly contained in our outer bound.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Marton's inner bound for broadcast channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Marton's inner bound is the best known achievable region for a general discrete memoryless broadcast channel. To compute Marton's inner bound one has to solve an optimization problem over a set of joint distributions on the input and auxiliary random variables. The optimizers turn out to be structured in many cases. Finding properties of optimizers not only results in efficient evaluation of the region, but it may also help one to prove factorization of Marton's inner bound (and thus its optimality). The first part of this paper formulates this factorization approach explicitly and states some conjectures and results along this line. The second part of this paper focuses primarily on the structure of the optimizers. This section is inspired by a new binary inequality that recently resulted in a very simple characterization of the sum-rate of Marton's inner bound for binary input broadcast channels. This prompted us to investigate whether this inequality can be extended to larger cardinality input alphabets. We show that several of the results for the binary input case do carry over for higher cardinality alphabets and we present a collection of results that help restrict the search space of probability distributions to evaluate the boundary of Marton's inner bound in the general case. We also prove a new inequality for the binary skew-symmetric broadcast channel that yields a very simple characterization of the entire Marton inner bound for this channel.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We derive the capacity region of the state-dependent semideterministic broadcast channel with noncausal state-information at the transmitter. In this broadcast channel one of the outputs is a deterministic function of the channel input and the channel state, and the state is assumed to be known noncausally to the transmitter but not to the receivers.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Degraded Broadcast Channel with Action-Dependent States</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we derive the capacity region of the degraded broadcast channel with action dependent states and causal side information at the encoder. Two main models are studied: the case where the actions depend only on the messages, and the case where the actions can depend also on past values of the state. The latter model is referred to as actions with feedback. When the actions depend only on the mesages, the full capacity region is derived. We then show that if the channel is physically degraded, then dependence of the actions on past values of the state does not increase its capacity region. We further demonstrate by an example that if the channel is stochastically degraded, action feedback can increase its capacity region. This situation resembles previous results on feedback in regular (state-independent) broadcast channels.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Percolation in Directed Random Geometric Graphs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The connectivity graph of wireless networks, under many models as well as in practice, may contain unidirectional links. The simplifying assumption that such links are useless is often made, mainly because most wireless protocols use per-hop acknowledgments. However, two-way communication between a pair of nodes can be established as soon as there exists paths in both directions between them. Therefore, instead of discarding unidirectional links, one might be interested in studying the strongly connected components of the connectivity graph. In this paper, we look at the percolation phenomenon in some directed random geometric graphs that can be used to model wireless networks. We show that among the nodes that can be reached from the origin, a non-zero fraction can also reach the origin. In other words, the percolation threshold for strong connectivity is equal to the threshold for one-way connectivity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Power Optimization on a Network: The effects of randomness</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider a wireless network of transmitter-receiver. The transmitters adjust their powers to maintain a particular SINR target in the presence of interference from neighboring transmitters. In this paper we analyze the optimal power vector that may achieve this target in the presence of randomness in the network. Specifically, we take a regular grid of transmitter-receiver pairs and randomly turn-off a finite fraction of them. We apply concepts from random matrix theory to evaluate the asymptotic mean optimal power per link, as well as its variance. Our analytical results show remarkable agreement with numerically generated networks, not only in one-dimensional network arrays but also in two dimensional network geometries. Remarkably, we observe that the optimal power in random networks does not go to infinity in a continuous fashion as in regular grids. Rather, beyond a certain point, no finite power solution exists.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Cooperation versus Interference in Large Wireless Relay Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper investigates the potential gain of cooperation in large wireless networks with multiple sources and relays, where the nodes form an homogeneous Poisson point process. The source nodes may choose their nearest neighbor from the set of inactive nodes as their relay. Although cooperation can potentially lead to significant improvements on the asymptotic error probability of a communication pair, relaying causes additional interference in the network, increasing the average noise. We address the basic question: how should source nodes optimally balance cooperation vs. interference to guarantee reliability in all communication pairs. Based on the decode-and-forward (DF) scheme at the relays, we derive closed-form approximations to the upper bounds on the error probability, averaging over all node positions. Surprisingly, in the small outage probability regime, there is an almost binary behavior that dictates -depending on network parameters- the activation or not of all relay nodes.</abstract>

&#13;
We study the interference and outage statistics in a slotted Aloha ad hoc network, where the spatial distribution of nodes is non-stationary and isotropic. In such a network, outage probability and local throughput depend on both the particular location in the network and the shape of the spatial distribution. We derive in closed-form certain distributional properties of the interference that are important for analyzing wireless networks as a function of the location and the spatial shape. Our results focus on path loss exponents $2$ and $4$, the former case not being analyzable before due to the stationarity assumption of the spatial node distribution. We propose two metrics for measuring local throughput in non-stationary networks and discuss how our findings can be applied to both analysis and optimization.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Capacity Achieving Linear Codes with Random Binary Sparse Generating Matrices over the Binary Symmetric Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>[THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD]&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, we prove the existence of capacity achieving linear codes with random binary sparse generating matrices over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). The results on the existence of capacity achieving linear codes in the literature are limited to the random binary codes with equal probability generating matrix elements and sparse parity-check matrices. Moreover, the codes with sparse generating matrices reported in the literature are not proved to be capacity achieving for channels other than Binary Erasure Channel. As opposed to the existing results in the literature, which are based on optimal maximum a posteriori decoders, the proposed approach is based on a different decoder and consequently is suboptimal. We also demonstrate an interesting trade-off between the sparsity of the generating matrix and the error exponent (a constant which determines how exponentially fast the probability of error decays as block length tends to infinity). Based on our results, we also propose a channel coding rate achievable by linear codes at a given block length and error probability. Moreover, we prove the existence of capacity achieving linear codes with a given (arbitrarily low) density of ones on rows of the generating matrix. In addition to proving the existence of capacity achieving sparse codes, an important conclusion of our paper is to prove that any arbitrarily selected sequence of sparse generating matrices is capacity achieving with high probability.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Nested Lattice Codes for Arbitrary Continuous Sources and Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we show that nested lattice codes achieve the capacity of arbitrary continuous channels with or without non-causal state information at the transmitter. We also show that nested lattice codes are optimal for source coding with or without non-causal side information at the receiver for arbitrary continuous sources. We show the optimality of lattice codes for the Gelfand-Pinsker and Wyner-Ziv problems in their most general settings.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Codes Over Non-Abelian Groups: Point-to-Point Communications and Computation Over MAC</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we show that good structured codes over non-Abelian groups do exist. Specifically, we construct codes over the smallest non-Abelian group $\mathds{D}_6$ and show that the performance of these codes is superior to the performance of Abelian group codes of the same alphabet size. This promises the possibility of using non-Abelian codes for multi-terminal settings where the structure of the code can be exploited to gain performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Observability, Controllability and Local Reducibility of Linear Codes on Graphs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper is concerned with the local reducibility properties of linear realizations of codes on finite graphs.&#13;
&#13;
Trimness and properness are dual properties of constraint codes. A linear realization is locally reducible if any constraint code is not both trim and proper. On a finite cycle-free graph, a linear realization is minimal if and only if every constraint code is both trim and proper. &#13;
&#13;
A linear realization is called observable if it is one-to-one, and controllable if all constraints are independent. Observability and controllability are dual properties. An unobservable or uncontrollable realization is locally reducible. A parity-check realization is uncontrollable if and only if it has redundant parity checks. A tail-biting trellis realization is uncontrollable if and only if its trajectories partition into disconnected subrealizations. General graphical realizations do not share this property.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>It is shown that a trellis realization can be locally reduced if it is not state-trim, branch-trim, proper, observable, and controllable. These conditions are not sufficient for local irreducibility. Making use of notions that amount to ``almost unobservability/uncontrollability'', a necessary and sufficient criterion of local irreducibility for tail-biting trellises is presented.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Importance of Symbol Equity in Coded Modulation for Power Line Communications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The use of multiple frequency shift keying modulation with permutation codes addresses the problem of permanent narrowband noise disturbance in a power line communications system. In this paper, we extend this coded modulation scheme based on permutation codes to general codes and introduce an additional new parameter that helps to more precisely capture a code's performance against permanent narrowband noise. As a result, we define a new class of codes, namely, equitable symbol weight codes, which are optimal with respect to this measure. In addition, we demonstrate via simulations that equitable symbol weight codes achieve lower symbol error rates than other codes of the same length and distance over the same alphabet.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Equitable Symbol Weight Codes for Power Line Communications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The use of multiple frequency shift keying modula- tion with permutation codes addresses the problem of permanent narrowband noise disturbance in a power line communications (PLC) system. Equitable symbol weight codes was recently demonstrated to optimize the performance against narrowband noise in a general coded modulation scheme. This paper estab- lishes the first infinite family of optimal equitable symbol weight codes with code lengths greater than alphabet size and whose relative narrowband noise error-correcting capabilities do not diminish to zero as the length grows. These families of codes meet the Plotkin bound. The construction method introduced is combinatorial and reveals interesting interplay with an extension of the concept of generalized balanced tournament designs from combinatorial design theory.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Codes for Locating Objects in Sensor Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin introduced identifying codes, which can be applied, for example, to locating objects in sensor networks. In this paper, the underlying structure is $\Z^2$ where one sensor can check its neighbours within Euclidean distance $r$. We construct identifying codes in this network that are robust against some changes in the neighbourhood monitored by each sensor. We give bounds for the smallest density of such an identifying code for general values of $r$. We also provide infinite families of values $r$ with optimal such codes and study the case of small values of $r$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>New lower bounds for identifying codes in infinite grids</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The concept of identifying codes was introduced by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin in 1998. Their original motivation for studying these codes comes from fault diagnosis in multiprocessor systems. Recently, other applications such as locating objects in sensor networks have been proposed.&#13;
&#13;
We define an $r$-identifying code in a graph $G = (V,E)$ as a subset $C \subseteq V$ such that for each $u \in V$ the intersection of $C$ and the ball of radius $r$ centered at $u$ is nonempty and unique. Since the seminal paper on the subject, determining the smallest densities of identifying codes in various infinite grids has been one of the essential problems in the field. In this paper, we consider $2$-identifying codes in the infinite square and hexagonal grids.&#13;
&#13;
Previously, it has been shown that there exists a $2$-identifying code in the square grid with density $5/29 \approx 0.172$ and that there are no $2$-identifying codes with density smaller than $3/20 = 0.15$. Recently, the lower bound has been improved to $6/37 \approx 0.162$ by Martin and Stanton (2010). We further improve the lower bound by showing that there are no $2$-identifying codes in the square grid with density smaller than $6/35 \approx 0.171$.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, there exists a $2$-identifying code in the hexagonal grid with density $4/19 \approx 0.211$. Currently, the best known lower bound for this case is $1/5 = 0.2$ by Martin and Stanton (2010). We improve this lower bound to $4/19$, i.e. show that the construction with density $4/19$ is optimal.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Improved Upper Bounds on the Capacity of Binary Channels with Causal Adversaries</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work we consider the communication of information in the presence of a {\em causal} adversarial jammer. In the setting under study, a sender wishes to communicate a message to a receiver by transmitting a codeword $\bx=(x_1,\dots,x_\bl)$ bit-by-bit over a communication channel. The adversarial jammer can view the transmitted bits $x_i$ one at a time, and can change up to a $p$-fraction of them. However, the decisions of the jammer must be made in a {\em causal} manner. Namely, for each bit $x_i$ the jammer's decision on whether to corrupt it or not (and on how to change it) must depend only on $x_j$ for $j \leq i$. This is in contrast to the ``classical'' adversarial jammer which may base its decisions on its complete knowledge of $\bx$. Binary channels with causal adversarial jammers have seen recent studies in which both lower bounds and upper bounds on their capacity is derived. In this work, we present improved upper bounds on the capacity which hold for both deterministic and stochastic encoding schemes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Finding the Capacity of a Quantized Binary-Input DMC</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider a binary-input, $M$-output discrete memoryless channel (DMC) where the outputs are quantized to $K$ levels, with $K &lt; M$. The subject of this paper is the maximization of mutual information between the input and quantizer output, over both the input distribution and channel quantizer. This can be regarded as finding the capacity of a quantized DMC. An algorithm is given, which either finds the optimal input distribution and corresponding quantizer, or declares a failure.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Capacity of Binary Input Symmetric q-ary Output Channels with Synchronization Errors</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we develop several lower bounds on the capacity of binary input symmetric q-ary output channels with synchronization errors, e.g. substitution/erasure channels with synchronization errors. More precisely, we show that if the channel with synchronization errors can be decomposed into a cascade of two channels where only the first one suffers from synchronization errors, a lower bound on the capacity of the original channel related to the capacity of the one with only synchronization errors can be given. We present several examples with the new approach and demonstrate that for certain channels, e.g., deletion/substitution channel, it is possible to derive tighter capacity lower bounds than the existing ones.</abstract>

        <abstract>We study the relation of the mutual information and relative entropy over the Binomial and Negative Binomial channels with estimation theoretical quantities, in which we extend already known results for Gaussian and Poisson channels. We establish general expressions for these information theory concepts with a direct connection with estimation theory through the conditional mean estimation and a particular loss function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Pointwise Relations between Information and Estimation in Gaussian Noise</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Many of the classical and recent relations between information and estimation in the presence of Gaussian noise can be viewed as identities between expectations of random quantities. These include the I-MMSE relationship of Guo et al.; the relative entropy and mismatched estimation relationship of Verd\'{u}; the relationship between causal estimation and mutual information of Duncan, and its extension to the presence of feedback by Kadota et al.; the relationship between causal and non-casual estimation of Guo et al., and its mismatched version of Weissman. We dispense with the expectations and explore the nature of the pointwise relations between the respective random quantities. The pointwise relations that we find are as succinctly stated as - and give considerable insight into - the original expectation identities. &#13;
&#13;
As an illustration of our results, consider Duncan's 1970 discovery that the mutual information is equal to the causal MMSE in the AWGN channel, which can equivalently be expressed saying that the difference between the input-output information density and half the causal estimation error is a zero mean random variable (regardless of the distribution of the channel input). We characterize this random variable explicitly, rather than merely its expectation. Classical estimation and information theoretic quantities emerge with new and surprising roles. For example, the variance of this random variable turns out to be given by the causal MMSE (which, in turn, is equal to the mutual information by Duncan's result).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Estimation with a helper who knows the interference</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of estimating a signal corrupted by independent interference in which the estimator (decoder) is aided by a helper (encoder) with a limited power budget that has knowledge of the interfering signal noncausally. In the Gaussian case, this problem is equivalent to the problem of Assisted Interference Suppression considered by Grover and Sahai and we give an improved lower bound for this problem based on Verdu's relationship between mismatched estimation and divergence. We also extend our analysis to consider the case when the signal to be estimated, in addition to the interference, is known to the helper. We establish a lower bound that improves on those recently derived by Huang and Narayanan.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rate Distortion Codes for the Collective Estimation from Independent Noisy Observations</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We present a collective behavior in the optimal aggregation of noisy observations for a source. The quality of estimation involves a difficult tradeoff between sensing quality which increases by increasing the number of sensors, and aggregation quality which decreases if the number of sensors is too large. We analytically study the optimal strategy for large scale aggregation, and obtain an explicit and exact result by introducing a toy model. We show that larger scale aggregation always outperforms smaller scale aggregation at higher noise levels, while below a critical value of noise, there exist moderate scale aggregation levels at which optimal estimation is realized. The behavior of optimal aggregation level is reminiscent of that of order parameters at a continuous phase transition in statistical mechanics.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Mismatched MMSE Estimation of Multivariate Gaussian Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The distortion increase in MMSE estimation of multivariate Gaussian sources is analyzed for the situation in which the statistics are mismatched, i.e., the covariance matrix is not perfectly known during the estimation process. First a deterministic mismatch model with an additive perturbation matrix is considered, for which we provide closed form expressions of the distortion excess caused by the mismatch. The mismatch study is then generalized by using random matrix theory tools which allow an asymptotic result for a broad class of perturbation matrices to be proved.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Classical codes for quantum broadcast channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We discuss two techniques for transmitting classical information over quantum broadcast channels. The first technique is a quantum generalization of the superposition coding scheme for the classical broadcast channel. We use a quantum simultaneous nonunique decoder and obtain a simpler proof of the rate region recently published by Yard et al. in independent work. Our second result is a quantum Marton coding scheme, which gives the best known achievable rate region for quantum broadcast channels. Both results exploit recent advances in quantum simultaneous decoding developed in the context of quantum interference channels.&#13;

        <papertitle>Partial decode-forward for quantum relay channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A relay channel is one in which a Source and Destination use an intermediate Relay station in order to improve communication rates. We propose the study of relay channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs and prove that a &quot;partial decode and forward&quot; strategy is achievable. We divide the channel uses into many blocks and build codes in a randomized, block-Markov manner within each block. The Relay performs a standard Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland quantum measurement on each block in order to decode part of the Source's message and then forwards this partial message in the next block. The Destination performs a novel &quot;sliding-window&quot; quantum measurement on two adjacent blocks in order to decode the Source's message. This strategy achieves non-trivial rates for classical communication over a quantum relay channel.&#13;

        <papertitle>Achieving the Han-Kobayashi inner bound for the quantum interference channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We construct an encoding and decoding scheme achieving the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound for a two sender two receiver interference channel with classical input and quantum output. This automatically gives a similar inner bound for sending classical information through an interference channel with quantum inputs and outputs without entanglement assistance. Our result matches the best known inner bound for the interference channel in the classical setting. Achieving the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound, which is known to be equivalent to the Han-Kobayashi inner bound, answers an open question raised recently by Fawzi, Hayden, Savov, Sen and Wilde.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Effect of Zero-rate Encoders in the Multi-terminal Source Coding Problem</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This work focuses on the multi-terminal source coding problem and presents conditions when a rate point achievable with asymptotically zero-rate messages over a subset of network links, is also achievable with no communication over links in that subset. We show that when there exist block codes that are robust to small changes in the source distribution, zero-rate encoders can be ignored, i.e., their outgoing links can be assumed to be absent. Additionally, we show that when the decoder is given access to the strictly causal past realizations of the sources, zero-rate encoders can always be ignored.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multiterminal Source Coding under Logarithmic Loss</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the two-encoder multiterminal source coding problem subject to distortion constraints computed under logarithmic loss. We provide a single-letter description of the achievable rate distortion region for arbitrarily correlated sources with finite alphabets. In doing so, we also give the rate distortion region for the CEO problem under logarithmic loss. Notably, the Berger-Tung inner bound is tight in both settings.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Cooperation in Multi-Terminal Computation and Rate Distortion</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A receiver wants to compute a function of two correlated sources separately observed by two transmitters. One of the transmitters is allowed to cooperate with the other transmitter by sending it some data before both transmitters convey information to the receiver. Assuming noiseless communication, what is the minimum number of bits that needs to be communicated by each transmitter to the receiver for a given number of cooperation bits?&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, first a general inner bound to the above three dimensional rate region is provided and shown to be tight in a number of interesting settings: the function is partially invertible, full cooperation, one-round point-to-point communication, two-round point-to-point communication, and cascade. &#13;
&#13;
Second, the related Kaspi-Berger rate distortion problem is investigated where the receiver now wants to recover the sources within some distortion. By using ideas developed for establishing the above inner bound, a new rate distortion inner bound is proposed. This bound always includes the time sharing of Kaspi-Berger's inner bounds and inclusion is strict in certain cases.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Polynomials and Computing Functions of Correlated Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&#13;
&#13;
We consider the source coding problem of computing functions of correlated sources, which is an extension of the Slepian--Wolf coding problem. We observe that all the discrete functions are in fact restrictions of polynomial functions over some finite field. Based on this observation, we demonstrate how to use Elias' Lemma to enlarge the coding rate region (compared to the Slepian--Wolf region) for a certain class of polynomial functions.&#13;
&#13;
We present a classification result about polynomial functions regarding this coding problem. The result is conclusive in the two-sources scenario and, in fact, gives another interpretation of a result by Han and Kobayashi [6, Theorem 1].</abstract>

        <papertitle>An upper bound on relaying over capacity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The upper bound on the capacity of a 3-node discrete memoryless relay channel is considered, where a source X wants to send information to destination Y with the help of a relay Z. Y and Z are independent given X, and the channel is statistically degraded in the sense that XYZ or XZY can be re-described statistically as a Markov chain. The link from Z to Y is lossless with rate R0. A new method is introduced to bound the capacity when the encoding rate is beyond both individual links XY and XZ. It generalizes the well-known blowing-up lemma and links it with conditional entropy. The new bound is explicitly computable and strictly better than the well-known cut-set bound when the latter is C_{XY}+R0. The binary erasure channel is analyzed in detail as an example, and generalization to more cases is also discussed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Buffer-Aided Relaying in a Three Node Network</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We propose a buffer-aided relaying protocol for a three node relay network comprised of a source, a half-duplex relay with buffer, and a destination. We assume a direct source-destination link is available and all links undergo fading. The proposed protocol enables the half-duplex relay to choose its reception and transmission time slots adaptively and based on the quality of the involved links. We derive the achievable ergodic rate of the considered three-node network for the proposed protocol. Our results show that this achievable ergodic rate exceeds existing unachievable ergodic capacity upper bounds for the three-node half-duplex relay channel with the relay always alternating between reception and transmission.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Capacity Region of Restricted Multi-Way Relay Channels with Deterministic Uplinks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper considers the multi-way relay channel (MWRC) where multiple users exchange messages via a single relay. The capacity region is derived for a special class of MWRCs where (i) the uplink and the downlink are separated in the sense that there is no direct user-to-user links, (ii) the channel is restricted in the sense that each user's transmitted channel symbols can depend on only its own message, but not on its received channel symbols, and (iii) the uplink is any deterministic function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Finite Field Multi-Way Relay Channel with Correlated Sources: Beyond Three Users</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The multi-way relay channel (MWRC) models cooperative communication networks in which many users exchange messages via a relay. In this paper, we consider the finite field MWRC with correlated messages. The problem is to find all achievable rates, defined as the number of channel uses required per reliable exchange of message tuple. For the case of three users, we have previously established that for a special class of source distributions, the set of all achievable rates can be found [Ong et al., ISIT 2010]. The class is specified by an almost balanced conditional mutual information (ABCMI) condition. In this paper, we first generalize the ABCMI condition to the case of more than three users. We then show that if the sources satisfy the ABCMI condition, then the set of all achievable rates is found and can be attained using a separate source-channel coding architecture.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Reliable versus Unreliable Transmission for Energy Efficient Transmission in Relay Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A network code is said to be reliable when all transmissions in the network are (deterministic) functions of the source messages; well-known examples include decode-forward for relay networks. It is said to be unreliable when transmissions depend on the noise realization at nodes; examples include compress-forward and amplify-forward. The deterministic capacity of a network is defined as the supremum of the rates achievable by reliable codes. In this paper we derive the deterministic capacity of a some relay networks in the low power regime. The resulting energy per bit is then compared with the one achievable by arbitrary transmission.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Bounds on the Minimum Energy-Per-Bit for Bursty Traffic in Diamond Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. When data traffic in a wireless network is bursty, small amounts of data sporadically become available for transmission, and the energy cost associated with synchronizing the network nodes prior to each communication block is not negligible. Therefore, designing energy-efficient communication schemes for such asynchronous scenarios is of particular importance. In this paper, we show that, for symmetric diamond networks, by performing the tasks of synchronization and communication separately, it is possible to achieve the minimum energy-per-bit to within a factor that ranges from 2 in the synchronous case to 1 in the highly asynchronous regime.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Impact of Channel and Source Variations on the Energy Efficiency under QoS Constraints</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Energy efficiency in wireless fading channels is studied in the presence of statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints. Energy per bit is employed as the performance metric. Minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions are determined to quantify the energy efficiency in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In particular, the impact of channel and source variations is investigated. A block-fading model in which fading coefficients are arbitrarily correlated in one block before assuming independent realizations in the next one, is considered. Initially, the effect of fading correlation on energy efficiency is analyzed. It is shown that while minimum energy per bit does not depend on the fading correlation, wideband slope decreases as positive correlation increases, resulting in increased energy requirements at low but nonzero SNR levels. Subsequently, an ON-OFF source arrival model is considered. It is shown that while the minimum energy per bit does not get affected by source variations, wideband slope diminishes with increasing source burstiness.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy Efficient Greedy Link Scheduling and Power Control in wireless networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of joint link scheduling and power control for wireless networks with average transmission power constraints. Due to the high computational complexity of the optimal policies, we extend the class of greedy link scheduling policies to handle average power constraints. We develop a greedy link scheduling and power control scheme GECS, with provable performance guarantees. We show that the performance of our greedy scheduler can be characterized using the Local Pooling Factor (LPF) of a network graph, which has been previously used to characterize the stability of the Greedy Maximal Scheduling (GMS) policy for wireless networks. We also simulate the performance of GECS on wireless network, and compare its performance to another candidate greedy link scheduling and power control policy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Second-Order Achievable Rates in Random Number Generation for Mixed Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The second-order achievable rates in typical random number generation problems are considered. In these problems, several researchers have derived the first-order and the second-order achievability rates for general sources using the information-spectrum methods. Although these formulas are general, their computation are quite hard. Hence, an attempt to address explicit computation problems of achievable rates is meaningful. In this paper, we consider mixed sources of two i.i.d. sources and compute the second-order achievable rates explicitly on the basis of two-peak asymptotic normality.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper is focused on the moderate-deviations analysis of binary hypothesis testing. The analysis relies on a concentration inequality for discrete-parameter martingales with bounded jumps, where this inequality forms a refinement to the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. Relations of the analysis to the moderate deviations principle for i.i.d. random variables and to the relative entropy are considered.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Log-Volume of Optimal Constant-Composition Codes for Memoryless Channels, Within O(1) Bits</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper derives a tight asymptotic upper bound on the maximum volume $M_{cc}^*(n,\epsilon)$ of length-$n$ constant-composition codes subject to an average decoding error probability $\epsilon$: $\overline{M}_{cc}(n,\epsilon) = \exp\{nC - \sqrt{nV} \,Q^{-1}(\epsilon) + \frac{1}{2} \log n + A_{n,\epsilon} + o(1)\}$ where $A_{n,\epsilon}$ is a bounded sequence that can be explicitly identified and reduces to a constant in the nonlattice case. A matching lower bound is presented, differing from the upper bound by a small multiplying constant. These expressions hold under certain regularity assumptions on the channel.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper studies the maximum achievable rate region of multiple access channels (MAC) for a given blocklength n and a desired error probability epsilon. The inner region for the discrete memoryless MAC is approximated by a single-lettered expression I-Q_inv(V,epsilon) where I is associated with the capacity pentagon bounds by Ahlswede and Liao, V is the MAC dispersion matrix, and Q_inv is the complementary multivariate Gaussian cumulative distribution region. For outer regions, we provide general converse bounds for both average error probability and maximum error probability criteria, and a single-lettered approximation for the discrete memoryless MAC.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Symmetric L1 distance error control codes and elementary symmetric functions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Based on the elementary symmetric functions, this paper gives a new wide class of Goppa like codes capable of correcting/detecting errors measured under the (symmetric) L1 distance defined over the m-ary words, 2&lt;=m&lt;=+\infty. All these codes can be efficiently decoded by algebraic means with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA). In particular it is shown that if K is any field with characteristic char(K)!=2, m in N\cup\{+\infty\}$ and n,t in N then there exist m-ary codes C of length n&lt;=(|K|-1)/2 and cardinality |C|&gt;=m^{n}/|K|^{t} which are capable of, say, correcting t errors (i. e., the minimum L1 distance of C is d_{L1}(C)&gt;=2t+1) with t steps of EEA. Also, if K is a finite field and 2t+1&lt;=char(K)!=2 then some of these codes are (essentially) linear and, hence, easy to encode.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On symmetric/asymmetric Lee distance error control codes and elementary symmetric functions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper gives some new theory and design of codes capable of correcting/detecting errors measured under the Lee distance defined over m-ary words, m in N. Based on the elementary symmetric functions (instead of the power sums), a key equation is derived which can be used to design new symmetric (or, asymmetric) error control algorithms for some new and already known error control codes for the Lee metric. In particular, it is shown that if K is any field with characteristic p, p odd, and u,h,n,m=up^{h},t in N are such that n&lt;=(|K|-1)/2 and t&lt;=(p^{h}-1)/2 then there exist m-ary codes C of length n and cardinality |C|&gt;=m^{n}/|K|^{t} which are capable of, say, correcting t symmetric errors (i. e., the minimum Lee distance of C is d_{Lee}(C)&gt;=2t+1) with t steps of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. Furthermore, if t&lt;=(p-1)/2 then some of these codes are (essentially) linear and, hence, easy to encode.</abstract>

        <papertitle>New Constructions of Codes for Asymmetric Channels via Concatenation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We present new constructions of codes for asymmetric channels for both binary and nonbinary alphabets, based on methods of generalized code concatenation. For the binary asymmetric channel, our methods construct nonlinear single-error-correcting codes from ternary outer codes. We show that some of the Varshamov-Tenengol'ts-Constantin-Rao codes, a class of binary nonlinear codes for this channel, have a nice structure when viewed as ternary codes. In many cases, our ternary construction yields even better codes. For the nonbinary asymmetric channel, our methods construct linear codes for many lengths and distances which are superior to the linear codes of the same length capable of correcting the same number of symmetric errors.&#13;
&#13;
In the binary case, Varshamov has shown that almost all good linear codes for the asymmetric channel are also good for the symmetric channel. Our results indicate that Varshamov's argument does not extend to the nonbinary case, i.e., one can find better linear codes for asymmetric channels than for symmetric ones.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Hyper-bent functions via Dillon-like exponents</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper is devoted to hyper-bent functions with multiple trace terms (including binomial functions) via Dillon-like exponents. We show how the approach developed by Mesnager to extend the Charpin-Gong family and subsequently extended by Wang et al. fits in a much more general setting.&#13;
&#13;
To this end, we first explain how the original restriction for Charpin-Gong criterion can be weakened before generalizing the Mesnager approach to arbitrary Dillon-like exponents. Afterward, we tackle the problem of devising infinite families of extension degrees for which a given exponent is valid and apply these results not only to reprove straightforwardly the results of Mesnager and Wang et al., but also to characterize the hyper-bentness of new infinite classes of Boolean functions.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>New quadratic bent functions in polynomial forms are constructed in this paper. The constructions give new boolean bent and generalized boolean bent functions. Based on $\mathbb{Z}_4$-valued quadratic forms, a simple method provides several new constructions of generalized boolean bent functions. From these generalized boolean bent functions a method is presented to transform them into binary bent and semi-bent functions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Optimal Sampling Technique for Distinguishing Random S-boxes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The nonrandom behavior of the outputs of a random S-box can be exploited when constructing distinguishers for cryptographic primitives. Different methods of constructing samples from the outputs have been used in the literature. However, it has been unclear exactly how these methods differ and which method is optimal. We analyze four different sampling techniques. We show that two of these sampling techniques result in dependent samples. We further show one sampling technique that is optimal in terms of error probabilities in the resulting distinguisher. However, this sampling technique is quite impractical as it requires very large storage. We further show a fourth sampling technique that is much more practical, and we show that it is equivalent to the optimal one. We also show an improved algorithm for calculating the associated probability distributions that are required for the attack.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Cross-Recurrence Property of m-Sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A binary maximal length sequence (m-sequence) of period L = 2m - 1 can be generated by a binary m-stage linear feedback shift-register (LFSR). Tap connections of the LFSR corresponds to a binary primitive polynomial of degree m. m-sequences enjoy several well-known and unique properties. A new property for m-sequences, called cross-recurrence property, is presented in this paper and its potential applications are briefly outlined.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Channel Capacity under General Nonuniform Sampling</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper develops the fundamental capacity limits of a sampled analog channel under a sub-Nyquist sampling rate constraint. In particular, we derive the capacity of sampled analog channels over a general class of time-preserving sampling methods including irregular nonuniform sampling. Our results indicate that the optimal sampling structures extract out the set of frequencies that exhibits the highest SNR among all spectral sets of support size equal to the sampling rate. The capacity under sub-Nyquist sampling can be attained through filter-bank sampling, or through a single branch of modulation and filtering followed by uniform sampling. The capacity under sub-Nyquist sampling is a monotone function of the sampling rate. These results indicate that the optimal sampling schemes suppress aliasing, and that employing irregular nonuniform sampling does not provide capacity gain over uniform sampling sets with appropriate preprocessing for a large class of channels.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Continuous Time Channels with Interference</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Inspired by work of Khanna and Sudan \cite{KS11}, we consider a taxonomy of channels that model \emph{continuous time} communication with \emph{adversarial} delay errors. In these channels, the sender is allowed to subdivide each time step into an arbitrarily many micro-units in which $\{0, 1\}$ signals may be sent, but the signals are subject to unpredictable delays. A novelty of our model is that we capture a spectrum of \emph{interference} behaviors: a $k$-interference channel outputs the value $\min(j, k)$ at time $t$, where $j$ is the number of 1s that arrive during the $t$'th micro-unit of time. We consider two types of adversaries, one that has a limit $D_{\text{max}}$ on the number of steps it can delay any particular symbol, and a more powerful adversary that only has a bound on the average delay, $D_{\text{avg}}$. The amount of delay the adversary is allowed to introduce for a $k$-interference channel is a function of $k$ and $M$, where $M$ is the number of micro-units into which each time step is divided. In both settings, we precisely characterize the threshold where the capacity of the channel goes from finite to infinite. For max-bounded delay, we observe a sharp threshold at $D_{\text{max}}=\Theta\left(M \log\left(\min\{k, M\}\right \right)$, and for average bounded delay we observe a threshold at $D_{\text{avg}} = \Theta\left(\sqrt{M \cdot \min\{k, M\}}\right)$. Note that, in the presence of interference (i.e if $k$ is small), the capacity is finite even for rather small average delay.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Establishing the Shannon Ordering for Discrete Memoryless Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper studies several problems concerning channel inclusion, which is a partial ordering between discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) proposed by Shannon. Specifically, checkable conditions are derived for channel inclusion between DMCs with certain special structure, and these conditions are related to the mathematical theory of majorization. The conditions for channel inclusion between binary erasure channel (BEC) and binary symmetric channel (BSC) are also derived, which are shown to be equivalent to those for channel output degradation. Furthermore, the determination of channel inclusion is considered as a convex optimization problem, and the sparsity of the weights related to the representation of the worse DMC in terms of the better one is revealed when channel inclusion holds between two DMCs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Ergodic Capacity Ordering of Fading Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic order relevant to information theory, known as the capacity order. We say that a fading channel dominates another in the capacity ordering sense, if the ergodic capacity of the first is greater than that of the second at all values of average SNR. We show that the instantaneous SNR of many parametric fading models such as the Nakagami-m, Rician and Hoyt fading satisfy the capacity order, each with respect to their line of sight parameters. Further, we observe that the end-to-end instantaneous SNRs of composite systems such as maximum ratio combining and equal gain combining are Thorin-Bernstein functions, whose connection with capacity ordering is systematically exploited to show that these systems have a higher ergodic capacity whenever the each component has a higher ergodic capacity. We also show that capacity ordering of point-to-point links has implications in multi-user information theory. As an example, we establish that when comparing the ergodic capacity region of a Gaussian multiple access channel in two fading scenarios, a larger capacity region is obtained for the case when the instantaneous SNR between each user and the receiver in the first fading scenario dominates its counterpart in the other, in the capacity ordering sense.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Penalized Maximum Likelihood Methods for Finite Memory Estimators of Infinite Memory Processes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Stationary ergodic processes with finite alphabets are estimated by finite memory processes from a sample, an n-length realization of the process. Both the transition probabilities and the memory depth of the estimator process are estimated from the sample using penalized maximum likelihood (PML). Under some assumptions on the continuity rate and the assumption of non-nullness, a rate of convergence in d-bar distance is obtained, with explicit constants. The results show an optimality of the PML Markov order estimator for not necessarily finite memory processes. Moreover, the notion of consistent Markov order estimation is generalized for infinite memory processes using the concept of oracle order estimates, and generalized consistency of the PML Markov order estimator is presented.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Minimax prediction of binary sequences is investigated for cases in which the predictor is forced to issue a piecewise constant prediction. The minimax strategy is characterized for Hamming loss whereas, for logarithmic loss, an asymptotically minimax strategy which achieves the leading term of the asymptotic minimax redundancy, is proposed. The average redundancy case is also analyzed for i.i.d. distributions. The piecewise constant prediction paradigm may be of relevance to resource constrained settings.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Efficient Tracking of Large Classes of Experts</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In the framework of prediction with expert advice we consider prediction algorithms that compete against a class of switching strategies that can segment a given sequence into several blocks and follow the advice of a different ``base'' expert in each block. The performance is measured by the regret defined as the excess loss relative to the best switching strategy selected in hindsight. Our goal is to construct low-complexity prediction algorithms for the case where the set of base experts is large. In particular, starting with an arbitrary prediction algorithm $\A$ designed for the base expert class, we derive a family of efficient tracking algorithms that can be implemented with time and space complexity only $O(n^{\gamma} \ln n)$ times larger than that of $\A$, where $n$ is the time horizon and $\gamma \ge 0$ is a parameter of the algorithm. With $\A$ properly chosen, our algorithm achieves a regret bound of optimal order for $\gamma&gt;0$, and only $O(\ln n)$ times larger than the optimal order for $\gamma=0$ for all typical regret bound types we examined. For example, for predicting binary sequences with switching parameters, our method achieves the optimal $O(\ln n)$ regret rate with time complexity $O(n^{1+\gamma}\ln n)$ for any $\gamma\in (0,1)$.</abstract>

        <abstract>We treat secret key extraction when the eavesdropper has correlated quantum states. We propose quantum privacy amplification theorems different from Renner's, which are based on quantum conditional Renyi entropy of order 1+s. Using those theorems, we derive an exponential decreasing rate for leaked information and the asymptotic equivocation rate.</abstract>

        <abstract>A usual code for quantum wiretap channel requires an auxiliary random variable subject to the perfect uniform distribution. However, it is difficult to prepare such an auxiliary random variable. We propose a code that requires only an auxiliary random variable subject to a non-uniform distribution instead of the perfect uniform distribution. Further, we evaluate the exponential decreasing rate of leaked information.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Entanglement Cost of Quantum Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A natural question in characterizing the information theoretic power of quantum channels is to ask at what rate entanglement is needed in order to asymptotically simulate a quantum channel in the presence of free classical communication. We call this the entanglement cost of a channel, and prove a formula describing it for all channels. We discuss two applications. Firstly, we are able to link the security in the noisy-storage model to a problem of sending quantum rather than classical information through the adversary's storage device. This not only greatly improves the range of parameters where security could be shown previously, but allows us to prove security for storage devices for which no non-trivial statements were known before. Secondly, our result has consequences for the study of the strong converse quantum capacity. Here, we show that any coding scheme that sends quantum information through a quantum channel at a rate larger than the entanglement cost of the channel has an exponentially small fidelity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Mutually unbiased bases as submodules and subspaces</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) have been used in several cryptographic and communications applications. There has been much speculation regarding connections between MUBs and finite geometries. Most of which has focused on a connection with projective and affine planes. We propose a connection with higher dimensional projective geometries and projective Hjelmslev geometries. We show that this proposed geometric structure is present in several constructions of MUBs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Simple Technique for Bounding the Redundancy of Source Coding with Side Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A simple technique for bounding the redundancy of Slepian-Wolf coding is given. We demonstrate that our simple technique gives the tight bound established by He et al. Our proof is so simple that it can be easily extended to the case where the source $(X^n,Y^n)$ has an $n$-fold product distribution (i.e., $(X_1,Y_1),\dots,(X_n,Y_n)$ are independent but not necessarily identically distributed). It can be also applied to Wyner-Ahlswede-Korner coding and gives novel bounds of the redundancies of the coding rates of the encoder and the helper.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Dispersion of Slepian-Wolf Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We characterize second-order coding rates (or dispersions) for distributed lossless source coding (the Slepian-Wolf problem). We introduce a fundamental quantity known as the entropy dispersion matrix, which is analogous to scalar dispersion quantities. We show that if this matrix is positive-definite, the optimal rate region under the constraint of a fixed blocklength and non-zero error probability has a curved boundary compared to being polyhedral for the Slepian-Wolf case. In addition, the entropy dispersion matrix governs the rate of convergence of the non-asymptotic region to the asymptotic one. As a by-product of our analyses, we develop a general universal achievability procedure for dispersion analysis of some other network information theory problems such as the multiple-access channel. Numerical examples show how the region given by Gaussian approximations compares to the Slepian-Wolf region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Moderate-Deviations of Lossy Source Coding for Discrete and Gaussian Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the moderate-deviations (MD) setting for lossy source coding of stationary memoryless sources. More specifically, we derive fundamental compression limits of source codes whose rates are R(D) \pm \epsilon_n, where R(D) is the rate-distortion function and \epsilon_n is a sequence that dominates \sqrt{1/n}. This MD setting is complementary to the large-deviations and central limit settings and was studied by Altug and Wagner for the channel coding setting. We show, for finite alphabet and Gaussian sources, that as in the central limit-type results, the so-called dispersion for lossy source coding plays a fundamental role in the MD setting for the lossy source coding problem.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Relations Between Redundancy Patterns of the Shannon Code and Wave Diffraction Patterns of Partially Disordered Media</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The average redundancy of the Shannon code, $R_n$, as a function of the block length $n$, is known to exhibit two very different types of behavior, depending on the rationality or irrationality of certain parameters of the source: It either converges to $1/2$ as $n$ grows without bound, or it may have a non-vanishing, oscillatory, (quasi-) periodic pattern around the value $1/2$ for all large $n$. In this paper, we make an attempt to shed some insight into this erratic behavior of $R_n$, by drawing an analogy with the realm of physics of wave propagation, in particular, the elementary theory of scattering and diffraction. It turns out that there are two types of behavior of wave diffraction patterns formed by crystals, which are correspondingly analogous to the two types of patterns of $R_n$. When the crystal is perfect, the diffraction intensity spectrum exhibits very sharp peaks, a.k.a. Bragg peaks, at wavelengths of full constructive interference. These wavelengths correspond to the frequencies of the harmonic waves of the oscillatory mode of $R_n$. On the other hand, when the crystal is imperfect and there is a considerable degree of disorder in its structure, the Bragg peaks disappear, and the behavior of this mode is analogous to the one where $R_n$ is convergent.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Code Design for Very Noisy Relay Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>From an information-theoretic point of view, it is well known that the capacity of relay channel comprising of three terminals is much more than that of two terminal direct channel especially for low SNRs. Previously invented relay coding strategies have not been designed to achieve this enormous capacity occurring in the low SNR region. In this paper, we propose a simple coding strategy for a relay channel with low SNRs or, equivalently, for a very noisy relay channel. The multiplicative repetition is utilized to design this simple coding strategy. We claim that the proposed strategy is simple since the destination and the relay can decode with almost the same computational complexity by sharing the same structure of decoder. An appropriate static power allocation which yields the maximum throughput close to the optimal one in low SNRs is suggested. Under practical constraints such as equal time-sharing etc., the asymptotic performance of this simple strategy is within 0.5 dB from the achievable rate of relay channel. Furthermore, the performance at short code lengths enjoys a relaying gain by approximately 1.4 dB.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Algebraic Fast-Decodable Relay Codes for Distributed Communications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, fast-decodable lattice code constructions are designed for the nonorthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. The constructions are based on different types of algebraic structures, e.g. quaternion division algebras. When satisfying certain properties, these algebras provide us with codes whose structure naturally reduces the decoding complexity. The complexity can be further reduced by shortening the block length, i.e., by considering rectangular codes called less than minimum delay (LMD) codes.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A new communication scheme for Gaussian diamond relay networks based on superposition coding and partial decoding at the relays is presented. A first level codebook is constructed with symbols chosen from a binary alphabet while a second level codebook is composed of codewords chosen with Gaussian symbols. The relays partially decode the message to identify when to amplify the incoming signals. The new communication scheme is a generalization of decode-and-forward, amplify-and-forward, and bursty-amplify-and-forward. The achievable rates are studied in the asymptotic low SNR regime. It is shown that the new scheme outperforms all previously known schemes for some channels and parameter ranges.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless Information Transfer with Opportunistic Energy Harvesting</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link with delay-limited transmission over a flat-fading channel subject to the time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus collects energy via WEH from its received interference and/or signal from the transmitter.We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any given time due to the practical circuit limitation. As a result, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference conditions. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various tradeoffs between the minimum transmission outage probability for ID and the maximum average harvested energy for EH, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called &quot;outage-energy&quot; region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control and scheduling for information and energy transfer with the receiver's mode switching. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal design of emerging wireless communication systems with opportunistic WEH.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Save-Then-Transmit Protocol for Energy Harvesting Wireless Transmitters</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, the design of a wireless communication device relying exclusively on energy harvesting is considered. Due to the inability of rechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a constraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy storage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always one ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is a random variable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A save-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time ρ (dubbed the save ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting, with the remaining fraction 1 − ρ used for data transmission. The ratio of the energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the ESD efficiency, η. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD being a battery with η &lt; 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with η = 1. The optimal ρ that minimizes outage probability is derived, and intuitive interpretations of the results are discussed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Optimal Online Policies in Energy Harvesting Systems For Compound Poisson Energy Arrivals</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of optimal transmission power for a continuous-time energy harvesting system where energy arrivals occur at random times in random amounts. We do not assume that the energy arrivals are known non-causally and consider the online setting. Here, there is a tradeoff between increasing instantaneous transmission power, which increases instantaneous transmission rate and can reduce battery overflow, and decreasing transmission power, which increases battery life and energy efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
We formulate the problem as that of maximizing the average transmission rate or throughput. We first find the non-linear relationship between the transmission power (which is a function of remaining battery energy) and the stationary distribution on the remaining battery energy. We then show that the resulting maximization problem is concave in the distribution of the remaining battery energy. This is non-trivial due to the non- linear relationship with the transmission power. We then use a calculus of variations approach to derive necessary conditions on the optimal transmission power. Specifically, we find that it must satisfy a first order non-linear autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) that has two degree of freedom for optimization purposes, one of which is the initial condition of the ODE. Solving the ODE numerically we compute achieved throughputs as a function of the battery capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy Cooperation in Energy Harvesting Wireless Communications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We consider a simple multi-hop communication scenario composed of a source node, a relay node and a destination node where the source and the relay can harvest energy from the nature. Energy required for communication arrives (is harvested) at the transmitter and an unlimited battery stores it before being consumed for transmission. In addition, the source can assist the relay by transferring a portion of its energy to the relay through a separate energy transfer unit. We address this energy cooperation between the source and the relay in a deterministic setting. Assuming that the source and the relay nodes are informed of the energy arrivals in advance, we find jointly optimal offline energy management policies for the source and the relay that maximize the end-to-end throughput. We show that this problem is a convex problem. In order to gain insight about the structure of the solution, we consider specific scenarios. In particular, we show that if the relay energy profile is higher at the beginning and lower at the end with only one intersection, then matching the power sequences of the source and the relay slot-by-slot is optimal. We also consider the case when the energy of the source is available at the beginning and show that transferring energy in the first slot is optimal.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Dynamic Intrusion Detection in Resource-Constrained Cyber Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a large-scale cyber network with N components. Each component is either in a healthy state (0) or an abnormal state (1). Due to intrusions, the state of each component transits from 0 to 1 over time according to an arbitrary stochastic process. At each time, a subset of K (K &lt; N) components are probed and those observed in abnormal states are fixed. The objective is to design the optimal scheduling for intrusion detection such that the long-term network cost incurred at all abnormal components is minimized. We formulate the problem as a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) process. We show that this class of RMAB is indexable, and Whittle index can be obtained in closed form. For homogeneous networks, we show that Whittle index policy achieves the optimal performance with a simple structure that does not require any prior knowledge on the intrusion processes. These results also apply to scheduling in queuing networks with finite-size buffers.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Byzantine Attack Defender: the Conditional Frequency Check</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Collaborative spectrum sensing is vulnerable to the Byzantine attack. Existing reputation based countermeasures will become incapable when malicious users dominate the network. Also, there is a scarcity of methods that fully explore the Markov property of the spectrum states to restrain sensors' statistical misbehaviors. In this paper, a new malicious user detection method based on two proposed Conditional Frequency Check (CFC) statistics is developed with a Markovian spectrum model. With the assistance of one trusted sensor, the proposed method can achieve nearly optimal collaborative spectrum sensing performance and high malicious user detection accuracy in the presence of arbitrary percentage of malicious users.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Distributed Ranking in Networks with Limited Memory and Communication</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study a basic information ranking problem in networks where each node holds an individual preference over a set of items and the goal for each node is to identify a sorted list of items with the largest aggregate preference. We would like to achieve this with a fully decentralized algorithm that uses a limited per-node memory and limited pair-wise communications. We show how this problem can be reduced to a plurality selection problem where the goal for each node is to identify an item with the largest aggregate ranking score, and show that solving the reduced problem solves the original ranking problem with high probability. Then we introduce a simple and natural plurality selection algorithm for the selection over $m &gt; 1$ items that uses only $\log_2(m)+1$ bits of per-node memory and per pair-wise communication. We prove correctness of the algorithm with high probability as the number of nodes grows large for the case when each node communicates with any other node, and establish tight convergence time bounds.&#13;
&#13;
The information ranking problem studied in this paper is a basic ranking problem that arises in various applications such as sorting elements in distributed computing systems, parallel databases, and may as well serve as a model of decentralized inference and opinion formation in distributed environments.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Degree-guided Map-Reduce Task Assignment with Data Locality Constraint</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The map-reduce framework is used in many data-intensive parallel processing systems. Data locality is an important problem with map-reduce as tasks with local data complete faster than those with remote data. We propose a degree-guided task assignment algorithm, which uses very little extra information than the currently implemented Random Server algorithm. We analyze a simple version of the degree-guided algorithm, called Peeling algorithm, and the Random Server algorithm in a discrete-time model using evolution of random graphs. We characterize the thresholds below which no queueing takes place and compute the effective service rates for these two algorithms. The degree-guided algorithm achieves the optimal performance in the region of practical interest and significantly outperforms the Random Server algorithm. The performance characteristics derived from discrete time model are confirmed with simulation in continuous time.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Trade-offs between Instantaneous and Total Capacity in Multi-Cell Flash Memories</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The limited endurance of flash memories is a major design concern for enterprise storage systems. We propose a method to increase it by using relative (as opposed to fixed) cell levels and by representing the information with Write Asymmetric Memory (WAM) codes. Overall, our new method enables faster writes, improved reliability as well as improved endurance by allowing multiple writes between block erasures. We study the capacity of the new WAM codes with relative levels, where the information is represented by multiset permutations induced by the charge levels, and show that it achieves the capacity of any other WAM codes with the same number of writes. Specifically, we prove that it has the potential to double the total capacity of the memory. Since capacity can be achieved only with cells that have a large number of levels, we propose a new architecture that consists of multi-cells - each an aggregation of a number of floating gate transistors.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimized Cell Programming for Flash Memories with Quantizers</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Multi-level flash memory cells represent data by the amount of charge stored in them. Certain voltages are applied to the flash memory cells to inject charges when programming and the cell level can be only increased during the programming process as a result of the high cost of block erasures. To achieve a high speed during writing, parallel programming is used, whereby a common voltage is applied to a group of cells to inject charges simultaneously. The voltage sharing simplifies the circuitry and increases the programming speed, but it also affects the precision of charge injection and limits the storage capacity of flash memory cells. Another factor that limits the precision of cell programming is the thermal electronics noise induced in charge injection.&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, we focus on noiseless parallel programming of multiple cells and noisy programming of a single cell. We propose a new criterion to evaluate the performance of the cell programming which is more suitable for flash memories in practice and then we optimize the parallel programming strategy accordingly. We then proceed to noisy programming and consider the two scenarios where feedback on cell levels is either available during programming or not. We study the optimization problem under both circumstances and present algorithms to achieve the optimal performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Tackling Intracell Variability in TLC Flash Through Tensor Product Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Flash memory is a promising new storage technology. To fully utilize future multi-level cell Flash memories, it is necessary to develop error correction coding schemes attuned to the underlying physical characteristics of Flash. Based on a careful inspection of fine-grained, experimentally-collected error patterns of TLC (three bits per cell) Flash, we propose a mathematical model that captures the intracell variability, which is manifested by certain patterns of bit-errors. New error correction codes are constructed for this model. For fixed levels of redundancy, these new codes are shown to exhibit substantially lower bit error rates than existing error correction schemes.</abstract>

        <abstract>Many storage channels admit reading and rewriting of the content at a given cost. We consider rewritable channels with uniform write noise and a hidden state which models the unknown characteristics of the memory cell. In addition to mitigating the effect of the write noise, rewrites can help the write controller obtain a better estimate of the hidden state. We present two coding strategies, each of which yields a lower bound on the rewrite capacity. We show that the second strategy is asymptotically optimal as the number of rewrites gets large.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Meeting the Levenshtein bound with equality by weighted-correlation complementary set</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Levenshtein improved the Welch bound on aperiodic correlation by weighting the cyclic shifts of the sequences over complex roots-of-unity. Although many works have been concerned on meeting the Welch bound with equality, no such effort has been reported for the Levenshtein bound. We show that the Levenshtein bound with equality is met if and only if the non-trivial aperiodic correlations have identical amplitude for all time-shifts, and the sequences form a novel class of complementary set whose aperiodic correlation is defined as the conventional aperiodic correlation modulated by a simplex weighting vector.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Cross-Correlation of Ternary m-Sequences of Period 3^{4k+2}-1 With Decimation {3^{4k+2}-3^{2k+1}+2}{4}+3^{2k+1}</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, for an integer $k$, we evaluate an upper bound for the cross-correlation of a ternary $m$-sequence of period $N = 3^{4k+2}-1$ and its decimated sequence with decimation $d = \frac{3^{4k+2}-3^{2k+1}+2}{4}+3^{2k+1}$. It is found that the cross-correlation is upper bounded by $4.5\cdot 3^{2k+1}+1$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Large Zero Periodic Autocorrelation Zone of Golay Sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Sequences with good correlation properties have been widely used in modern communications, radar and sonar applications. In this paper, we consider the autocorrelation property of the single binary and quaternary Golay sequences, with special focus on their zero periodic autocorrelation zone. Some examples along with one case of the proof will be given in order to demonstrate this zero periodic autocorrelation zone. This finding on Golay sequences can be explored during synchronization and detection at the receiver end and thus improve the performance of the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system where Golay sequences are employed for the peak-to-average power reduction.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Large Zero Odd Periodic Autocorrelation Zone of Golay Sequences and QAM Golay Sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Sequences with good correlation properties have been widely adopted in modern communications, radar and sonar applications. In this paper, we present that a single $H$-ary Golay sequence or $4^q$-QAM Golay sequence has a large zone of zero odd periodic autocorrelation, where $H\equiv 0\,(\bmod~4)$ is a positive integer and $q\ge 2$ is an arbitrary integer. The conditions on the permutations employed in the boolean functions are the same as those for the sequences with a large zone of zero (even) periodic autocorrelation. Those new results could be explored during synchronization and detection at the receiver end and thus improve the performance of the communication system.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Linear Information Coupling Problems</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Many network information theory problems face the similar difficulty of single letterization. We argue that this is due to the lack of a geometric structure on the space of probability distribution. In this paper, we develop such a structure by assuming that the distributions of interest are close to each other. Under this assumption, the K-L divergence is reduced to the squared Euclidean metric in an Euclidean space. Moreover, we construct the notion of coordinate and inner product, which will facilitate solving communication problems. We will also present the application of this approach to the point-to-point channel and the general broadcast channel, which demonstrates how our technique simplifies information theory problems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Cut-Set Bound for Generalized Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In a network, a node is said to incur a delay if its encoding of each transmitted symbol involves only its received symbols obtained before the time slot in which the transmitted symbol is sent (hence the transmitted symbol sent in a time slot cannot depend on the received symbol obtained in the same time slot). A node is said to incur no delay if its received symbol obtained in a time slot is available for encoding its transmitted symbol sent in the same time slot. In the classical discrete memoryless network (DMN), every node incurs a delay. A well-known result for the classical DMN is the cut-set outer bound. In this paper, we generalize the model of the DMN in such a way that some nodes may incur no delay, and we obtain the cut-set outer bound for the generalized DMN.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Cut-Set Bound for Generalized Networks with Positive Delay</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In a network, a node is said to incur a delay if its encoding of each transmitted symbol involves only its received symbols obtained before the time slot in which the transmitted symbol is sent (hence the transmitted symbol sent in a time slot cannot depend on the received symbol obtained in the same time slot). A node is said to incur no delay if its received symbol obtained in a time slot is available for encoding its transmitted symbol sent in the same time slot. In this paper, we investigate the generalized discrete memoryless network (DMN) where some nodes may incur no delay. We call the capacity region of the generalized DMN under the constraint that every node incurs a delay the positive-delay region. We establish the cut-set outer bound on the positive-delay region. In addition, we use our cut-set outer bound to show that in some two-node generalized DMN, the positive-delay region is strictly smaller than the capacity region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Achievability Proof via Output Statistics of Random Binning</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a new and ubiquitous framework for establishing achievability results in \emph{network information theory} (NIT) problems. The framework is used to prove various new results. To express the main tool, consider a set of discrete memoryless correlated sources (DMCS). Assume that each source (except one, $Z^n$) is randomly binned at a finite rate. We find sufficient conditions on these rates such that the bin indices are nearly mutually independent of each other and of $Z^n$. This is used in conjunction with the Slepian-Wolf (S-W) result to set up the framework. We begin by illustrating this method via examples from channel coding and rate-distortion (or covering problems). Next, we use the framework to prove a new result on the lossy transmission of a source over a broadcast channel. We also prove a new lower bound to a three receiver wiretap broadcast channel under a strong secrecy criterion. We observe that we can directly prove the strong notion of secrecy without resorting to the common techniques, e.g., the leftover hash lemma. We have also used our technique to solve the open problem of two-node interactive channel simulation and the problem of coordination via a relay.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Estimation of the Entropy on the Basis of its Polynomial Representation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An algorithm for estimating the entropy, which is based on the representation of the entropy function as the sum of two polynomial terms, called the polynomial approximation function and the remainder, is proposed. We construct an accurate and unbiased estimate of the value of the polynomial approximation function and use the known Bayesian approach to estimate the remainder. The combined estimator essentially reduces the bias of the constructed estimate as compared to the known estimators. Simulation results that confirm the claim are presented.</abstract>

        <papertitle>q-Gaussian based Smoothed Functional Algorithms for Stochastic Optimization</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The q-Gaussian distribution results from maximizing certain generalizations of Shannon entropy under some constraints. The importance of q-Gaussian distributions stems from the fact that they exhibit power-law behavior, and also generalize Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we propose a Smoothed Functional (SF) scheme for gradient estimation using q-Gaussian distribution, and also propose an algorithm for optimization based on the above scheme. Convergence results of the algorithm are presented. Performance of the proposed algorithm is shown by simulation results on a queuing model.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multi-Level Error-Resilient Neural Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of neural network association is to retrieve a previously memorized pattern from its noisy version using a network of neurons. An ideal neural network should include three components simultaneously: a learning algorithm, a large pattern retrieval capacity and resilience against noise. Prior works in this area usually improve one or two aspects at the cost of the third. &#13;
&#13;
Our work takes a step forward in closing this gap. More specifically, we show that by forcing natural constraints on the set of learning patterns, we can drastically improve the retrieval capacity of our neural network. Moreover, we devise a learning algorithm whose role is to learn those patterns satisfying the above mentioned constraints. Finally we show that our neural network can cope with a fair amount of noise.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Work recoverable from two-particle information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>It is shown how information contained in the pairwise correlations between atoms of a gas can be used to convert completely heat taken from a thermostat into mechanical work in a process of relaxation of the system to its thermal equilibrium state. Both classical correlations and quantum correlations (entanglement) are considered. The amount of heat converted into work is proportional to the entropy defect of the initial state of the system. The equivalence relation between information and work is explicitly demonstrated for the case of two-particle correlations. The amount of work obtained per particle is twice as large in the case of entanglement as in the case of classical correlations.</abstract>

        <abstract>Let $K = \{0,1,...,q-1\}$. We use a special class of translation invariant measures on $K^\mathbb{Z}$ called algebraic measures to study the entropy rate of a hidden Markov processes. We derive exact formulas for the entropy rate of a $q$ state hidden Markov process derived from a specific noise model and show that the formula converges exponentially fast to the entropy rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Minimax Strategy in Quantum Signal Detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The necessary and sufficient conditions for the minimax strategy of a finite number of decisions in quantum signal detection are derived in the case that the average Bayes cost is used as a quality function. This is a simple extension of the result of Hirota and Ikehara. Applying the necessary and sufficient conditions, a closed-form expression of the minimax strategy for binary pure state signal is shown. Furthermore, the minimax strategy for the discrimination problem of the quasi-Bell states is considered. In this case, the square-root measurement consisting of the quasi-Bell states yields the minimax strategy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Planar Difference Functions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In 1980 Alltop produced a family of cubic phase sequences that nearly meet the Welch bound for maximum non-peak correlation magnitude. This family of sequences were shown by Wooters and Fields to be useful for quantum state tomography. Alltop's construction used a function that is not planar, but whose difference function is planar. In this paper we show that Alltop type functions cannot exist in fields of characteristic 3 and that for a known class of planar functions, $x^3$ is the only Alltop type function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Results on the Fundamental Gain of Memory-Assisted Universal Source Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Many applications require data processing to be performed on individual pieces of data which are of finite sizes, e.g., files in cloud storage units and packets in data networks. However, traditional universal compression solutions would not perform well over the finite-length sequences. Recently, we proposed a framework called memory-assisted universal compression that holds a significant promise for reducing the amount of redundant data from the finite-length sequences. The proposed compression scheme is based on the observation that it is possible to learn source statistics (by memorizing previous sequences from the source) at some intermediate entities and then leverage the memorized context to reduce redundancy of the universal compression of finite-length sequences. We first present the fundamental gain of the proposed memory-assisted universal source coding over conventional universal compression (without memorization) for a single parametric source. Then, we extend and investigate the benefits of the memory-assisted universal source coding when the data sequences are generated by a compound source which is a mixture of parametric sources. We further develop a clustering technique within the memory-assisted compression framework to better utilize the memory by classifying the observed data sequences from a mixture of parametric sources. Finally, we demonstrate through computer simulations that the proposed joint memorization and clustering technique can achieve up to 6-fold improvement over the traditional universal compression technique when a mixture of non-binary Markov sources is considered.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Lossless variable-length source coding with unequal cost function is considered for general sources. In this problem, the codeword cost instead of codeword length is important. The infimum of average codeword cost has already been determined for general sources. We consider the overflow probability of codeword cost and determine the infimum of achievable overflow threshold. Our analysis is on the basis of information-spectrum methods and hence valid through the general source.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Bounds on estimated Markov orders of individual sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the maximal values estimated by commonly used Markov model order estimators on individual sequences. We start with penalized maximum likelihood (PML) estimators with cost functions of the form $-\log\Pemp_k(x^n) + f(n)\alpha^k$, where $\Pemp_k(x^n)$ is the ML probability of the input sequence $x^n$ under a Markov model of order $k$, $\alpha$ is the size of the input alphabet, and $f(n)$ is an increasing (penalization) function of $n$ (the popular BIC estimator corresponds to $f(n)=\frac{\alpha-1}{2}\log n$). Comparison with a memoryless model yields a known upper bound $\upper{k}{n}$ on the maximum order that $x^n$ can estimate. We show that, under mild conditions on $f$ that are satisfied by commonly used penalization functions, this simple bound is not far from tight, in the following sense: for sufficiently large $n$, and any $k{&lt;}\upper{k}{n}$, there are sequences $x^n$ that estimate order $k$; moreover, for all but a vanishing fraction of the values of $n$ such that $k=\upper{k}{n}$, there are sequences $x^n$ that estimate order $k$. We also study KT-based MDL Markov order estimators, and show that in this case, there are sequences $x^n$ that estimate order $n^{1/2-\epsilon}$, which is much larger than the maximum $\log n/\log\alpha(1+o(1))$ attainable by BIC, or the order $o(\log n)$ required for consistency of the KT estimator. In fact, for these sequences, limiting the allowed estimated order might incur in a significant asymptotic penalty in description length. All the results are constructive, and in each case we exhibit explicit sequences that attain the claimed estimated orders.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Variable-Length Extractors</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the problem of extracting a prescribed number of random bits by reading the smallest possible number of symbols from non-ideal stochastic processes. The related interval algorithm proposed by Han and Hoshi has asymptotically optimal performance; however, it assumes that the distribution of the input stochastic process is known. The motivation for our work is the fact that, in practice, sources of randomness have inherent correlations and are affected by measurement's noise. Namely, it is hard to obtain an accurate estimation of the distribution. This challenge was addressed by the concepts of seeded and seedless extractors that can handle general random sources with unknown distributions. However, known seeded and seedless extractors provide extraction efficiencies that are substantially smaller than Shannon's entropy limit. Our main contribution is the design of extractors that have a variable input-length and a fixed output length, are efficient in the consumption of symbols from the source, are capable of generating random bits from general stochastic processes and approach the information theoretic upper bound on efficiency.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Simple Schedules for Half-duplex Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the diamond network where a source communicates with the destination through N non-interfering half-duplex relays. Using simple outer bounds on the capacity of the network, we show that simple relaying strategies having exactly two states and avoiding broadcast and multiple access communication can still achieve a significant constant fraction of the capacity of the 2 relay network, independent of the SNR values. The results are extended to the case of 3 relays for the special class of antisymmetric networks. We also study the structure of (approximately) optimal relaying strategies for such networks. Simulations show that optimal schedules have at most N+1 states, which we conjecture to be true in general. We prove the conjecture for N=2 and in special cases for N=3.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Reducibility of joint relay positioning and flow optimization problem</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. This paper shows how to reduce the otherwise hard joint relay positioning and flow optimization problem into a sequence a two simpler decoupled problems. We consider a class of wireless multicast hypergraphs mainly characterized by their hyperarc rate functions, that are increasing and convex in power, and decreasing in distance between the transmit node and the farthest end node of the hyperarc. The set-up consists of a single multicast flow session involving a source, multiple destinations and a relay that can be positioned freely. The first problem formulates the relay positioning problem in a purely geometric sense, and once the optimal relay position is obtained the second problem addresses the flow optimization. Furthermore, we present simple and efficient algorithms to solve these problems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless MIMO Switching with MMSE Relaying</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A wireless relay which forms a one-to-one mapping from the inputs (uplinks) to the outputs (downlinks) is called a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) switch. The MIMO switch carries out {\em precode-and-forward}, where all users send their signals in the uplink and then the MIMO switch precodes the received vector signal for broadcasting in the downlink. Ideally, each user employs a receive filter to recover its desired signal from one other user with no or little interference from other users. We propose a joint design of the precoder and the receive filters to achieve the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE), assuming full channel state information is available at the relay. Our results indicate that the proposed MMSE relaying scheme outperforms the existing ZF/MMSE schemes and it has good worst-user throughput performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Spectral Efficiency Limits in Pilot-Assisted Cooperative Communications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Cooperation in a large wireless network with pilot-assisted coherent communication is shown to have certain fundamental limitations, namely that even perfect cooperation cannot in general change an interference-limited network to a noise-limited one. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of a spectral efficiency upper bound that does not grow with the transmit power, when channels are estimated via pilot signals. This is because pilot-assisted channel estimation is only possible within finite cooperation clusters, resulting in out-of-cluster interference that scales with the transmit power. Making the clusters excessively large can actually worsen this effect, nor does side-stepping the pilot-assisted channel estimation via noncoherent demodulation provide an escape. Using a cellular system as an example, it is demonstrated that the spectral efficiency saturates at power levels of operational relevance, indicating that the lackluster gains from cooperation observed in practice may be based on fundamental information-theoretic limitations, rather than current technology imperfections.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Pilot Contamination Precoding in Multi-Cell Large Scale Antenna Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An LSAS entails a large number (tens or hundreds) of base station antennas serving a much smaller number of terminals, with large gains in spectral-efficiency and energy-efficiency compared with conventional MIMO technology. Until recently it was believed that in multi-cellular LSAS, even in the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends to infinity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular interference. The interference results from unavoidable re-use of reverse-link pilot sequences (pilot contamination) by terminals in different cells.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We devise a new concept that leads to the effective elimination of inter-cell interference in TDD LSAS systems. This is achieved by outer multi-cellular pre-coding, which we call pilot contamination pre-coding (PCP). The main idea of PCP is that each base station linearly combines messages aimed to terminals from different cells that re-use the same pilot sequence. Crucially, the combining coefficients depend only on the {\em slow-fading coefficients} between the terminals and the base stations. Each base station independently transmits its PCP-combined symbols using conventional linear pre-coding that is based on estimated {\em fast-fading coefficients}. Further we derive estimates for SINRs and a capacity lower bound for the case of LSASs with PCP and finite number of antennas $M$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless Network Control with Privacy Using Hybrid ARQ</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of resource allocation in a wireless cellular network, in which nodes have both open and private information to be transmitted to the base station over block fading uplink channels. We develop a cross-layer solution, based on hybrid ARQ transmission with incremental redundancy. We provide a scheme that combines power control, flow control, and scheduling in order to maximize a global utility function, subject to the stability of the data queues, an average power constraint, and a constraint on the privacy outage probability. Our scheme is based on the assumption that each node has an estimate of its uplink channel gain at each time slot, while only the distribution of the cross channel gains is available. We prove that our scheme achieves a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility given the available channel state information.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Reverse Compute and Forward: A Low-Complexity Architecture for Downlink Distributed Antenna System</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a distributed antenna system where L antenna terminals (ATs) are connected to a Central Processor (CP) via digital error-free links of finite capacity R_0, and serve L user terminals (UTs). This system model has been widely investigated both for the uplink and the downlink, which are instances of the general multiple-access relay and broadcast relay networks. In this work we focus on the downlink, and propose a novel downlink precoding scheme nicknamed ``Reverse Quantized Compute and Forward'' (RQCoF). For this scheme we obtain achievable rates and compare with the state of the art available in the literature. We also provide simulation results for a realistic network with fading and pathloss with K &gt; L UTs, and show that channel-based user selection produces large benefits and essentially removes the problem of rank deficiency in the system matrix.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Base Station Cooperation with limited Feedback: A Large System Analysis</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In a multicell network, the quality of the channel state knowledge at the base stations (BSs) affects system performance. When this knowledge is acquired through a quantized feedback scheme, its quality is roughly determined by the number of feedback bits. In this paper we investigate feedback optimization problems for the quantized feedback scheme via random vector quantization (RVQ) in a two-cell MIMO broadcast channel. Assuming each user knows its direct and interfering channel states perfectly, we address the following question: given a total number of feedback bits, how should a user allocate those bits to quantize its direct and cross channel information? We pose that question for different levels of BS cooperation, namely Network MIMO and Coordinated Beamforming (CBf). We focus on regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding structures and derive our results in the large system limit where the number of users and antennas per BS tend to infinity with their ratio being fixed. We show that for both cooperation schemes, each user should allocate more bits to quantize the cross channel as the latter's gain ($\epsilon$) increases. We also show that, contrary to the full channel knowledge case, under this limited feedback scheme, for some values of $\epsilon$, no cooperation between the BSs is preferred.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Distributed computing with privacy</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A set of terminals that observe correlated data seek to compute functions of the data using interactive public communication. At the same time it is required that this communication observed by an eavesdropper, does not reveal the value of a private function of the data. In general, the private function and the functions computed by the nodes can be all different. We show that a class of functions are securely computable if and only if the conditional entropy of data given the value of private function is greater than the least rate of interactive communication required for an appropriately chosen multiterminal source coding task. A single-letter formula is provided for this rate in special cases.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Secure Computation in a Bidirectional Relay</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Bidirectional relaying, where a relay helps two user nodes to exchange equal length binary messages, has been an active area of recent research. A popular strategy involves a modified Gaussian MAC, where the relay decodes the XOR of the two messages using the naturally-occurring sum of symbols simultaneously transmitted by user nodes. In this work, we consider the Gaussian MAC in bidirectional relaying with an additional secrecy constraint for protection against a honest but curious relay. The constraint is that, while the relay should decode the XOR, it should be fully ignorant of the individual messages of the users. We exploit the symbol addition that occurs in a Gaussian MAC to design explicit strategies that achieve perfect independence between the received symbols and individual transmitted messages. Our results actually hold for a more general scenario where the messages at the two user nodes come from a finite Abelian group $G$, and the relay must decode the sum within $G$ of the two messages. We provide a lattice coding strategy and study optimal rate versus average power trade-offs for asymptotically large dimensions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Secrecy Capacity of 3-Receiver Broadcast Channel With Causal States and Conferencing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We investigate the secrecy capacity region of the 2-receiver, 1-eavesdropper Broadcast Channel (BC) with two causal states and conferencing decoders. The encoder sends two messages, one of them for both legitimate receivers and the other one for the first legitimate receiver. It keeps these messages secret from the eavesdropper. Each state is causally available at the corresponding receiver, while both states are known causally at the encoder. Each receiver wishes to send the state which is not available at the other receiver, through a noiseless link with limited capacity. We find an inner bound on the secrecy capacity region of this channel. The achievability scheme employs block Markov coding and Shannon strategy for channels with state. In each block, we make use of the states to generate two keys which will be used in the next block. The idea is to utilize the cooperation of both receivers to recover both keys at each receiver while ensuring secrecy. We also establish an outer bound on the secrecy capacity region of the 2-rec., 1-eav. BC with CCSI and conferencing. We prove that the proposed bounds coincide for a special case.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Secure Communication with Constrained Randomization</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we investigate how constraints on the randomization in the encoding process affect the secrecy rates achievable over wiretap channels. In particular, we characterize the secrecy capacity with a rate-limited local source of randomness and a less capable eavesdropper's channel, which shows that limited rate incurs a secrecy rate penalty but does not preclude secrecy. We also show that secure communication is possible when randomizing with a non-uniform source of randomness, which suggests the possibility of designing robust coding schemes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Secure Transmission of a Gaussian Source over Gaussian Channels with Side Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper investigates the problem of source- channel coding for secure transmission of a Gaussian source over a Gaussian wiretap channel in presence of arbitrarily correlated side informations at both receivers. By means of an appropriate coding scheme (either hybrid digital/analog or pure digital), the optimal rate-distortion-equivocation region is characterized for most of the scenarios. These results provide the best achievable tradeoff between the requirement on the distortion level at the legitimate receiver and the equivocation rate at the eavesdropper.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Long MDS Codes for Optimal Repair Bandwidth</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>MDS codes are erasure-correcting codes that can correct the maximum number of erasures given the number of redundancy or parity symbols. If an MDS code has r parities and no more than r erasures occur, then by transmitting all the remaining data in the code one can recover the original information. However, it was shown that in order to recover a single symbol erasure, only a fraction of 1/r of the information needs to be transmitted. This fraction is called the repair bandwidth (fraction). Explicit code constructions were given in previous works. If we view each symbol in the code as a vector or a column, then the code forms a 2D array and such codes are especially widely used in storage systems. In this paper, we ask the following question: given the length of the column l, can we construct high-rate MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth of 1/r, whose code length is as long as possible? In this paper, we give code constructions such that the code length is (r+1)\log_r l.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Access vs. Bandwidth in Codes for Storage</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are widely used in storage systems to protect against disks (nodes) failures. An (n,k,l) MDS code uses n nodes of capacity l to store k information nodes. The MDS property guarantees the resiliency to any n-k node failures. An optimal bandwidth (resp. optimal access) MDS code communicates (resp. accesses) the minimum amount of data during the recovery process of a single failed node. It was shown that this amount equals a fraction of 1/(n-k) of data stored in each node. In previous optimal bandwidth constructions, l scaled polynomially with k in codes with asymptotic rate &lt;1. Moreover, in constructions with constant number of parities, i.e. rate approaches 1, l scaled exponentially w.r.t. k. In this paper we focus on the practical case of n-k=2, and ask the following question: Given the capacity of a node l what is the largest (w.r.t. k) optimal bandwidth (resp. access) (k+2,k,l) MDS code. We give an upper bound for the general case, and two tight bounds in the special cases of two important families of codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Functional-Repair-by-Transfer Regenerating Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In a distributed storage system, a data file is distributed to several storage nodes, such that the original file can be decoded from any subset of the storage nodes of size larger than or equal to a certain threshold. Upon the failure of a storage node, we would like to regenerate it with minimal amount of data transmissions from the surviving nodes to the new node. This performance metric is called the repair-bandwidth. Another performance metric is the disk input/output (I/O) cost, which measures the number of bits a storage node needs to read out from its memory in order to repair the failed node. In this paper, we give examples of linear regenerating codes with minimal disk I/O cost and repair-bandwidth, without any linear mixing in the helping storage nodes.</abstract>

        <abstract>We study the exact and optimal repair of multiple failures in codes for distributed storage. More particularly, we examine the use of interference alignment to build exact scalar minimum storage coordinated regenerating codes (MSCR). We show that it is possible to build codes for the case of k = 2 and d &gt; k by aligning interferences independently but that this technique cannot be applied as soon as k &gt; 2 and d &gt; k. Our results also apply to adaptive regenerating codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Regenerating Codes for Errors and Erasures in Distributed Storage</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Regenerating codes are a class of codes proposed for providing reliability of data and efficient repair of failed nodes in distributed storage systems. In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of handling errors and erasures during the data-reconstruction and node-repair operations. We provide explicit regenerating codes that are resilient to errors and erasures, and show that these codes are optimal with respect to storage and bandwidth requirements. As a special case, we also establish the capacity of a class of distributed storage systems in the presence of malicious adversaries. While our code constructions are based on previously constructed Product-Matrix codes, we also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for introducing resilience in any regenerating code.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On inverses of APN exponents</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this extended abstract we present results on the inverses modulo 2^n-1 of the known APN exponents. In particular, we describe explicitly the inverses of the Welch and Dobbertin exponents and give the main ideas of their proofs. Further, we observe that the inverse of the Dobbertin exponent defines an APN function on GF(2^n) of algebraic degree (n+3)/2, which is the first example of such a function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Generalized Bent Functions and Their Relation to Maiorana-McFarland Class</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, most of the known infinite classes of generalized bent functions are analyzed for their relation to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class. This is done using the criterion based on second-order derivatives of a function. In particular, it is shown that, unlike in the binary case, not all quadratic bent functions are EA-equivalent to a function of the Maiorana-McFarland type. This is the first attempt to rise this problem for the generalized bent functions.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Let $m$ be odd and $q=2^{2m}$. Let $5r\equiv 1\pmod{2^m+1}$ and $d=(2^m-1)r+1$. In this paper, the cross correlation distributions of an $m$-sequence $s$ with period $q-1$ and its decimated sequences $s(dt+l)$ with period $(q-1)/3$ for $0\leq l\leq 2$ are determined. These cross correlations are shown to be four-valued with maximal magnitude $2 \sqrt{q}-1$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rotating-table game and construction of periodic sequences with lightweight calculation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A well-known operator of vectors over finite field is the derivative, which is used to investigate the complexity of vectors in game theory, communication theory and cryptography. According to the operator, a corresponding complexity of the vector is called (the first) depth, which also contributes to another two definitions (the second and the third depths) by using polynomial factor and high order difference, respectively. For an n-dimensional vector over F_q (a finite field with q elements and characteristic p), the three depths are the same as its linear complexity if n=p^r (r&gt;0).&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, by investigation on vectors s of length n (or equivalent sequences of period n) with infinite third depth, and the cyclic-left-shift-difference operator E-1 on s, long least ultimate period sequences {(E-1)^i(s)}_{i&gt;=0} are constructed with high probability over big alphabet using lightweight calculation. Furthermore, distributions of sequences s with period n=p^r-1 (r&gt;0), are described in terms of the least ultimate periods of {(E-1)^i(s)}_{i&gt;=0}.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, we depict circulant matrix structure of the operator (E-1)^i and determine its rank. Some upper bounds on the ultimate period of {(E-1)^i(s)}_{i&gt;=0} and a method to determine the least ultimate period are provided. The least ultimate period presents an adversary a sufficient condition to win the rotating-table game with rapid counteraction (RGRC).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Low Probability of Intercept Properties of Some Binary Sequence Families with Good Correlation Properties</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The design of pseudorandom sequences with optimal correlation properties forms a crucial part of communications and radar engineering. With the increasingly crowded electromagnetic spectrum, interference between different systems is becoming more important. In this paper, we consider the Low Probability of Intercept properties of some commonly used sequence families, with respect to their triple correlation function. The binary families we consider include the Gold sequence family, the Gold-like sequence family with quadratic span, and the Bent Function sequence family.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Information-Theoretically Optimal Compressed Sensing via Spatial Coupling and Approximate Message Passing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We study the compressed sensing reconstruction problem for a broad class of random, band-diagonal sensing matrices. This construction is inspired by the idea of spatial coupling in coding theory. As demonstrated heuristically and numerically by Krzakala et al. \cite{KrzakalaEtAl}, message passing algorithms can effectively solve the reconstruction problem for spatially coupled measurements with undersampling rates close to the fraction of non-zero coordinates. &#13;
&#13;
We use an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and analyze it through the state evolution method. We give a rigorous proof that this approach is successful as soon as the undersampling rate $\delta$ exceeds the (upper) R\'enyi information dimension of the signal, $\uRenyi(p_X)$. More precisely, for a sequence of signals of diverging dimension $n$ whose empirical distribution converges to $p_X$, reconstruction is with high probability successful from $\uRenyi(p_X)\, n+o(n)$ measurements taken according to a band diagonal matrix.&#13;
&#13;
For sparse signals, i.e. sequences of dimension $n$ and $k(n)$ non-zero entries, this implies reconstruction from $k(n)+o(n)$ measurements. For `discrete' signals, i.e. signals whose coordinates take a fixed finite set of values, this implies reconstruction from $o(n)$ measurements. The result is robust with respect to noise, does not apply uniquely to random signals, but requires the knowledge of the empirical distribution of the signal $p_X$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Hybrid Generalized Approximate Message Passing with Applications to Structured Sparsity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Gaussian and quadratic approximations of message passing algorithms on graphs have attracted considerable attention due to their computational simplicity, analytic tractability, and wide applicability in optimization and statistical inference problems. This paper summarizes a systematic framework for incorporating such approximate message passing (AMP) methods in general graphical models. The key concept is a partition of dependencies of a general graphical model into strong and weak edges, with each weak edge representing a small, linearizable coupling of variables. AMP approximations based on the central limit theorem can be applied to the weak edges and integrated with standard message passing updates on the strong edges. The resulting algorithm, which we call hybrid generalized approximate message passing (Hybrid-GAMP), can yield significantly simpler implementations of sum-product and max-sum loopy belief propagation. By varying the partition between strong and weak edges, a performance-complexity trade-off can be achieved. Structured sparsity problems are studied as an example of this general methodology where there is a natural partition of edges.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Quantized Stochastic Belief Propagation: Efficient Message-Passing for Continuous State Spaces</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Belief propagation (BP) is a widely used algorithm for computing the marginal distributions in graphical models. However, in applications involving continuous random variables, the messages themselves are real-valued functions, which leads to significant computational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a low complexity method for performing belief propagation for continuous state space problems. Our algorithm, which we refer to as quantized stochastic belief propagation (QSBP), is a randomized variant of BP in which each node only passes stochastically chosen information at each round. The most attractive feature of QSBP is its significant gain in computational and communication efficiencies. In addition, we provide some theoretical guarantees including almost sure convergence and the rate of convergence for the case of tree-structured graphical models.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Iterative Estimation of Constrained Rank-One Matrices in Noise</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of estimating a rank-one matrix in Gaussian noise under a probabilistic model for left and right factors of the matrix. The probabilistic model can impose constraints on the factors including sparsity and positivity, which arise commonly in learning problems. Optimal estimation of such constrained low-rank matrices is hard. A simple iterative procedure that reduces the problem to a sequence of scalar estimation computations is proposed. The method is similar in form to approximate message passing methods based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation. Leveraging analysis methods by Bayati and Montanari, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the estimates is described by a simple equivalent model, where the behavior of the estimates is identical to scalar estimates in Gaussian noise. Moreover, the effective Gaussian noise level is described by a set of state evolution equations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Entropy functions and determinant inequalities</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we show that the characterisation of all determinant inequalities for $n \times n$ positive definite matrices is equivalent to determining the smallest closed and convex cone containing all entropy functions induced by $n$ scalar Gaussian random variables. We have obtained inner and outer bounds on the cone by using representable functions and entropic functions. In particular, these bounds are tight and explicit for $n \le 3$, implying that determinant inequalities for $3 \times 3$ positive definite matrices are completely characterized by Shannon-type information inequalities.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper investigates a new method in proving converses in secure communication problems. The method gives a converse result in terms of the logarithm of support size instead of entropy. The results are connected to constrained information inequalities involving three random variables. A new constrained non-Shannon type inequality is shown.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Sumset Inequalities for Differential Entropy and Mutual Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The Plunnecke-Ruzsa sumset theory gives bounds connecting the cardinality of the sumset A+B defined as {a+b ; a\in A, b\in B} with the cardinalities of the original sets A,B. For example, the sum-difference bound states that, |A+B||A||B|\leq |A-B|^3, where A-B={a-b ; a\in A, b\in B}. Interpreting the differential entropy h(X) as (the logarithm of) the size of the effective support of X, the main results here are a series of natural information-theoretic analogs for these bounds. For example, the sum-difference bound becomes the new inequality, h(X+Y)+h(X)+h(Y)\leq3h(X-Y), for independent X,Y. Our results include differential-entropy versions of Ruzsa's triangle inequality, the Plunnecke-Ruzsa inequality, and the Balog-Szemeredi-Gowers lemma. Versions of most of these results for the discrete entropy H(X) were recently proved by Tao, relying heavily on a strong, functional form of the submodularity property of H(X). Since differential entropy is not functionally submodular, in the continuous case many of the corresponding discrete proofs fail, in several cases requiring substantially new proof strategies. The basic property that naturally replaces functional submodularity is the data processing property of mutual information.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Information Theoretic Perspective Over an Extremal Entropy Inequality</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper focuses on developing an alternative proof for an extremal entropy inequality, originally presented by Liu and Viswanath. The proposed alternative proof is simply based on the classical entropy power inequality and the data processing inequality. Compared with the proofs proposed by Liu and Viswanath, the proposed alternative proof is simpler, more direct, and information theoretic, and presents the advantage of providing the structure of the optimal solution covariance matrix. Also, the proposed proof might also be used as a novel method to address applications such as calculation of the vector Gaussian broadcast channel capacity, establishing a lower bound for the achievable rate of distributed source coding with a single quadratic distortion constraint, and the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wire-tap channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Data Processing Inequalities Based on a Certain Structured Class of Information Measures with Application to Estimation Theory</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study data processing inequalities (DPI's) that are derived from a certain class of generalized information measures, where a series of convex functions and multiplicative likelihood ratios are nested alternately. A certain choice of the convex functions leads to an information measure that extends the notion of the Bhattacharyya distance: While the ordinary Bhattacharyya distance is based on the geometric mean of two replicas of the channel's conditional distribution, the more general one allows an arbitrary number of replicas. We apply the DPI induced by this information measure to a detailed study of lower bounds of parameter estimation under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and show that in certain cases, tighter bounds can be obtained by using more than two replicas. While the resulting bound may not compete favorably with the best bounds available for the ordinary AWGN channel, the advantage of the new lower bound, becomes significant in the presence of channel uncertainty, like unknown fading. This is explained by the convexity property of the information measure.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Compressive Principal Component Pursuit</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of recovering a target matrix that is a superposition of low-rank and sparse components, from a small set of linear measurements. This problem arises in compressed sensing of structured high-dimensional signals such as videos and hyperspectral images, as well as in the analysis of transformation invariant low-rank recovery. We analyze the performance of the natural convex heuristic for solving this problem, under the assumption that measurements are chosen uniformly at random. We prove that this heuristic exactly recovers low-rank and sparse terms, provided the number of observations exceeds the number of intrinsic degrees of freedom of the component signals by a polylogarithmic factor. Our analysis introduces several ideas that may be of independent interest for the more general problem of compressive sensing of superpositions of structured signals.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Principal Component Pursuit with Reduced Linear Measurements</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we study the problem of decomposing a superposition of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix when a relatively few linear measurements are available. This problem arises in many data processing tasks such as aligning multiple images or rectifying regular texture, where the goal is to recover a low-rank matrix with a large fraction of corrupted entries in the presence of nonlinear domain transformation. We consider a natural convex heuristic to this problem which is a variant to the recently proposed Principal Component Pursuit. We prove that under suitable conditions, this convex program guarantees to recover the correct low-rank and sparse components despite reduced measurements. Our analysis covers both random and deterministic measurement models.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Bilateral Random Projections</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Low-rank structure have been profoundly studied in data mining and machine learning. In this paper, we show a dense matrix $X$'s low-rank approximation can be rapidly built from its left and right random projections $Y_1=XA_1$ and $Y_2=X^TA_2$, or bilateral random projection (BRP). We then show power scheme can further improve the precision. The deterministic, average and deviation bounds of the proposed method and its power scheme modification are proved theoretically. The effectiveness and the efficiency of BRP based low-rank approximation is empirically verified on both artificial and real datasets.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Compressed Sensing on the Image of Bilinear Maps</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>For several communication models, the dispersive part of a communication channel is described by a bilinear operation $T$ between the possible sets of input signals and channel parameters. The received channel output has then to be identified from the image $T(X,Y)$ of the input signal difference sets $X$ and the channel state sets $Y$. The main goal in this contribution is to characterize the compressibility of $T(X,Y)$ with respect to an ambient dimension $N$. In this paper we show that a restricted norm multiplicativity of $T$ on all canonical subspaces $X$ and $Y$ with dimension $S$ resp. $F$ is sufficient for the reconstruction of output signals with an overwhelming probability from $\mathcal{O}((S+F)\log N)$ random sub-Gaussian measurements. Thus, in this case, the number of degrees of freedom of each output grows only additively instead of multiplicatively with the input dimensions (sparsity) $S$ and $F$. This is a relevant improvement in the output compressibility and suggests a substantially reduced rate in compressed sampling algorithms.</abstract>

        <papertitle>SPIN: Iterative Signal Recovery on Incoherent Manifolds</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Suppose that we observe noisy linear measurements of an unknown signal that can be modeled as the sum of two component signals, each of which arises from a nonlinear sub-manifold of a high-dimensional ambient space. We introduce Successive Projection onto INcoherent manifolds (SPIN), a first-order projected gradient method to recover the signal components. Despite the nonconvex nature of the recovery problem and the possibility of underdetermined measurements, SPIN provably recovers the signal components, provided that the signal manifolds are incoherent and that the measurement operator satisfies a certain restricted isometry property. SPIN significantly extends the scope of current signal recovery models and algorithms for low-dimensional linear inverse problems, and matches (or exceeds) the current state of the art in terms of performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On a construction of universal network code using LDPC matrices</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An LDPC matrix is used as a local encoding kernel at each link to construct a universal code to address network coding problems. It is also shown that at each terminal node the global encoding kernel that constructs a decoder becomes an LDPC matrix. This provides the perspective that decoding complexity can be reduced to a linear order of a block length by using an efficient decoding algorithm such as the sum-product algorithm.</abstract>

        <abstract>It is well known that transfer polynomials play an important role in the network code design problem. In this paper we provide a graph theoretical description of the terms of such polynomials. We consider acyclic networks with arbitrary number of receivers and min-cut $h$ between each source-receiver pair. We show that the associated polynomial can be described in terms of certain subgraphs of the network.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Network Coding Aware Resource Allocation to Improve Throughput</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the area of network coding in terms of theory, code design, and applications. However, from a cross-layer perspective, the understanding of resource allocation for random network coding (RNC) and its impact on network throughput has been limited. In this article we address the problem of resource allocation for RNC in a general wireless network, using the recent framework that models the dynamics of RNC using a system of differential equations. Based on this framework, we design a gradient algorithm that can be used to improve a variety of throughput objectives.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Min-Cost Multicast Networks in Euclidean Space</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Space information flow is a new field of research recently proposed by Li and Wu. It studies the transmission of information in a geometric space, where information flows can be routed along any trajectories, and can be encoded wherever they meet. The goal is to satisfy given end-to-end unicast/multicast throughput demands, while minimizing a natural bandwidth-distance sum-product (network volume). Space information flow models the design of a blueprint for a minimum-cost network. We study the multicast version of the space information flow problem, in Euclidean spaces. We present a simple example that demonstrates the design of an information network is indeed different from that of a transportation network. We discuss properties of optimal multicast network embedding, prove that network coding does not make a difference in the basic case of 1-to-2 multicast, and prove upper-bounds on the number of relay nodes required in an optimal multicast network in general.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Selective Coding Strategy for Unicast Composite Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider a composite unicast relay network where the channel statistic is randomly drawn from a set of conditional distributions indexed by $\theta\in\Theta$, which is assumed to be unknown at the source, fully known at the destination and only partly known at the relays. Commonly, the coding strategy at each relay is fixed regardless of its channel measurement. A novel coding for unicast composite networks with multiple relays is introduced. This enables the relays to select dynamically --based on its channel measurement-- the best coding scheme between compress-and-forward (CF) and decode-and-forward (DF). As a part of the main result, a generalization of Noisy Network Coding is shown for the case of unicast general networks where the relays are divided between those using DF and CF coding. Furthermore, the relays using DF scheme can exploit the help of those based on CF scheme via offset coding. It is demonstrated via numerical results that this novel coding, referred to as Selective Coding Strategy (SCS), outperforms conventional coding schemes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Causal relay networks with causal side information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we consider causal discrete-memoryless relay networks (DMRNs) with causal side information. The networks consist of multiple nodes, each of which can be a source, relay, and/or destination. There are two types of relays in the network, i.e., relays with one sample delay (classical relays) and relays without delay (causal relays) whose transmit signal depends not only on the past received symbols but also on the current received symbol. Also, we assume that some nodes can causally use channel state information (CSI) as side information. For the network, we derive a new cut-set bound, which recovers classical cut-set bound and our previous cut-set bound for causal DMRNs without side information. Using an example of a fading relay channel, we show that the new cut-set bound can be achieved by a simple amplify-and-forward type relaying.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Partial Decode-Forward Binning for Full-Duplex Causal Cognitive Interference Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The causal cognitive interference channel (CCIC) is a four-node channel, in which the second sender obtains information from the first sender causally and assists in the transmission of both. We propose a new coding scheme called Han-Kobayashi partial decode-forward binning (HK-PDF-binning), which combines the ideas of Han-Kobayashi coding, partial decode-forward relaying, conditional Gelfand-Pinsker binning and relaxed joint decoding. The second sender decodes a part of the message from the first sender, then uses Gelfand-Pinsker binning to bin against the decoded codeword. When applied to the Gaussian channel, this HK-PDF-binning essentializes to a correlation between the transmit signal and the state, which encompasses the traditional dirty-paper-coding binning as a special case when this correlation factor is zero. The proposed scheme encompasses the Han-Kobayashi rate region and achieves both partial decode-forward relaying rate for the first user and interference-free rate for the second user.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Combined Decode-Forward and Layered Noisy Network Coding Schemes for Relay Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We propose two coding schemes combining decode-forward (DF) and noisy network coding (NNC) with different flavors. The first is a combined DF-NNC scheme for the one-way relay channel which includes both DF and NNC as special cases by performing rate splitting, partial block Markov encoding and NNC. The second combines two different DF strategies and layered NNC for the two-way relay channel. One DF strategy performs coherent block Markov encoding at the source at the cost of power splitting at the relay, the other performs independent source and relay encoding but with full relay power, and layered NNC allows a different compression rate for each destination. Analysis and simulation show that both proposed schemes supersede each individual scheme and take full advantage of both DF and NNC.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy-Efficient Sensing and Communication of Parallel Gaussian Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Energy efficiency is a key requirement in the design of wireless sensor networks. While most theoretical studies only account for the energy requirements of communication, the sensing process, which includes measurements and compression, can also consume comparable energy. In this paper, the problem of sensing and communicating parallel sources is studied by accounting for the cost of both communication and sensing. In the first formulation of the problem, the sensor has a separate energy budget for sensing and a rate budget for communication, while, in the second, it has a single energy budget for both tasks. Assuming that sources with larger variances have lower sensing costs, the optimal allocation of sensing energy and rate that minimizes the overall distortion is derived for the first problem. Moreover, structural results on the solution of the second problem are derived under the assumption that the sources with larger variances are transmitted on channels with lower noise.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Achievable Rates for Intermittent Communication</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We formulate a model for intermittent communications that can capture bursty transmissions or a sporadically available channel, where in either case the receiver does not know a priori when the transmissions occur. Focusing on the point-to-point case, we develop two decoding schemes and their achievable rates for such communication scenarios. One scheme determines the transmitted codeword, and another scheme first locates the information symbols and then uses them to decode. The two-stage scheme leads to a higher achievable rate because it uses a generalization of the method of types in the first stage, which leads to a notion of partial divergence. We illustrate the results in the case of an intermittent binary symmetric channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Energy State Amplification in an Energy Harvesting Communication System</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. In energy harvesting communication systems, the energy required for information transmission is maintained by an exogenous energy arrival process independent of the message. This links the problem of communication with an energy harvesting transmitter to the problem of communication over state-dependent channels. In particular, if the transmitter has no battery, the resulting channel is a state dependent channel with causal state information at the transmitter, where the state is the available energy at any given channel use. In general, information transmission blurs the state information that the receiver can get from the received signal. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between the information rate R and the entropy reduction of the energy arrival process Delta at the receiver side over an AWGN channel with an energy harvesting transmitter. If the transmitter has no battery, the trade-off points are achieved by Shannon strategies and we show that the optimal input distributions are discrete. Next, we consider the state amplification problem for an energy harvesting transmitter with an unlimited battery. We show that the boundary of the optimal trade-off region in this extreme case is a line and it is achieved by a combination of best-effort-transmit and random binning schemes with an i.i.d. Gaussian codebook of average power equal to the average recharge rate. We propose a practical uncoded state amplification scheme that splits the available energy between message transmission and entropy reduction and study its performance in a numerical example.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Energy/Information Cross-Layer Architectures</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The importance of architectural principles in the design of engineering systems is well-recognized. This paper argues that the traditional separation between energy delivery and information delivery leads to suboptimal systems. To demonstrate this for wireline systems that may use DC powerline communication, a capacity-power-wiring cost function is defined. Signaling strategies that optimize this function deliver patterned energy: a commodity measured in bits and joules such that energy and information are intermixed. Cross-layer design leads to improved performance.</abstract>

Specifically, we study the case of a single encoder and two decoders, where the encoder provides a common description to both the decoders and a private description to only one of the decoders. The decoders cooperate via cribbing, i.e., the decoder with access only to the common description is allowed to observe, in addition, a deterministic function of the reconstruction symbols produced by the other. We characterize the fundamental performance limits in the respective settings of non-causal, strictly-causal and causal cribbing. We use a new coding scheme, referred to as Forward Encoding and Block Markov Decoding, which is a variant of one recently used by Cuff and Zhao for coordination via implicit communication. Finally, we use the insight gained to introduce and solve some dual channel coding scenarios involving Multiple Access Channels with cribbing.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Combinatorial Message Sharing and Random Binning for Multiple Description Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper proposes a new multiple description (MD) coding method and an associated achievable rate-distortion region for $L\geq 2$ channels. The proposed scheme randomly bins codebooks chosen from the codebook structure, similar to that of the recently proposed combinatorial message sharing (CMS) scheme designed for conditional codebook encoding. The proposed scheme effectively performs multilayer random binning for each subset of the description, which hence enables to utilize the symmetry of a &quot;subset&quot; of the description rates wherever it exists. The new scheme specializes in to the conventional multilayer random binning as an extreme special case.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Gaussian Multiple Descriptions with Common and Constrained Reconstruction Constraints</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of multiple descriptions for a Gaussian source is considered, in which all the decoders have access to correlated Gaussian side-information. Two variations of this problem are studied. First, the rate-distortion tradeoff is characterized under the assumption of a common reconstruction constraint, in which the estimate produced at each of the decoders is also exactly recoverable at the encoder. Secondly, a generalization of this setup is studied in which possibly different distortions are tolerable between the estimates at the encoder and the respective estimates at each of the decoders.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Making WOM Codes Decodable using Short Synchronous WOM Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>While some write once memory (WOM) codes are inherently decodable, others require the added knowledge of the current generation in order to successfully decode the state of the memory. If there is no limit on the code length, n, a binary non-decodable t-write WOM code can be made decodable at an insignificant cost in terms of code rate by adding t-1 cells to store the current generation after replicating the code enough times for the t-1 cells to be of negligible weight. This justifies the research on non-decodable WOM codes. However, if n is bounded, the t-1 additional cells may introduce a significant loss in terms of code rate. In this paper, we propose a new method to make non-decodable WOM codes decodable at a lower price when n is bounded. The main idea is to add cells that do not only store the current generation, but also additional data, by using a synchronous (t-1)-write WOM code of length t-1 or slightly above which does not contain the all-zero codeword. A bound on the rate of a simple family of synchronous WOM codes with n = t is given, as well as very short codes from this family. Better codes are then obtained by local manipulations of these codes. Finally, a construction of synchronous WOM codes with good properties is proposed to reach higher values of t.</abstract>

        <papertitle>High Sum-Rate Three-Write and Non-Binary WOM Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Write-once memory (WOM) is a storage medium with memory elements, called cells, which can take on q levels. Each cell is initially in level 0 and can only increase its level. A t-write WOM code is a coding scheme which allows one to store t messages to the WOM such that on consecutive writes every cell's level does not decrease. The sum-rate of the WOM-code, which is the ratio between the total amount of information written in the t writes and the number of memory cells, is bounded by log_2(t+1).&#13;
&#13;
Our main contribution in this work is a construction of binary three-write WOM codes with sum-rate 1.885, while the upper bound is 2. This improves upon a recent construction of sum-rate 1.809. We also give constructions of non-binary WOM codes which give better sum-rate than the currently best known ones.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Short Q-ary WOM Codes with Hot/Cold Write Differentiation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We construct new WOM codes with practical design considerations. First the problem of 2 cell q-ary WOM codes is addressed with a construction that uses lattice tilings. The resulting codes for arbitrary numbers of input bits are shown to be within a small additive constant from the capacity. Then we introduce a new model of WOM codes that support data bits with different update requirements. Differentiation between frequently written (hot) bits and rarely written (cold) ones allows a large number of re-writes while leveling the wear between the hot and cold input bits.</abstract>

        <papertitle>WOM with Retained Messages</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Write-once memory (WOM) is a binary storage medium in which each memory cell is initially in state 0 and can be irreversibly programmed to state 1. This paper studies the problem of writing multiple messages into a WOM. Instead of writing a new message (and obliterating old ones) as in the traditional setup of WOM, the reader wishes to retain access to previously written messages. The capacity region is studied and code constructions are proposed for three canonical problems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Transmission of non-linear binary input functions over a CDMA System</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the problem of transmission of binary input non-linear functions over a network of mobiles based on CDMA. Motivation for this study comes from the application of using cheap measurement devices installed on personal cell-phones to monitor environmental parameters such as air pollution, temperature and noise level. Our model resembles the MAC model of Nazer and Gastpar except that the encoders are restricted to be CDMA encoders. Unlike the work of Nazer and Gastpar whose main attention is transmission of linear functions, we deal with non-linear functions with binary inputs. A main contribution of this paper is a lower bound on the computational capacity for this problem. While in the traditional CDMA system the signature matrix of the CDMA system preferably has independent rows, here the signature matrix of the CDMA system is viewed as the parity check matrix of a linear code, reflecting our treatment of the interference. We also introduce the problem of Slepian-Wolf compression with the same compression matrix.</abstract>

        <papertitle>New Near-optimal Codebooks Associated With Binary Sidelnikov Sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper,an $(N, K)$ codebook is constructed from a $K \times N$ partial matrix with $K &lt; N$, where each code vector is equivalent to a column of the matrix. To obtain the $K \times N$ matrix, $K$ rows are selected from a $J \times N$ matrix $\Phibu$, associated with a binary sequence of length $J$ and Hamming weight $K$, where a set of the selected row indices is the index set of nonzero entries of the binary sequence. It is then discovered that the maximum magnitude of inner products between a pair of distinct code vectors is determined by the maximum magnitude of the $\Phibu$-transform of the binary sequence. Thus, constructing a codebook with small magnitude of inner products is equivalent to finding a binary sequence where the maximum magnitude of its $\Phibu$-transform is as small as possible. From the discovery, new classes of near-optimal codebooks with nontrivial bounds on the maximum inner products are constructed from Fourier and Hadamard matrices associated with binary Sidelnikov sequences.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, for an odd prime $p$ and positive integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ such that $n=(2m+1)k$, two families of $p$-ary sequences of period $p^n-1$ with low correlation and large linear complexity were constructed using decimated Helleseth-Gong sequences and $m$-sequence. It is shown that the proposed families have five-level nontrivial correlation property with maximum correlation $1+p^{\frac{n+3k}{2}}$, family size $p^n+1$ and maximal linear span $n(m+1)$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>New Constructions of Asymptotically Optimal Optical Orthogonal Codes With lambda=1</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are widely used as spreading codes in optical fiber networks. For reliable and efficient data transmission in these systems, it is required to design OOCs with low correlation and large size. In this paper, we present two new constructions for asymptotically optimal OOCs with respect to the Johnson bound, whose maximum nontrivial correlation value is $1$. We first construct an asymptotically optimal OOC of length $(p-1)p^2$ for an odd prime $p$ by using the structure of the ring of integers modulo $p^2$. We then present an asymptotically optimal OOC of length $Mp_1p_2$ from a product of two finite fields, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are odd primes, and $M$ is an integer such that $M|\,p_i-1$ for $i=1,2$.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This work describes an $M^2\times M$ Zak space construction of new zero correlation zone polyphase sequence sets with all-zero cross-correlation. The construction includes the sets with $(M-1)$-point, $(T_2M-1)$-point and $(M^2-1)$-point zero auto correlation zone, where $T_2$ is an arbitrary non-trivial factor of $M$. All sequences in these sets have discrete Fourier transforms with constant magnitude at $M^2$ points and zero otherwise.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Complete Monotonicity of Symbol Error Rates</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; In this paper, we show that under maximum likelihood detection, the symbol error rate of an arbitrary multi-dimensional constellation impaired by independent and identically distributed additive white Gaussian noise is completely monotonic in the average SNR, if the rank of the constellation matrix is either one or two. Further, under minimum distance detection, we show that this result generalizes to the case when the noise follows a correlated and identically distributed compound Gaussian distribution. Our complete monotonicity results are stronger than the corresponding convexity results for one or two dimensional constellations established in the literature. We also identify classes of constellations with dimensionality greater than two, which have completely monotone and convex error rates. Through the complete monotonicity of the symbol error rate, we obtain generic comparisons of average error rates of such constellations over parametric fading channels using the tools of stochastic ordering, even in cases where the exact expression for the error rate is intractable.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Serial Concatenation of Coding and Trellis Shaping for OFDM Systems with Peak Power Reduction</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) can achieve remarkable performance in terms of spectral efficiency. However, its well-known drawback is that the OFDM signals have high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and this causes performance degradation in terms of power amplifier (PA) efficiency. Trellis shaping (TS) is an effective method to reduce PAPR without signal distortion by exploiting the trellis structure at the transmitter. In practice, OFDM should be combined with channel coding in order to achieve frequency diversity effect. In this paper, we propose a serial concatenation of channel coding and trellis shaping such that the frequency diversity effect and peak power reduction can be simultaneously achieved. A novel BCJR-based LLR metric calculation for trellis shaping bits is introduced for this purpose. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by simulation over AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Achievable Gains in Peak Power Reduction via Single-Carrier Distribution Shaping</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD.This paper presents a method to find a lower bound on the peak power reduction of single carrier signals having low rolloff pulse shaping filter, and transmitted over the Additive White Gaussian Noise channel (AWGN). Peak power as well as any other property can be controlled by judiciously choosing a codebook, such that the peak power of any of the codewords does not exceed a threshold (or exceeds in a low probability). One of the methods to generate such codebook, called shaping, is to start with a larger codebook with i.i.d. uniform distribution and choose a subcode which optimizes the property. This approach includes the popular method of Trellis Shaping. We analyze the limit of the gains obtainable by the shaping method by using the conditional limit theorem under Markov conditioning, and by that we can show achievable peak reduction bounds. We analyze two types of receivers. The first is a receiver that is matched to the subcode, i.e., it is aware of the dilution made at the transmitter, and the second is a mismatched decoder, a decoder for the original large codebook, like in the case of Trellis Shaping. We show that significant peak and Peak to Average (PAR) gains, as large as 2 dB, are achievable, even for small constellations such as 16QAM and 16APSK transmission constellations for Square Root Raised Cosine filter (SRRC) with rolloff 0.1.</abstract>

        <abstract>We design a data-dependent metric in Rd and use it to define the k- nearest neighbors of a given point. Our metric is invariant under all affine transformations. We show that, with this metric, the standard k-nearest neighbor regression estimate is asymptotically consistent under the usual conditions on k, and minimal requirements on the input data.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Linear Coherent Estimation with Spatial Collaboration</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a power-constrained sensor network, consisting of multiple sensor nodes and a fusion center (FC), that is deployed for the purpose of estimating a common random parameter of interest. In contrast to the distributed framework, the sensor nodes are allowed to update their individual observations by (linearly) combining observations from neighboring nodes. The updated observations are communicated to the FC using an analog amplify-and-forward modulation scheme and through a coherent multiple access channel. The optimal collaborative strategy is obtained by minimizing the cumulative transmission power subject to a maximum distortion constraint. For the distributed scenario (i.e., with no observation sharing), the solution reduces to the power-allocation problem considered by Xiao et. al. [IEEE TSP, 2008]. Collaboration among neighbors significantly improves power efficiency of the network in the low local-SNR regime, as demonstrated through an insightful example and numerical simulations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Modeling Spatially-Dependent Extreme Events with Markov Random Field Priors</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A novel spatial model for extreme events is proposed. The model may for instance be used to describe the occurrence of catastrophic events such as earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes in certain regions; it may therefore be relevant for, e.g., weather forecasting, urban planning, and environmental assessment. The model is derived from the following ideas: The above-threshold values at each location are assumed to follow a generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. The GP parameters are coupled across space through Markov random fields, in particular, thin-membrane models. The latter are inferred through an empirical Bayes approach. Numerical results are presented for synthetic and real data (related to hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Signal Detection Algorithms for Two-Dimensional Intersymbol-Interference Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We develop several novel signal detection algorithms for two-dimensional intersymbol-interference channels. The core in all these schemes is a modified one-dimensional maximum a-posteriori (MAP) detection algorithm that operates over single and multiple rows providing a balanced performance vs. complexity tradeoff. We explore 2-D iterative algorithms that operate by feeding extrinsic information from multi-row/column detectors in a turbo fashion. Multi-row/column MAP detection using 2-D turbo-processing yields more than 2 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain compared to a non-iterative multi-row detector over the additive white Gaussian channel and within 0.1 dB of the ML estimate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Sparse Signal Recovery in Hilbert Spaces</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper reports an effort to consolidate numerous coherence-based sparse signal recovery results available in the literature. We present a single theory that applies to general Hilbert spaces with the sparsity of a signal defined as the number of (possibly infinite-dimensional) subspaces participating in the signal's representation. Our general results recover uncertainty relations and coherence-based recovery thresholds for sparse signals, block-sparse signals, multi-band signals, signals in shift-invariant spaces, and signals in finite unions of (possibly infinite-dimensional) subspaces. Moreover, we improve upon and generalize several of the existing results and, in many cases, we find shortened and simplified proofs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Sampling a High-Dimensional Bandlimited Field on a Union of Shifted Lattices</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider the problem of sampling a high-dimensional bandlimited field on a union of shifted lattices. The known results on conditions for perfect reconstruction for this problem are difficult to state explicitly and the known reconstruction schemes are iterative algorithms. We study this problem under certain assumptions motivated by some practical sampling applications. Under these assumptions, we show that simple necessary and sufficient conditions for perfect reconstruction can be identified. We also obtain an explicit scheme for reconstructing the field from its samples on the various shifted lattices. We illustrate our results using examples.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Recovery of Sparse 1-D Signals from the Magnitudes of their Fourier Transform</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of signal recovery from their autocorrelation, or equivalently the magnitudes of their Fourier Transform, is of paramount importance in various fields of engineering. In this work, we show that for one-dimensional signals, unique recovery is possible from their autocorrelation with very high probability if the sparsity of the signal is known. We also develop non-iterative recovery algorithms for extraction of sparse signals from their autocorrelation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified by simulations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Generalized Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We extend the concept of faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling to linear digital modulation signals using arbitrary modulation pulses, called generalized faster-than-Nyquist signaling (GFTN). A universal definition of nominal bandwidth is given so that &quot;how fast&quot; can be measured for GFTN like FTN that using T-orthogonal pulses. The capacities and their asymptotic behaviors are compared between GFTN and Nyquist signaling. We show that the gain of GFTN increases unboundedly with SNR. In high SNR regime the power gain is usually considerable.Our extension from FTN to GFTN gives more freedom on the design of pulses to achieve good performance and acceptable detection complexity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Explicit construction of universal strongly secure network coding via MRD codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The universal strongly secure network coding scheme allows communication at maximum rate while ensuring that, independently from the underlying network code, no part of the secret message is deterministically leaked to the wiretapper. Although Silva and Kschischang showed the existence of such scheme, the explicit construction has still remained an open question. This paper demonstrates an explicit construction of the scheme that uses secret sharing schemes based on maximum rank distance (MRD) codes, which can be viewed as the generalization of Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme.</abstract>

        <papertitle>List-decoding of Subspace Codes and Rank-Metric Codes up to Singleton Bound</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Subspace codes and rank-metric codes can be used to correct errors and erasures in network, with linear network coding. Both types of codes have been extensively studied in the past five years.&#13;
&#13;
Subspace codes were introduced by Koetter and Kschischang to correct errors and erasures in networks where topology is unknown (the noncoherent case). In this model, the codewords are vector subspaces of a fixed ambient space; thus codes for this model are collections of such subspaces. In a previous work, we have developed a family of subspace codes, based upon the Koetter-Kschichang construction, which are efficiently list decodable. Using these codes, we achieved a better decoding radius than Koetter-Kschischiang codes at low rates. Herein, we introduce a new family of subspace codes based upon a different approach which leads to a linear-algebraic list-decoding algorithm. The resulting error correction radius can be expressed as follows: for any integer $s$, our list-decoder using $s+1$-interpolation polynomials guarantees successful recovery of the message subspace provided the normalized dimension of errors is at most $s(1-sR)$. The same list-decoding algorithm can be used to correct erasures as well as errors. The size of output list is at most $Q^{s-1}$, where $Q$ is the size of the field that message symbols are chosen from. &#13;
&#13;
Rank-metric codes are suitable for error correction in the case where the network topology and the underlying network code are known (the coherent case). Gabidulin codes are a well-known class of algebraic rank-metric codes that meet the Singleton bound on the minimum rank metric of a code. In this paper, we introduce a folded version of Gabidulin codes analogous to the folded Reed-Solomon codes of Guruswami and Rudra along with a list-decoding algorithm for such codes. Our list-decoding algorithm makes it possible to recover the message provided that the normalized rank of error is at most $1-R-\epsilon$, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Notably this achieves the information theoretic bound on the decoding radius of a rank-metric code.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Matroidal Framework for Network-Error Correcting Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Matroidal networks were introduced by Dougherty et al. and have been well studied in the recent past. It was shown that a network has a scalar linear network coding solution if and only if it is matroidal associated with a representable matroid. The current work attempts to establish a connection between matroid theory and network-error correcting codes. In a similar vein to the theory connecting matroids and network coding, we abstract the essential aspects of network-error correcting codes to arrive at the definition of a matroidal error correcting network. An acyclic network (with arbitrary sink demands) is then shown to possess a scalar linear error correcting network code if and only if there it is a matroidal error correcting network associated with a representable matroid. Therefore, constructing such network-error correcting codes implies the construction of certain representable matroids that satisfy some special conditions, and vice versa.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Matroidal undirected network</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The undirected graphical model is generalized to a linear matroid. The optimal direction for multicasting can be found in polynomial time with respect to the size of the network. A more general problem is also considered where certain function of a distributed source is to be computed at multiple nodes. The converse results are derived, not from the usual cut-set bound but through the related problem of secret key agreement and secure source coding by public discussion. A unifying model of partly directed network can also be formulated, covering both the directed and undirected networks as special cases.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The DoF of the K-user Interference Channel with a Cognitive Relay</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. In previous work, it was shown that the 2-user interference channel with a cognitive relay (IC-CR) has full degrees of freedom (DoF) almost surely, i.e., 2 DoF. The purpose of this work is to check whether the DoF of the $K$-user IC-CR follow as a straight forward extension of the 2-user case. As it turns out, this is not the case. The $K$-user IC-CR is shown to have $2K/3$ DoF if $K&gt;2$ for the time varying case, achievable using interference alignment. Furthermore, the DoF region of the 3-user constant IC-CR is characterized using interference neutralization, and a new upper bound on the sum-capacity if the 2-user IC-CR is given. As a conclusion, while the basic $K$-user IC with time varying channel coefficients has 1/2 DoF per user for all $K$, the $K$-user IC-CR has one DoF per user if $K=2$ and $2/3$ DoF per user if $K&gt;2$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lattice Coding and the Generalized Degrees of Freedom of the Interference Channel with Relay</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. The generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the symmetric two-user Gaussian interference relay channel (IRC) is studied. While it is known that the relay does not increase the DoF of the IC, this is not known for the more general GDoF. For the characterization of the GDoF, new sum-capacity upper bounds and lower bounds are derived. The lower bounds are obtained by a new scheme, which is based on functional decode-and-forward (FDF). The GDoF is characterized for the regime in which the source-relay link is weaker than the interference link, which constitutes half of the overall space of all possible parameters. It is shown that the relay can indeed increase the GDoF of the IRC and that it is achieved by FDF.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Guiding Blind Transmitters: Relay-aided Interference Alignment for the X channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. This paper investigates the impact of half-duplex relays on the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the K-user X channel when the transmitters are blind in the sense that no channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) is available. It is shown that adding relay nodes with CSI to the communication model is sufficient to recover the optimal DoF with CSIT. In particular, the relay nodes help steer the directions of the transmitted signals to facilitate interference alignment to achieve the optimal DoF. It is shown that one relay node with $K-1$ antennas is sufficient to achieve the optimal DoF. When relays do not have multiple antennas, it is sufficient to have $(K-1)^2$ relays to achieve the optimal DoF. The achievability is established using partial interference alignment and joint beamforming. DoF for the case when relays only have delayed CSI is also investigated.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Broadcast Approaches to Dual-Hop Parallel Relay Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper studies the problem of dual-hop transmission from a source to a destination via two parallel full-duplex relays in block Rayleigh fading environment. All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their forward-channel gains, however, they have perfect information about their backward-channel gains. We also assume a stringent decoding delay constraint of one fading block that makes the definition of ergodic (Shannon) capacity meaningless. Hence, we adopt the broadcast approach to increase the expected-rate received at the destination. The focus of this paper is on simple, efficient, and practical relaying schemes to increase the average achievable rate at the destination. The maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward relaying is analytically derived. For further performance improvement, a hybrid decode-amplify-forward relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach at the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and expected-rate are presented. Finally, two different upper-bounds, based on the full cooperation between the relays, are obtained. All theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations. As it turns out from the numerical results, when the ratio of the relay power to the source power is low, the proposed hybrid decode-amplify-forward relaying scheme meets the obtained upper-bound.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the information content of scattered waves</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A basic trade-off between spatial and frequency diversities available for communication with multiple scattered waves is presented. A rigorous notion of the total number of space-frequency degrees of freedom of the field is intro- duced based on Slepian's theory of spectral concentration of L2 functions. This definition agrees with the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; of multiplying the degrees of freedom available in space and frequency. However, while the mathematical definition requires both frequency and spatial bandwidths to scale simultaneously, a physical argument precludes such a scaling to occur in practice. Hence, since the nature of wireless communication prevents unbounded and simultaneous spatial and frequency diversity gains, rule of thumb definitions of degrees of freedom should be taken with care as they are inherently imprecise.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Degrees of Freedom of Sparsely Connected Wireless Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We investigate how the network connectivity can affect the total degrees of freedom (DoF) of wireless networks. We consider a network of $n$ source--destination (SD) pairs and assume that any two nodes are connected with a positive probability, independent of other node pairs. We show that, for any set of connectivity probabilities, a constant fraction of DoF is achievable for each SD pair in the limit of large $n$. Specifically, for sufficiently large $n$, each SD pair can achieve at least $1/3$ DoF for full-duplex and $1/4$ DoF for half-duplex at both time-varying and static connectivities. The achievability is based on two-hop transmission and interference alignment is applied to each hop. Considering that an achievable DoF for direct or one-hop transmission can be arbitrarily small as the connectivity probabilities decrease, our result shows that, somewhat surprisingly, two-hop transmission is enough for each SD pair to guarantee non-vanishing DoF for any set of arbitrarily small connectivity probabilities.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Hierarchical Beamforming for Large One-Dimensional Wireless Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a wireless network with a large number of nodes distributed over a line. Under line-of-sight propagation, this network has only one degree of freedom for communication. At high SNR, this one-degree of freedom can be readily achieved by multi-hop. At low SNR, however, the performance is dominated by the power transfer in the network. We show that none of the existing architectures, neither hierarchical cooperation nor multi-hop, can achieve optimal scaling of the capacity. We develop a digital hierarchical beamforming architecture and show that it is scaling optimal. This result reveals a new regime for large wireless networks where beamforming techniques are needed to achieve capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Degrees of Freedom (DoF) of Locally Connected Interference Channels with Cooperating Multiple-Antenna Transmitters</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider locally connected K-user MISO interference channels where each transmitter has N antennas and is connected to the receiver with the same index as well as $\lfloor \frac{L}{2} \rfloor$ successively preceding receivers and $ \lceil \frac{L}{2} \rceil$ following receivers. We assume that each receiver is interested in one message, which can be available at a maximum of M transmitters. Under these assumptions, we study the available degrees of freedom as well as the optimal way to assign messages to transmitters. For the case where each message is assigned to the transmitter with the same index, we know from [1] that $KN/(N+1)$ DoF is achievable for the considered locally connected channel using interference alignment as the number of symbol extensions goes to infinity. In this work, we show that a simple linear strategy employing zero forcing transmit beams achieves min{(2MN)/(M(N+1)+L),1} per user degrees of freedom. In particular, the $N/(N+1)$ per user DoF is achievable by coding over only one channel realization, for any value of $M \geq L/(N+1)$. Moreover, we show that the proposed scheme is optimal among a class of linear strategies where each receiver is either inactive or enjoys interference-free communication. Finally, we generalize the upper bound proved for Wyner's asymmetric channel model (L=1) in [2], and show that message assignments satisfying a local cooperation constraint are optimal for a general setting of the parameters. &#13;

        <papertitle>On Linear Transforms in Zero-delay Gaussian Source Channel Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper is concerned with the optimal linear transforms in zero-delay source channel coding for Gaussian sources and channels. In preparation for the main results, we first consider the classical problem in the point-to-point setting, which had already been solved by Lee and Petersen, where we provide an alternative proof using majorization. We then analyze the performance of linear source-channel coding in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We show that at asymptotically low SNR, or equivalently as the power tends to zero, the power-distortion function of zero delay linear coding achieves optimum theoretically achievable performance. Finally, we consider zero-delay source-channel coding with decoder side information. Here, subject to structural constraints on the encoder, we find the optimal encoder-decoder pair in closed form. We analyze two structures: i) the encoder is constrained to be linear where we show that the optimal transform is product of matrices including as factor the conditional Karhunen Lo\'eve transform (KLT) of the source given the side information. ii) the encoder consists of linear transformation followed by individual optimal nonlinear mapping of each transform coefficient. Using majorization principles, we show that the optimal transform does not depend on the nonlinearities introduced, as long as they are scale invariant, hence the optimal transform is also a product involving the conditional KLT of the source.</abstract>

        <abstract>We derive a random-coding upper bound on the average probability of error of joint source-channel coding that recovers Csiszár's error exponent when used with product distributions over the channel inputs. Our proof technique for the error probability analysis employs a code construction for which source messages are assigned to subsets and codewords are generated with a distribution that depends on the subset.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lossy joint source-channel coding in the finite blocklength regime</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper shows new tight finite-blocklength bounds for the best achievable lossy joint source-channel code rate, and demonstrates that joint source-channel code design brings considerable performance advantage over a separate one in the non-asymptotic regime. A joint source-channel code maps a block of $k$ source symbols onto a length$-n$ channel codeword, and the fidelity of reproduction at the receiver end is measured by the probability $\epsilon$ that the distortion exceeds a given threshold $d$. In the i.i.d. case, it is demonstrated that the parameters of the best joint source-channel code must satisfy $nC - kR(d) \approx \sqrt{nV + k \mathcal V(d)} \Qinv{\epsilon}$, where $C$ and $V$ are the channel capacity and dispersion, respectively; $R(d)$ and $\mathcal V(d)$ are the source rate-distortion and rate-dispersion functions; and $Q$ is the standard Gaussian complementary cdf.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Update Efficient Codes for Error Correction</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An update efficient code is a mapping from messages to codewords such that small perturbations in the message induce only slight changes to the corresponding codeword. The parameter that captures this notion is called update-efficiency. In this paper we study update-efficient error-correcting codes and develop their basic properties. While update-efficiency and error-correction are two conflicting objectives, we deduce conditions for existence of such codes. In particular, logarithmically growing update-efficiency is achievable with a capacity-achieving linear code in both binary symmetric and binary erasure channels. On the other hand we show a tight converse result. Our result implies that it is not possible to have a capacity-achieving code in binary symmetric channel that has sub-logarithmic update-efficiency. This is true in the case of the binary erasure channel as well for linear codes. We also discuss a number of questions related to update-efficient adversarial error-correcting codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On some properties of a check digit system</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we consider check digit systems which are based on the use of elementary abelian $p$-groups of order $p^k$. The work is inspired by a recently introduced check digit system for hexadecimal numbers. By interpreting its check equation in terminology of matrix algebra, we generalize the idea to build systems over a group of order $p^k$, while keeping the ability to detect all the 1) single errors, 2) adjacent transpositions, 3) twin errors, 4) jump transpositions and 5) jump twin errors.&#13;
&#13;
Besides, we consider two categories of jump errors: $t$-jump transpositions and $t$-jump twin errors, which include and further extend the double error types of 2)-5). In particular, we explore the capacity range of the system to detect these two kinds of generalized jump errors. We show that it is $2^k-3$ for $p=2$ and $(p^k-1)/2-2$ for an odd prime $p$. Also, we show how to build such a system that detects all the single errors and these two kinds of double jump-errors within the capacity range.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Computing Extensions of Linear Codes using a Greedy Algorithm</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper deals with the problem of increasing the minimum distance of a linear code by adding one or more columns to the generator matrix. We present a simple greedy algorithm which surprisingly yields many codes improving the previously known lower bounds on the minimum distance. We also discuss variations of the algorithm that succeed when the greedy algorithm fails.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Algebraic Framework for Concatenated Linear Block Codes in Side Information Based Problems</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This work provides an algebraic framework for source coding with decoder side information and its dual problem, channel coding with encoder side information, showing that nested concatenated codes can achieve the corresponding rate-distortion and capacity-noise bounds. We show that code concatenation preserves the nested properties of codes and that only one of the concatenated codes needs to be nested, which opens up a wide range of possible new code combinations for these side information based problems. In particular, the practically important binary version of these problems can be addressed by concatenating binary inner and non-binary outer linear codes. By observing that list decoding with folded Reed- Solomon codes is asymptotically optimal for encoding IID q-ary sources and that in concatenation with inner binary codes it can asymptotically achieve the rate-distortion bound for a Bernoulli symmetric source, we illustrate our findings with a new algebraic construction which comprises concatenated nested cyclic codes and binary linear block codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rate Allocation for Component Codes of Plotkin-Type UEP Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we present an analysis on the performance of Plotkin-type UEP codes by using threshold and equivalent channel model under the Gaussian assumption. Specifically,we give a framework on how to assign the rate of each component code of this Plotkin-type UEP code so that the goal of UEP is successfully achieved with far better overall BER performance. The result is surprising in that which component code should be assigned for MSB can be changed according to the assigned rate of each component code and overall rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Synchrony Amplification</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Various protocols in the cryptography and distributed systems literature assume some notion of time: One major (but not the only) example are &quot;synchronous&quot; models which assume that a protocol is executed in a well-defined sequence of rounds with round switches that occur (almost) simultaneously at the parties. In many of the considered models, the notion of time is either implicit, or it is closely interweaved with other mechanics of the model such that formally proving even simple statements becomes a tedious task.&#13;
&#13;
In this work, we develop an abstract formal model that captures exactly how the availability of clocks with &quot;weak&quot; synchrony guarantees can benefit parties; in particular, we show how---and at what cost---the &quot;synchrony&quot; of clocks can be improved. Proofs in this model are simple and the statements transfer to all models that satisfy the abstraction.&#13;
&#13;
The main contribution of this paper is not the actual statements we prove (which mostly verify folklore beliefs), but the formal model that follows the construction paradigm of abstract cryptography and allows to state these proofs in a simple yet rigorous manner. Indeed, the paper is a step towards a treatment of synchronous cryptographic protocols in this constructive sense.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Perfectly Secure Encryption of Individual Sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In analogy to the well-known notion of finite-state compressibility of individual sequences, due to Lempel and Ziv, we define a similar notion of ``finite-state encryptability'' of an individual plaintext sequence, as the minimum asymptotic key rate that must be consumed by finite-state encrypters so as to guarantee perfect secrecy in a well-defined sense. Our main basic result is that the finite-state encryptability is equal to the finite-state compressibility for every individual sequence. This is in parallelism to Shannon's classical probabilistic counterpart result, asserting that the minimum required key rate is equal to the entropy rate of the source. However, the redundancy, defined as the gap between the upper bound (direct part) and the lower bound (converse part) in the encryption problem, turns out to decay at a different rate (in fact, much slower) than the analogous redundancy associated with the compression problem. We also extend our main theorem, allowing: (i) availability of side information (SI) at the encrypter/decrypter/eavesdropper, (ii) lossy reconstruction at the decrypter.</abstract>

        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&#13;
&#13;
This paper investigates how to design an error-free and perfectly secure system. In particular, we are interested in the relation between the amount of key consumed in an EPS system and the amount of errors between the source's true probability distribution and the estimated distribution we used to construct the EPS system. Results obtained in this paper can also be applied to study the tradeoff between key consumption and the number of channel uses needed to transmitted the encrypted message.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Fast-CSMA Based Distributed Scheduling Algorithm under SINR Model</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>There has been substantial interest over the last decade in developing low complexity decentralized scheduling algorithms in wireless networks. In this context, the queuelength based Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) scheduling algorithms have attracted significant attention because of their attractive throughput guarantees. However, the CSMA results rely on the mixing of the underlying Markov chain and their performance under fading channel states is unknown. In this work, we formulate a partially decentralized randomized scheduling algorithm for a two transmitter receiver pair set up and investigate its stability properties. Our work is based on the Fast-CSMA (FCSMA) algorithm first developed in [1] and we extend its results to a signal to interference noise ration(SINR) based interference model in which one or more transmitters can transmit simultaneously while causing interference to the other. In order to improve the performance of the system, we split the traffic arriving at the transmitter into schedule based queues and combine it with the FCSMA based scheduling algorithm. We theoretically examine the performance our algorithm in both non-fading and fading environment and characterize the set of arrival rates which can be stabilized by our proposed algorithm.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Upper Bound for the Capacity of Multiple Access Protocols on Multipacket Reception Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>While there have been many research on the capacity of the collision channel for multiple access protocols, there has only been little investigation for multipacket reception (MPR)-capable channels, which allows more than one simultaneous transmissions to be successfully received. In this paper we investigate the properties of these MPR channels and provide an upper bound for their multiaccess capacities with a genie-aided argument. Our results not only give insights into the limiting efficiency with which multiaccessing can be performed in the MPR environment, they are also generalization of familiar results from classical multiaccess theory.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Effect of Channel Estimation Errors on the Stability of Channel-Aware Random Access</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work, we consider a system with time-varying channels and random access that exploits the channel state information (CSI). The CSI is not directly available to each node but estimated with some errors. An exact stability analysis is carried out for the considered model when a pair of bursty sources are competing for a shared channel and the receiver has multipacket reception capability. The contributions in the paper are twofold: first, we identify the effect of channel estimation errors on the achievable stability region of the channel-aware random access protocol. Secondly, we make a comparison with the class of stationary scheduling policies.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Random Access Compressed Sensing over Fading and Noisy Communication Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Random Access Compressed Sensing (RACS) is an efficient method for data telemetry from a network of distributed sensors deployed in a challenging field environment with limited resources. RACS relies on integrating sensing with the communication architecture, in order to achieve overall efficiency in terms of the energy per bit of information successfully delivered to the fusion center. Targeting realistic deployment conditions, we consider data gathering over a Ricean fading channel and in the presence of communication noise. We provide a framework for system design and study the energy and bandwidth requirements of the network. We then show that compared to a conventional TDMA network with ARQ, RACS achieves significant energy and bandwidth savings. For example, for a network of 4000 nodes, we observe 10 dB gain in the energy as well as a 2.5-fold reduction in the required bandwidth.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Partial Kelly Portfolios and Shrinkage Estimators</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The log-optimal or Kelly portfolio forms the basis of a theoretically appealing investment strategy. However, it is difficult to compute, and this hinders its adoption in practice. In this paper we consider an approximate Kelly portfolio based on maximizing the expected value of a quadratic approximation to log utility. We show that this semi-log approximation gives an information-theoretic justification for portfolio selection based on either the mean-variance efficient frontier or the Sharpe ratio. We further show that there is a strong connection between estimated approximate fractional Kelly portfolios and shrinkage estimators, which leads to an optimal choice of a fractional Kelly parameter. We conclude by showing that the fractional Kelly portfolio succeeds not because of reduced risk, but because of reduced estimation error. We simulate to show that this property is largely responsible for the good empirical performance of fractional Kelly strategies.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Constant Markov Portfolio and its Application to Universal Portfolio with Side Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We analyze properties of Constant Markov Portfolio (CMP), which we proposed as a generalized notion of Constantly Rebalanced Portfolio (CRP) in 2011, and present its generalization. In particular, we show the algorithm for exact computation of the Bayesian strategy for CMP by extending the algorithm for CRP given by Cover &amp; Ordentlich in 1996. Further, we propose a generalization of CMP in order to design a strategy which employs the option of cash as side information. We show an efficient approximation algorithm to compute the universal strategy for the model based on EM algorithm.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Estimating Multiset of Bernoulli Processes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Motivated by applications of estimating load or aggregate usage by service providers like websites or electricity companies, we consider two related problems of estimating the multiset of parameters of a collection of processes. In the Poisson multiset estimation problem, the activities of different users are modeled as independent Poisson processes. The objective is to estimate the multiset of Poisson parameters given a sample of the user activities over a fixed period of time t. Similarly, in the Bernoulli multiset estimation problem, user activities are modeled as Bernoulli processes and we want to estimate the multiset of activity probabilities from observations over n time instants.&#13;
&#13;
For both problems, it is sufficient to consider the profile of the observations, that conveys the multiset of counts of activities of the users, without referring to their identities. We study the profile maximum likelihood (PML) estimator for these problems, that outputs the parameter multiset maximizing the likelihood of the profile. We show competitive estimation guarantees for this estimator that hold irrespective of the number of processes k. For Poisson processes, if the error probability of some estimator in some metric is at most delta, the PML estimator has error probability at most delta * exp(4*sqrt(t*S)) where S is the sum of the Poisson parameters. A similar guarantee of delta * exp(4*sqrt(n*S)) error probability holds for Bernoulli processes. For the specific case of L1 distance metric, we relate the problems to the long studied distribution estimation problem and leverage recent results to show that the PML estimator has error probability exp(-(t*S)^(0.9)) or exp(-(n*S)^(0.9)) whenever k = O(t*S*log(t*S)) or O(n*S*log(n*S)). We also show experimental results using an EM algorithm for the computation of PML.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The minimax risk of truncated series estimators for symmetric convex polytopes</papertitle>

        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot;&#13;
&#13;
We study the optimality of the minimax risk of truncated series estimators for symmetric convex polytopes. We show that the optimal truncated series estimator is within $O(log m)$ factor of the optimal if the polytope is defined by $m$ hyperplanes. This represents the first such bounds towards general convex bodies. In proving our result, we first define a geometric quantity, called the approximation radius, for lower bounding the minimax risk. We then derive our bounds by establishing a connection between the approximation radius and the Kolmogorov width, the quantity that provides upper bounds for the truncated series estimator. Besides, our proof contains several ingredients which might be of independent interest: 1. The notion of approximation radius depends on the volume of the body. It is an intuitive notion and is flexible to yield strong minimax lower bounds; 2. The connection between the approximation radius and the Kolmogorov width is a consequence of a novel duality relationship on the Kolmogorov width, developed by utilizing some classical results from convex geometry.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Phase Transitions in Compressed Sensing with Noisy Measurements</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Compressed sensing deals with efficient recovery of analog signals from linear measurements. This paper presents a statistical study of compressed sensing by modeling the input signal as a random processes. Three classes of encoders are considered, namely, optimal nonlinear, optimal linear and random linear encoders. Focusing on optimal decoders, we investigate the fundamental tradeoff between measurement rate and reconstruction fidelity gauged by the noise sensitivity. Optimal phase-transition thresholds are determined as a functional of the input distribution and compared to suboptimal thresholds achieved by various popular reconstruction algorithms. In particular, we show that Gaussian sensing matrices incur no penalty on the phase-transition threshold with respect to optimal nonlinear encoding. Our results also provide a rigorous justification of previous results based on replica heuristics in the weak-noise regime.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Universality in Polytope Phase Transitions and Iterative Algorithms</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a class of nonlinear mappings $\F_{A,N}$ in $\reals^N$ indexed by symmetric random matrices $A\in\reals^{N\times N}$ with independent entries. Within spin glass theory, special cases of these mappings correspond to iterating the TAP equations and were studied by Erwin Bolthausen. Within information theory, they are in correspondence with `approximate message passing' algorithms. We study the high-dimensional (large $N$) behavior of the iterates of $\F_{A,N}$, and prove that it is universal, i.e. it depends only on the first two moments of the entries of $A$, under suitable tail conditions. As an application, we prove the universality of a certain phase transition arising in polytope geometry and compressed sensing. This solves a conjecture by David Donoho and Jared Tanner.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Compressed Measurements Needed for Noisy Distributed Compressed Sensing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we consider a data collection network (DCN) system where sensors take samples and transmit them to a Fusion Center (FC). Signal correlation is modeled with signal sparseness. The number of compressed measurements which allows correct support set recovery at FC is investigated. This is done by finding the probability of support set recovery errors. The joint typical receiver considered by Akcakaya and Tarokh is used to avoid dependence on particular choice of recovery routines. The following interesting results have been obtained: 1) The number of compressed measurements per sensor (PSM) converges to sparsity as the number of sensors increases. 2) The detection failure probability linearly converges to zero as the number of sensors increases. 3) The number of sensors guaranteeing a certain level of failure probability is given the system parameters such as Gaussian noise variance, PSM, and sparsity.</abstract>

In statistical physics and information theory, although the exponent of the partition function is often of our primary interest, there are cases where one needs more detailed information. In this paper, we present a general framework to study more precise asymptotic behaviors of the partition function, using the central approximation in conjunction with the method of types.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An information-theoretic meta-theorem on edge-cut bounds</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of multiple unicast in wireline networks. Edge-cut based bounds which are simple bounds on the rates achievable by routing flow are not in general, fundamental, i.e. they are not outer bounds on the capacity region. It has been observed that when the problem has some kind of symmetry involved, then flows and edge-cut based bounds are `close', i.e. within a constant or poly-logarithmic factor of each other. In this paper, we make the observation that in these very cases, such edge-cut based bounds are actually `close' to fundamental yielding an approximate characterization of the capacity region for these problems. We demonstrate this in the case of $k$-unicast in undirected networks, $k$-pair unicast in directed networks with symmetric demands i.e. for every source communicating to a destination at a certain rate, the destination communicates an independent message back to the source at the same rate, and sum-rate of $k$-groupcast in directed networks, i.e. a group of nodes, each of which has an independent message for every other node in the group. We place our work in context of existing results to suggest a meta-theorem: if there is inherent symmetry either in the network connectivity or in the traffic pattern, then edge-cut bounds are near-fundamental and flows approximately achieve capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Symmetrical Multilevel Diversity Coding with an All-Access Encoder</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Symmetrical Multilevel Diversity Coding (SMDC) is a network compression problem introduced by Roche (1992) and Yeung (1995). This paper considers a generalization of SMDC for which, in addition to the randomly accessible encoders, there is also an all-access encoder. It is shown that a simple separate coding strategy known as superposition coding is optimal in terms of achieving the entire admissible rate region of the problem. Key to our proof is to identify the supporting hyperplanes that define the boundary of the admissible rate region and then builds on the result of Yeung and Zhang on a generalization of Han's subset inequality.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Network Coding Capacity under On-Off Scheduling</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We examine network coding capacities of arbitrary networks under the scheduling constraint that at most p edges are used for transmission at each time. We examine this setup under two notions of network capacity - throughput per unit time and rate per channel use. We show that the throughput vectors achievable per unit time for this setup are a constant multiplicative factor away from those achievable when all edges transmit at all time instants. In contrast, the rate vectors achievable per channel use are the same for both the setups. We use these results to show that throughput and rate are equivalent notions of network capacity when there are no scheduling constraints.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Non-coherent Network Coding: An Arbitrarily Varying Channel Approach</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we propose an &quot;arbitrarily varying channel&quot; (AVC) approach to study the capacity of non-coherent transmission in a network that employs randomized linear network coding. The network operation is modeled by a matrix channel over a finite field where the transfer matrix changes arbitrarily from time-slot to time-slot but up to a known distribution over its rank. By extending the AVC results to this setup, we characterize the capacity of such a non-coherent transmission scheme and show that subspace coding is optimal for achieving the capacity. &#13;
&#13;
By imposing a probability distribution over the state space of an AVC, we obtain a channel which we called &quot;partially arbitrarily varying channel&quot; (PAVC). In this work, we characterize the &quot;randomized&quot; as well as the &quot;deterministic&quot; code capacity of a PAVC under the average error probability criterion. Although we introduce the PAVC to model the non-coherent network coding, this extension to an AVC might be of its own interest as well.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Short Message Noisy Network Coding for Multiple Sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Short message noisy network coding (SNNC) transmits independent short messages in blocks rather than using long message repetitive encoding. SNNC is shown to achieve the same rates as noisy network coding (NNC) for discrete memoryless networks where each node transmits a multicast message. One advantage of SNNC is that backward decoding may be used which simplifies the analysis and understanding of the achievability proof. The analysis reveals that each decoder may ignore certain other nodes rather than including their message in the decoding procedure. Additionally, SNNC enables early decoding at nodes if the channel quality happens to be good.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wyner-Ziv Type Versus Noisy Network Coding For a State-Dependent MAC</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a two-user state-dependent multiaccess channel in which the states of the channel are known non-causally to one of the encoders and only strictly causally to the other encoder. Both encoders transmit a common message and, in addition, the encoder that knows the states non-causally transmits an individual message. We find explicit characterizations of the capacity region of this communication model in both discrete memoryless and memoryless Gaussian cases. The analysis also reveals optimal ways of exploiting the knowledge of the state only strictly causally at the encoder that sends only the common message when such a knowledge is beneficial. The encoders collaborate to convey to the decoder a lossy version of the state, in addition to transmitting the information messages through a generalized Gel'fand-Pinsker binning. Particularly important in this problem are the questions of 1) optimal ways of performing the state compression and 2) whether or not the compression indices should be decoded uniquely. We show that both compression \`a-la noisy network coding, i.e., with no binning, and compression using Wyner-Ziv binning are optimal. The scheme that uses Wyner-Ziv binning shares elements with Cover and El Gamal original compress-and-forward, but differs from it mainly in that backward decoding is employed instead of forward decoding and the compression indices are not decoded uniquely. Finally, by exploring the properties of our outer bound, we show that, although not required in general, the compression indices can in fact be decoded uniquely essentially without altering the capacity region, but at the expense of larger alphabets sizes for the auxiliary random variables.</abstract>

        <abstract>``THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot;. We consider a two-user multiple-access channel, where one of the encoders is allowed to take an action that effects the formation of the channel states. The states are know non-causally to the encoder. Two independent messages are sent: a common message and a private message transmitted by the informed encoder. We find precise characterizations of the capacity region. Our framework takes account of previously evaluated settings regarding point-to-point channels with actions and multiple-access channels with common messages. We obtain the capacity of the Gaussian action-dependent point-to-point channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Capacity Region of the Finite State MAC with Cooperative Encoders and Delayed CSI</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, a single-letter characterization for the capacity region of finite-state multiple access channels with partially cooperative encoders is derived. Partial cooperation here is in the sense that the encoders communicate with each other through finite-capacity links. The channel states are assumed to be governed by a Markov processes. Full channel state information (CSI) is assumed at the receiver, while only delayed CSI is available at transmitters. The capacity region is derived by first solving the case of finite-state multiple access channels with common message, using rate splitting, multiplexing and simultaneous decoding in order to establish the achievability. The common message result is then used to derive the capacity region of the partially cooperative encoder case. Finally, we apply this result in order to obtain the capacity region for a finite-state Gaussian MAC with partially cooperative encoders.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multiple Access Channel with Various Degrees of Asymmetric State Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of reliable communication over multiple-access channels (MAC) where the channel is driven by an independent and identically distributed state process and the encoders and the decoder are provided with various degrees of asymmetric (noisy or partial) channel state information (CSI). Namely, we provide a single letter characterization for the capacity region when the encoders have access to non-causal asymmetric partial CSI and the decoder has complete CSI. When the encoders observe asymmetric noisy CSI with asymmetric delays and the decoder observes complete CSI, we provide a single letter characterization for the capacity region. Finally, we consider a cooperative scenario with common and private messages, with noisy CSIT and complete CSIR and provide a single letter expression for the capacity region. For the cooperative scenario, we also note that as soon as the common message encoder does not have access to CSI, then for any noisy CSIT and CSIR setup it is possible to obtain a single letter characterization for the capacity region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Achievable Rate Regions for the Dirty Multiple Access Channel with Partial Side Information at the Transmitters</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we establish achievable rate regions for the multiple access channel (MAC) with side information partially known (estimated or sensed version) at the transmitters. Actually, we extend the lattice strategies used by Philosof-Zamir for the MAC with full side information at the transmitters to the partially known case. We show that the sensed or estimated side information reduces the rate regions, the same as that occurs for Costa Gaussian channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Asymptotic Capacity of Coordinated Multi-Point MIMO Channels with Spatial Correlation and LOS</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we focus on a general coordinated multi-point (CoMP) multiple input multiple-output (MIMO) system consisting of multiple users and multiple base stations (BSs) equipped with multiple antennas, respectively. An asymptotic ergodic mutual information expression and the capacity-achieving input covariance matrices for the system are derived employing novel techniques from large dimensional random matrix theory (RMT). The asymptotic regime is based on the assumption that the numbers of antennas at the transmitter and receiver approach to infinity with a fixed ratio. Our contributions are to extend the previous results to the general channel model with two-sided spatial correlation and line-of-sight (LOS), in which the transmit and receive correlation matrices are both generally nonnegative definite and the channel entries are non-Gaussian distributed. Simulations show that the asymptotic capacity is accurate even for finite number of antenna and invariant to all types of fading distribution.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Approaching Capacity of Large MIMO Systems by Non-Binary LDPC Codes and MMSE Detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we have investigated the application of non-binary LDPC codes to spatial multiplexing MIMO systems with a large number of low power antennas. We demonstrate that such large MIMO systems incorporating with low-complexity MMSE detector and non-binary LDPC codes can achieve low probability of bit error at near MIMO capacity. The new proposed non-binary LDPC coded system also performs better than other coded large MIMO systems known in the present literature. For instance, non-binary LDPC coded BPSK-MIMO system with 600 transmit/receive antennas performs within 3.4 dB from the capacity while the best known turbo coded system operates about 9.4 dB away from the capacity. Based on the simulation results provided in this paper, the proposed non-binary LDPC coded large MIMO system is capable of supporting ultra high spectral efficiency at low bit error rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Unitary Isotropically Distributed Inputs are not Capacity-Achieving for Large-MIMO Fading Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We analyze the capacity of Rayleigh block-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in the noncoherent setting and prove that unitary space-time modulation (USTM) is not capacity-achieving when the total number of antennas exceeds the coherence time of the fading channel. This situation is relevant for MIMO systems with large antenna arrays (large-MIMO systems). Our result settles a conjecture by Zheng &amp; Tse (2002) in the affirmative. The capacity-achieving input signal, which we refer to as Beta-variate space-time modulation (BSTM), turns out to be the product of a unitary isotropically distributed random matrix, and a diagonal matrix whose nonzero entries are distributed as the eigenvalues of a Beta-distributed random matrix of appropriate size. Numerical results illustrate that using BSTM instead of USTM in large-MIMO systems yields a rate gain as large as 13% for SNR values of practical interest.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Maximum Throughput and Expected-Rate in Multiple Transmit Antenna Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel is investigated in uncorrelated block fading environment with Rayleigh distribution. The maximum throughput and maximum expected-rate of this channel are obtained under the assumption that the transmitter is oblivious to the channel state information (CSI), however, the receiver has perfect CSI. First, we prove that the optimum transmission strategy maximizing the throughput is to use all available antennas and perform equal power allocation with uncorrelated signals. Furthermore, to increase the expected-rate, multi-layer coding is applied. Analogously, we establish that sending uncorrelated signals and performing equal power allocation across all available antennas at each layer is optimum. Finally, a closed form expression for the maximum continuous-layer expected-rate of MISO channels is also obtained.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Capacity Lower Bound of MIMO Channels with Output Quantization and Correlated Noise</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; We investigate the effect of quantization on the performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in terms of achievable communication rates. To this end, we derive a lower bound on the channel capacity of quantized MIMO channels based on the Bussgang decomposition. The work is of interest in the case when low resolution A/D-converters (ADCs) have to be used to enable higher sampling rate and to simplify the hardware. An essential aspect of our derivation is that we take into account possible noise correlation. The low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis of the special case of 1-bit quantization reveals that noise correlation might reduce the capacity loss due to quantization when compared to the uncorrelated noise case, where it is well known that the capacity decreases by the factor 2/pi after the 1-bit quantization at low SNR.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Max-Product Algorithm for Low Density Lattice Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A max-product algorithm for approximating maximum-likelihood lattice decoding of low density lattice codes is derived, operating directly in the Euclidean space. First we derive the max-product algorithm for continuous channels by taking a factor graph based approach. Then, for the additive white Gaussian noise channel we show the relation between the sum-product and max-product algorithms for low density lattice codes. In both algorithms the messages consist of the same Gaussians. While in the sum-product algorithm we sum the Gaussians in each message, for the max-product we take the maximal envelope of these Gaussians. Finally, we extend the parametric approach to efficiently implement the max-product algorithm, and show decrease in the word error rate (WER).</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An upper bound on the error probability of specific lattices, based on their distance spectrum, is constructed. The derivation is accomplished using a simple alternative to the Minkowski-Hlawka mean-value theorem of the geometry of numbers. In many ways, the new bound greatly resembles the Shulman-Feder bound for linear codes. Based on the new bound, an error exponent is derived for specific lattice sequences (of increasing dimension) over the AWGN channel. Measuring the sequence's gap to capacity, using the new exponent, is demonstrated.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Iterative Encoding with Gauss-Seidel method for Spatially-Coupled Low-Density Lattice Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>While it is known that spatially-coupled low-density lattice codes (SC-LDLC) have better decoding performance than conventional (non-coupled) LDLC lattices, in this paper it is shown that their encoding complexity is also lower. Since non-zero elements are mainly in lower triangular entries of the sparse inverse generator matrix of SC-LDLC, iterative encoding with the Gauss-Seidel method performs well. The convergence speed of iterative encoding is evaluated by both the mean square error (MSE) and the symbol error rate between a given integer vector and the inversely generated integer vector from the codeword of the given integer vector. Numerical experiments show that the convergence of encoding for SC-LDLC is 3 times faster than that of the conventional LDLC, at an MSE of 10 to the -10 for dimension n=10000.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimality of Linear Codes over PAM for the Modulo-Additive Gaussian Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>It has long been known that linear codes achieve the capacity of additive channels over finite fields. Much less has been known about the performance of linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_M$,when used for communication over channels that are additive with respect to this group.Further, linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_M$ play an important role in construction of lattices in Euclidean space. When a construction-A lattice is used for communication over an additive white Gaussian noise channel, a modulo-$M \mathbb{Z}$ additive channel with unimodal noise is induced at the receiver. In this paper it is shown that linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_M$ achieve the capacity of such channels when the cardinality of the alphabet is a power of a prime.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Secrecy Gain of Gaussian Wiretap Codes from 2- and 3-Modular Lattices</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Lattice coding over a Gaussian wiretap channel is considered with respect to a lattice invariant called the secrecy gain, which was introduced in [1] to characterize the confusion that a chosen lattice can cause at the eavesdropper: the higher the secrecy gain of the lattice, the more confusion. In this paper, secrecy gains of several 2- and 3-modular lattices are computed. Most are shown to have a secrecy gain larger than the best unimodular lattices can achieve.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Repairable Fountain Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We introduce a new family of fountain codes that are systematic and also have sparse parities. Although this is impossible if we require the code to be MDS, we show it can be achieved if we relax our requirement into a near-MDS property. More concretely, for any $\epsilon$ we construct codes that guarantee that a random subset of $(1+\epsilon)k$ symbols suffices to recover the original symbols with high probability. Our codes produce an unbounded number of output symbols by creating each parity independently by linearly combining a logarithmic number of input symbols. This structure has the additional benefit of logarithmic locality: a single symbol loss can be repaired by accessing only $O(\log k)$ other coded symbols. This is a desired property for distributed storage systems where symbols are spread over a network of storage nodes. Our mathematical contribution involves analyzing the rank of sparse random matrices over finite fields. We rely on establishing that a new family of sparse random bipartite graphs have large matchings with high probability.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Ripple Design of LT Codes for AWGN Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we present an analytical framework for LT codes in AWGN channels. It is very analogous to the original framework applied in designs for the binary erasure channel (BEC). We are able to show that some of the analytical results from the BEC also hold in AWGN channels. This enables us to apply the ripple based design approach, which until now has only been used in the BEC. LT Codes designed this way show very promising performance.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD Finite length LT codes over higher order Galois fields for unequal error protection (UEP) are analysed under maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. We consider a biased sampling method to create the LT code graph. In contrast to a previous approach by Rahnavard et. al., where a predetermined number of edges is created per importance class given a check node of degree d, our procedure allows to precisely adjust the desired class weights. Moreover, we provide upper and lower bounds on the symbol erasure probability for each importance class.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rateless Feedback Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a concept called rateless feedback coding.We redesign the existing LT codes and Raptor codes, by introducing new degree distributions with a certain amount of feedback opportunities. We show that adding feedback to LT codes can significantly decrease both the coding overhead and the encoding/decoding complexity. Moreover, we show that at the price of a slight increase in the coding overhead, linear complexity can be achieved with Raptor feedback coding.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Universal Rateless Coding with Finite Message Set</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Universal rateless coding over unknown discrete memoryless channels (DMC) with feedback is considered. In rateless codes each codeword is infinitely long, and the decoding time depends on the confidence level of the decoder. This work considers the finite message set case where a finite number of bits are transmitted over an unknown discrete memoryless channel, with a fix allowed error probability. Using rateless codes along with sequential universal decoding that utilizes a mixture probability laws instead of the unknown channel law, an optimal universal scheme is obtained. The analysis specifies explicitly the attainable rate, at each message set size and allowed error probability, which reflects the cost of universality.</abstract>

        <papertitle>One-Way Rate-Limited Sequential Key-Distillation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the problem of key-distillation for a source model, with a one-way and rate-limited public communication between two legitimate users. Although, the secret-key capacity is already known, we provide an alternative achievability scheme, that directly translates into practical designs. We consider a sequential key-distillation strategy, which consists of a reconciliation phase followed by a privacy amplification phase performed with extractors. We determine the reconciliation capacity and show that, for a degraded source, such a sequential strategy leads to an optimal key-distillation strategy that achieves the secret-key capacity. We illustrate our results in the case of a binary source model.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Agreement of a restricted secret key</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A secret key agreement problem is proposed with the additional restriction that the key is a function of a given secret source. An inner bound to the achievable rates, error and secrecy exponents is derived. The maximum key rate strongly achievable with positive exponents is characterized. The result leads to class of admissible restrictions on the key functions that does not diminish the strongly achievable key rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Fault-Tolerant Secret Key Generation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Mobile nodes observing correlated data communicate using an insecure bidirectional switch to generate a secret key, which remains concealed from the switch. We are interested in fault-tolerant secret key rates, i.e., the rates of secret keys that can be generated even if a subset of nodes drop out before the completion of the communication protocol. We formulate a new notion of fault-tolerant secret key capacity, and present an upper bound on it. This upper bound is shown to be tight when the underlying random variables are exchangeable. Further, it is shown that in this case one round of interaction suffices. The upper bound is also tight for the case of a pairwise independent network model consisting of a complete graph, and can be attained by a noninteractive protocol.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Connectivity Results for Sensor Networks Under a Random Pairwise Key Predistribution Scheme</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We investigate the connectivity of wireless sensor networks under the random pairwise key predistribution scheme of Chan et al. Under the assumption of full visibility this reduces to studying the connectivity in the so-called random K-out graph H(n;K); here n is the number of nodes and K&lt;n is an integer parameter affecting the number of keys stored at each node. We show that if K ≥ 2 (resp. K = 1), the probability that H(n; K ) is a connected graph approaches 1 (resp. 0) as n goes to infinity. This is done by establishing an explicitly computable lower bound on the probability of connectivity. Using this bound we see that the connectivity of the network can already be guaranteed (with K ≥ 2) by a relatively small number of sensors. This corrects earlier predictions made on the basis of a heuristic transfer of connectivity results for Erdos-Renyi graphs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Active Sensing in Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we consider a wideband cognitive radio network with limited available frame energy and treat a fundamental energy allocation problem: how available energy should be optimally allocated for sensing, probing, and data transmission to maximize the achievable average opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) throughput. By casting this problem into the multi-armed bandit framework under probably approximately correct learning, we put forth a proactive strategy for determining the optimal sensing cardinality and probing cardinality that maximize the average throughput of the secondary user. Numerical results show that our framework gives the the optimal diversity-energy tradeoff for the average OSA throughput.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Effect of Secondary Nodes on the Primary's Stable Throughput in a Cognitive Wireless Network</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a cognitive network consisting of one primary source-destination pair and N secondary cognitive source-destination pairs that randomly access the channel during the primary user's idle slots. Both cases of perfect and imperfect sensing are considered and we adopt the SINR threshold model for detection to properly model the interference between nodes. We first study the effect of the secondary nodes' transmission parameters such as power and channel access probabilities on the stable throughput of the primary node. In case of perfect sensing, secondary nodes' transmissions do not interfere with the primary and thus do not affect the primary's stable throughput. However, if the sensing is imperfect, secondary nodes may affect the primary stability because of their potential interference with the primary transmissions. It is shown that if the primary arrival rate is sufficiently low, the secondary nodes' transmissions do not affect the primary node's stability while if the primary arrival rate is high, the secondary nodes should regulate their transmission parameters to reduce the interference on the primary. Finally, we propose a multinode relaying protocol based on distributed space-time orthogonal block codes, that uses the secondary nodes as relays of the primary node's traffic to compensate for the interference they might cause. In this case, for appropriate modulation scheme and under perfect sensing, it is shown that the more secondary nodes in the system, the better for the primary user in terms of his stable throughput.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Capacity of the Semi-Deterministic Cognitive Interference Channel with a Common Cognitive Message and Approximate Capacity for the Gaussian Case</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper the study of the cognitive interference channel with a common message, a variation of the classical cognitive interference channel in which the cognitive message is decoded at both receivers. We derive the capacity for the semideterministic channel in which the output at the cognitive decoder is a deterministic function of the channel inputs. We also show capacity to within a constant gap and a constant factor for the Gaussian channel in which the outputs are linear combinations of the channel inputs plus an additive Gaussian noise term. Most of these results are shown using an interesting transmission scheme in which the cognitive message, decoded at both receivers, is also pre-coded against the interference experienced at the cognitive decoder. The pre-coding of the cognitive message does not allow the primary decoder to reconstruct the interfering signal. The cognitive message acts instead as a side information at the primary receiver when decoding its intended message.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper analyzes the capacity of a three-user interference channel with a cognitive transmitter which non-causally knows the messages of the other two transmitters. Especially, We derive the capacity region when all interference channel gains are strong and show that the capacity is achieved by superposition coding. From the capacity results for the specific channel conditions, we also analyze the capacity region for three-user Gaussian interference channel with a cognitive transmitter.</abstract>

The two transmitters jointly send one message to receivers 1 and 2, and transmitter 2 also sends a separate message to receiver 2. The channel outputs at the two receivers are corrupted by an identical independent distributed(i.i.d.)\ Gaussian distributed state sequences and Gaussian noise variables. The state sequence is noncausally known at transmitter 2 only. The Gaussian channels are partitioned into two classes based on channel parameters. For each class, the inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived, and either the capacity region or partial boundaries of the capacity region are characterized for all Gaussian channels. The cognitive interference channel with state known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2 is further studied, and the capacity region is established for a class of channels, which is shown to be achieved by certain cases of Gaussian channels with state known only at transmitter 2 noncausally.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Compressive Binary Search</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we consider the problem of locating a nonzero entry in a high-dimensional vector from possibly adaptive linear measurements. We consider a recursive bisection method which we dub the compressive binary search and show that it improves on what any nonadaptive method can achieve. We also establish a nonasymptotic lower bound that applies to all methods, regardless of their computational complexity. Combined, these results show that the compressive binary search is within a double logarithmic factor of the optimal performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Adaptive Group Testing as Channel Coding with Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Group testing is the combinatorial problem of identifying the defective items in a population by grouping items into test pools. Recently, nonadaptive group testing - where all the test pools must be decided on at the start - has been studied from an information theory point of view. Using techniques from channel coding, upper and lower bounds have been given on the number of tests required to accurately recover the defective set, even when the test outcomes can be noisy.&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, we give the first information theoretic result on adaptive group testing - where the outcome of previous tests can influence the makeup of future tests. We show that adaptive testing does not help much, as the number of tests required obeys the same lower bound as nonadaptive testing. Our proof uses similar techniques to the proof that feedback does not improve channel capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Non-adaptive Group Testing: Explicit bounds and novel algorithms</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We present computationally efficient and provably correct algorithms with near-optimal sample-complexity for noisy non-adaptive group testing. Group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of items into pools. Each pool is then tested to identify the defective items, which are usually assumed to be sparse. We consider random non-adaptive pooling where pools are selected randomly and independently of the test outcomes. Our noisy scenario accounts for both false negatives and false positives for the test outcomes. Inspired by compressive sensing algorithms we introduce three novel computationally efficient decoding algorithms for group testing, CBP via Linear Programming (CBP-LP), NCBP-LP (Noisy CBP-LP), and SNCBP-LP (``Simple&quot; NCBP-LP). The first of these algorithms deals with the noiseless measurement scenario, and the next two with the noisy measurement scenario. We derive explicit sample-complexity bounds---with all constants made explicit---for these algorithms as a function of the desired error probability; the noise parameters; the number of items; and the size of the defective set (or an upper bound on it). We show that the sample-complexities of our algorithms are near-optimal with respect to known information-theoretic bounds.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Adaptive sensing using deterministic partial Hadamard matrices</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper investigates the construction of deterministic measurement matrices preserving the entropy of a random vector with a given probability distribution. In particular, it is shown that for a random vector having i.i.d. discrete components, this is achieved by selecting a subset of rows of a Hadamard matrix such that (i) the selection is deterministic (ii) the fraction of selected rows is vanishing. In contrast, it is shown that for a random vector with i.i.d. continuous components, no entropy preserving measurement matrix allows dimensionality reduction. These results are in agreement with the results of Wu-Verdu on almost lossless analog compression. This paper is however motivated by the complexity attribute of Hadamard matrices, which allows the use of efficient and stable reconstruction algorithms. The proof technique is based on a polar code martingale argument and on a new entropy power inequality for integer-valued random variables.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Semi-Quantitative Group Testing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a novel group testing procedure, termed semi-quantitative group testing, motivated by a class of problems arising in genome sequence processing. Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a non-binary pooling scheme that may be viewed as a combination of an adder model followed by a quantizer. For the new testing scheme we define the capacity, and evaluate some special cases using information theoretic methods. We also define a new class of disjunct codes suitable for SQGT dubbed SQ-disjunct. Based on this new family of codes, we provide both explicit and probabilistic code constructions for SQGT with simple decoding algorithms.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Beyond Worst-Case Reconstruction in Deterministic Compressed Sensing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The role of random measurement in compressive sensing is analogous to the role of random codes in coding theory. In coding theory, decoders that can correct beyond the minimum distance of a code allow random codes to achieve the Shannon limit. In compressed sensing, the counterpart of minimum distance is the spark of the measurement matrix, that is the size of the smallest set of linearly dependent columns. This paper constructs a family of measurement matrices where the columns are formed by exponentiating codewords from a classical binary error-correcting code of block length $M$. The columns can be partitioned into mutually unbiased bases, and the spark of the corresponding measurement matrix is shown to be of the order $\sqrt{M}$ by identifying a configuration of columns that plays a role similar to that of the Dirac comb in classical Fourier analysis. Further, an explicit basis for the null space of these measurement matrices is given in terms of indicator functions of binary self-dual codes. Reliable reconstruction of $k$-sparse inputs is shown for $k$ of order $M / \log(M)$ which is best possible and far beyond the worst case lower bound provided by the spark.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Minimum Complexity Pursuit: Stability Analysis</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A host of problems involve the recovery of structured signals from a dimensionality reduced representation such as a random projection; examples include sparse signals (compressive sensing) and low-rank matrices (matrix completion). Given the wide range of different recovery algorithms developed to date, it is natural to ask whether there exist &quot;universal&quot; algorithms for recovering &quot;structured&quot; signals from their linear projections. We recently answered this question in the affirmative in the noise-free setting. In this paper, we extend our results to the case of noisy measurements.</abstract>

        <papertitle>1-bit Hamming Compressed Sensing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Compressed sensing (CS) and 1-bit CS cannot directly recover quantized signals preferred in digital systems and require time consuming recovery. In this paper, we introduce 1-bit \textit{Hamming compressed sensing} (HCS) that directly recovers a k-bit quantized signal of dimensional $n$ from its 1-bit measurements via invoking $n$ times of Kullback-Leibler divergence based nearest neighbor search. Compared to CS and 1-bit CS, 1-bit HCS allows the signal to be dense, takes considerably less (linear) recovery time and requires substantially less measurements. Moreover, 1-bit HCS recovery can accelerate the subsequent 1-bit CS dequantizer. We study a quantized recovery error bound of 1-bit HCS for general signals. Extensive numerical simulations verify the appealing accuracy, robustness, efficiency and consistency of 1-bit HCS.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Binary Graphs and Message Passing Strategies for Compressed Sensing in the Noiseless Setting</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We propose a scheme for Compressed Sensing in the noiseless setting that reconstructs the original signal operating on a binary graph where the samples are obtained sequentially. The proposed scheme has an affordable computational complexity and a large performance enhancement with respect to similar schemes in the literature, thanks to the proposed measurement matrix structure and enhanced decoding based on a message passing algorithm.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Analysis and Design of Irregular Graphs for Node-Based Verification-Based Recovery Algorithms in Compressed Sensing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we present a probabilistic analysis of iterative node-based verification-based (NB-VB) recovery algorithms over irregular graphs in the context of compressed sensing. Verification-based algorithms are particularly interesting due to their low complexity (linear in the signal dimension $n$). The analysis predicts the average fraction of unverified signal elements at each iteration $\ell$ where the average is taken over the ensembles of input signals and sensing matrices. The analysis is asymptotic ($n \rightarrow \infty$) and is similar in nature to the well-known density evolution technique commonly used to analyze iterative decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing technique for the analysis of NB-VB algorithms, which is based on numerically solving a large system of coupled differential equations, the proposed method is much simpler and more accurate. This allows us to design irregular sensing graphs for such recovery algorithms. The designed irregular graphs outperform the corresponding regular graphs substantially. For example, for the same recovery complexity per iteration, we design irregular graphs that can recover up to about $40\%$ more non-zero signal elements compared to the regular graphs. Simulation results are also provided which demonstrate that the proposed asymptotic analysis matches the performance of recovery algorithms for large but finite values of $n$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Space Information Flow: Multiple Unicast</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The multiple unicast network coding conjecture states that for multiple unicast in an undirected network, network coding is equivalent to routing. Simple and intuitive as it is, the conjecture has remained open since its proposal in 2004, and is now a well-known unsolved problem in the field of network coding. In this work, we provide a proof to the conjecture in its space/geometric version. Space information flow is a new paradigm being proposed. It studies the transmission of information in a geometric space, where information flows are free to propagate along any trajectories, and may be encoded wherever they meet. The goal is to minimize a natural bandwidth-distance sum-product (network volume), while sustaining end-to-end unicast and multicast communication demands among terminals at known coordinates. The conjecture is true in networks only if it is true in space. Our main result is that network coding is indeed equivalent to routing in the space model. Besides its own merit, this partially verifies the original conjecture, and further leads to a geometric frameworkfor a hopeful proof to the conjecture.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Transform Approach to Linear Network Coding for Acyclic Networks with Delay</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; The algebraic formulation for linear network coding in acyclic networks with the links having integer delay is well known. Based on this formulation, for a given set of connections over an arbitrary acyclic network with integer delay assumed for the links, the output symbols at the sink nodes at any given time instant is a $\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear combination of the input symbols across different generations, where $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ denotes the field over which the network operates. We use finite-field discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to convert the output symbols at the sink nodes at any given time instant into a $\mathbb{F}_{q}$-linear combination of the input symbols generated during the same generation. We call this as transforming the acyclic network with delay into {\em $n$-instantaneous networks} ($n$ is sufficiently large). We show that under certain conditions, there exists a network code satisfying sink demands in the usual (non-transform) approach if and only if there exists a network code satisfying sink demands in the transform approach. Furthermore, assuming {\em time invariant} local encoding kernels, we show that the transform method can be employed to achieve half the rate corresponding to the individual source-destination min-cut (which are assumed to be equal to $1$) for some classes of three-source three-destination multiple unicast network with delays using alignment strategies when the zero-interference condition is not satisfied.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Feasibility of Precoding-Based Network Alignment for Three Unicast Sessions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of network coding across three unicast sessions over a directed acyclic graph, when each session has min-cut one. Previous work by Das et al. adapted a precoding-based interference alignment technique, originally developed for the wireless interference channel, specifically to this problem. We refer to this approach as precoding-based network alignment (PBNA). Similar to the wireless setting, PBNA asymptotically achieves half the minimum cut; different from the wireless setting, its feasibility depends on the graph structure. Das et al. provided a set of feasibility conditions for PBNA with respect to a particular precoding matrix. However, the set consisted of an infinite number of conditions, which is impossible to check in practice. Furthermore, the conditions were purely algebraic, without interpretation with regards to the graph structure. In this paper, we first prove that the set of conditions provided by Das. et al are also necessary for the feasibility of PBNA with respect to any precoding matrix. Then, using two graph-related properties and a degree-counting technique, we reduce the set to just four conditions. This reduction enables an efficient algorithm for checking the feasibility of PBNA on a given graph.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Network Coding for Two-Unicast with Rate (1,2)</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a directed acyclic network with two source-sink pairs $\{s_1,t_1\}$ and $\{s_2,t_2\}$. The source $s_1$ wishes to communicate a message $X_1$ to the sink $t_1$ and the source $s_2$ wishes to communicate two messages $X_2$ and $X_3$ to the sink $t_2$, where $X_i, i=1,2,3,$ are independent random variables of unit rate. We give a simple characterization for linear solvability of such networks under the condition that the minimum cut from $\{s_1, s_2\}$ to $t_2$ equals $3$. We develop a region decomposition method for proving this result, which we believe can be an effective approach for non-multicast network coding problem.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On X-Channels with Feedback and Delayed CSI</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of the two-user MIMO X-channel is characterized in the presence of output feedback and delayed channel state information (CSI). The number of antennas at each transmitters is assumed to be M and the number of antennas at each of the receivers is assumed to be $N$. It is shown that the sum DoF of the two-user MIMO X-channel is the same as the sum DoF of a two-user MIMO broadcast channel with 2M transmit antennas, and N antennas at each receiver. Hence, for this symmetric antenna configuration, there is no performance loss in the sum degrees of freedom due to the distributed nature of the transmitters. This result highlights the usefulness of feedback and delayed CSI for the MIMO X-channel.&#13;
&#13;
The K-user X-channel with single antenna at each transmitter and each receiver is also studied. In this network, each transmitter has a message intended for each receiver. For this network, it is shown that the sum DoF with partial output feedback alone is at least 2K/(K+1). This lower bound is strictly better than the best lower bound known for the case of delayed CSI assumption for all values of K.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. In this paper, we study the capacity region of the two-user binary fading interference channel with delayed network state information at the transmitters and noiseless output feedback links from each receiver to its corresponding transmitter. Our results include a new achievability strategy that systematically utilizes the stale network state information and the previously received signals at the receivers, in order to enhance the achievable rate region. We also derive new outer-bounds on the capacity region of such network, and we show that the delay in learning network state information results in some loss in the capacity region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Interference Alignment for Achieving both Full DOF and Full Diversity in the Broadcast Channel with Delayed CSIT</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Maddah-Ali and Tse have recently shown that delayed transmitter channel state information (CSIT) can still be useful in increasing the number of degree-of-freedom (DOF) in the MIMO broadcast channel, by constructing a scheme that, in the presence of two transmit antennas, and two single-antenna receivers, manages to achieve 4/3 DOF despite the fact that CSIT is stale by one coherence time. This same scheme though achieves these gains in DOF, but suppressing the inherent diversity of the broadcast parallel channel. The current work proposes a novel broadcast scheme which, over the above described setting, employs a form of interference alignment to achieve both full DOF as well as full diversity.</abstract>

        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian X channel in i.i.d. fading environment and with delayed channel state information at transmitters (delayed CSIT) is considered. It is assumed that each transmitter has M antennas and each receiver has N antennas. New achievable results on the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of this channel are provided and shown to be tight for all possible values of M and N except for 1/2 &lt; N/M &lt; 4/3.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Random Access in Wireless X Networks: A Deterministic View</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; We study a 2-user symmetric X channel with random access capability for transmitters from a deterministic point of view. Transmitters can work in two modes of operation independent of each other, either active or inactive. There is an independent message from each transmitter to each receiver. It is aimed in this study at maximizing the throughput of this network over the set of rates which can be reliably communicated. To characterize this rate region, an information theoretic outerbound is derived. Achievability is based on opportunistic signal transmission along with a linear pre-coding scheme. Once the rate region is exactly determined, throughput maximization can be solved as a linear programming problem.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Deterministic Approach to Random Access Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; A random access interference channel in which transmitters are active with a certain probability is considered. By adopting the deterministic channel model, the optimum transmission strategy which yields the maximum achievable expected sum-rate, or channel throughput, is characterized for the symmetric case. The optimal transmission strategy achieves the sum capacity of the deterministic interference channel when both users are active, and opportunistically increases the expected sum-rate when transmitters may not always be active.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Carry-free Models and Beyond</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The generalized deterministic models recently proposed by Niesen and Maddah-Ali successfully capture real- interference alignment as observed in Gaussian models. Simpler deterministic models, like ADT models, cannot demonstrate this phenomenon because they are limited in the set of channel gains they can model. This paper reinterprets the Niesen and Maddah-Ali models through the lens of carry-free operations. We further explore these carry-free models by considering i.i.d. unknown fading networks. In the unknown fading context, a carry-free model can be further simplified to a max-superposition model, where signals are superposed by a nonlinear max operation. Unlike in relay-networks with known fading and linear superposition, we find that decode-and-forward can perform arbitrarily better than compress-and-forward in max-superposition relay networks with unknown fading.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Expansion Coding: Achieving the Capacity of an AEN Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A general method of coding over expansions is proposed, which allows one to reduce the highly non-trivial problem of coding over continuous channels to a much simpler discrete ones. More specifically, the focus is on the additive exponential noise (AEN) channel, for which the (binary) expansion of the (exponential) noise random variable is considered. It is shown that each of the random variables in the expansion corresponds to independent Bernoulli random variables. Thus, each of the expansion levels (of the underlying channel) corresponds to a binary symmetric channel (BSC), and the coding problem is reduced to coding over these parallel channels while satisfying the channel input constraint. This optimization formulation is stated as the achievable rate result, for which a specific choice of input distribution is shown to achieve a rate which is arbitrarily close to the channel capacity in the high SNR regime. Remarkably, the scheme allows for low-complexity capacity-achieving codes for AEN channels, using the codes that are originally designed for BSCs. Extensions to different channel models and applications to other coding problems are discussed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Joint Source-Channel Coding for the Multiple-Access Relay Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Reliable transmission of arbitrarily correlated sources over multiple-access relay channels (MARCs) and multiple-access broadcast relay channels (MABRCs) is considered. In MARCs only the destination is interested in a reconstruction of the sources, while in MABRCs both the relay and the destination want to reconstruct the sources. In addition to arbitrary correlation among the sources at the transmitters, both the relay and the destination have side information that is correlated with the sources. Two joint source-channel coding schemes are presented and the corresponding sets of sufficient conditions for reliable communication are derived. The proposed schemes use a combination of the correlation preserving mapping technique (CPM) with binning: the first scheme uses CPM for encoding information to the relay and binning for encoding information to the destination; while the second scheme uses binning for encoding information to the relay and CPM for encoding information to the destination.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Source Transmission over Some Classes of Relay Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the reliable transmission of correlated sources over the relay channel. One of the sources is available at the sender while the other one is known to the relay. The receiver wishes to reconstruct both sources. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal separation of source and channel codes. The coding scheme is based on the combination of the Slepian-Wolf source coding and Partial Decode-and-Forward (PDF) strategy. In this scheme, the relay partially decodes the message transmitted by the sender. We also consider the semideterministic relay channel where the output at the relay is a deterministic function of inputs from the sender and the relay. For the transmission of a single source over the semideterministic relay channel with correlated side information at the relay, the proposed conditions coincide.We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for the transmission of sources over the degraded relay channel where the output at the receiver is a degraded version of the output at the relay.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lossy Source-Channel Communication over a Phase-Incoherent Interference Relay Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the lossy communication of a bivariate Gaussian source over an interference channel with the presence of a helping relay. We assume that the wireless links introduce random phase shifts which are unknown to the transmitters (including the relay) and call the channel a phase incoherent interference relay channel (PI-IRC). We derive inner and outer bounds for the achievable distortion region, where the inner bound is derived under specific strong interference conditions as well as strong gain conditions between transmitters and the relay. When the sources are correlated, we find an approximate achievable distortion region in the high SNR regime. In case of independent sources, the bounds are tight and by explicitly providing the achievable distortion region, we show that a separation theorem results for the PI-IRC under strong interference conditions. By removing the relay, the result also specializes to an interference channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Joint Source-Channel Coding for Cribbing Models</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work we study problems of joint source-channel coding for the multiple access channel with cribbing encoders. Three scenarios are considered in this work: (i) the symmetric model, where both encoders crib strictly causally at each other's output, (ii) the model where encoder 1 cribs strictly causally at the output of encoder 2, and encoder 2 cribs causally at the output of encoder 1, and (iii) the model where only one encoder cribs, in a non-causal manner. For the symmetric case, model (i), sufficient conditions are derived for lossless transmission of a correlated pair source $(U,V)$ via the multiple access channel (MAC). For the non-symmetric scenarios (ii) and (iii), necessary and sufficient conditions are derived, for transmissibilty of the pair source via the MAC. The main focus of this work is on lossless transmission, however, for case (iii) we allow distortion in one of the source components.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Universal Bounds on the Scaling Behavior of Polar Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We consider the problem of determining the trade-off between the rate and the block-length of polar codes for a given block error probability when we use the successive cancellation decoder. We take the sum of the Bhattacharyya parameters as a proxy for the block error probability, and show that there exists a universal parameter $\mu \approx 3$ such that for any binary memoryless symmetric channel $W$ with capacity $I(W)$, reliable communication requires rates that satisfy $R&lt; I(W)-\alpha N^{-\frac{1}{\mu}}$, where $\alpha$ is a positive constant and $N$ is the block-length.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Polar Codes: Robustness of the Successive Cancellation Decoder with Respect to Quantization</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Polar codes provably achieve the capacity of a wide array of channels under successive decoding. This assumes infinite precision arithmetic. Given the successive nature of the decoding algorithm, one might worry about the sensitivity of the performance to the precision of the computation.&#13;
&#13;
We show that even very coarsely quantized decoding algorithms can lead to excellent performance. More concretely, we show that under successive decoding with an alphabet of cardinality only three, the decoder still has a threshold and this threshold is a sizable fraction of capacity. More generally, we show that if we are willing to transmit at a rate $\delta$ below capacity, then we need only $c \log(1/\delta)$ bits of precision, where $c$ is a universal constant.

        <papertitle>Code Based Efficient Maximum-Likelihood Decoding of Short Polar Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Polar codes are known as the first provable code construction to achieve Shannon capacity for arbitrary symmetric binary-input channels. Although, there exist efficient sub-optimal decoders with reduced complexity for polar codes, the complexity of the optimum ML decoder increases exponentially. Hence the optimum decoder is infeasible for the practical implementation of polar coding. In this paper, our motivation is about developing efficient ML decoder with reduced complexity. In this purpose, polar code based sphere decoding algorithm is proposed with the optimal performance. Additionally, proposed technique exploits two properties of polar coding to reduce decoding complexity. By this way, the reduced complexity of optimal decoding is only cubic, not exponential.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Polar write once memory codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A coding scheme for write once memory (WOM) using polar codes is presented. It is shown that the scheme achieves the capacity region of noiseless WOMs when an arbitrary number of multiple writes is permitted. The encoding and decoding complexities scale as O(N log N) where N is the blocklength. For N sufficiently large, the error probability decreases sub-exponentially in N. Some simulation results with finite length codes are presented.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Efficient code-based one-time signature from automorphism groups with syndrome compatibility</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we propose a new one-time signature algorithm based on coding theory. The algorithm uses properties of automorphism group of certain codes to dramatically decrease the size of the public key of the scheme. By considering the action of cyclic shifts or the action of the group PSL2(p) we obtain public keys of less than 17 kilobits for a signature of 7 kilobits. Overall the scheme we propose is perfectly fitted to be used with Merkle tree and proposes a very good trade-off between size of key and size of signatures compared to other code-based signature schemes, with multi-time signatures of size 28kb.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Efficient Signature Scheme for Network Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Network coding helps maximize the network throughput. However, such schemes are also vulnerable to pollution attacks in which malicious forwarders inject polluted messages into the system. Traditional cryptographic solution, such as digital signatures, are not suited for network coding, in which nodes do not forward the original packets, but rather linear combinations of the data they received. We describe secure scheme that uses batch techniques and selective verification to efficiently verify the integrity of the received packets. We show that for real peer-to-peer networks, our scheme is much more efficient than previously suggested schemes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>BPRS: Belief Propagation Based Iterative Recommender System</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We formulate the recommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal probability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be predicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is computationally prohibitive for largescale systems. Therefore, we utilize the BP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each active user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As opposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving the recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset), we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of the users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to the state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision accuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Convergence of Generalized Linear Coordinate-Descent Message-Passing for Quadratic Optimization</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the generalized linear coordinate-descent (GLiCD) algorithm for the quadratic optimization problem. As an extension of the linear coordinate-descent (LiCD) algorithm, the GLiCD algorithm incorporates feedback from last iteration in generating new messages. We show that if the amount of feedback signal from last iteration is set be above a threshold and the GLiCD algorithm converges, it computes the optimal solution. Based on the result, we further show that if the feedback signal is large enough, the GLiCD algorithm is guaranteed to converge.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Relaxed Gaussian Belief Propagation</papertitle>

        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot;&#13;
&#13;
The Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP) algorithm executed on Gaussian Markov Random Fields can take a large number of iterations to converge if the precision matrix is ill-conditioned and weakly diagonally dominant. Such matrices can arise from many practical problem domains. In this study, we propose a relaxed GaBP algorithm that demonstrates a reduction in the number of GaBP iterations (of up to 12.7 times). We also propose a second relaxed algorithm that avoids the need of determining the relaxation factor a priori which can achieve significant iteration reductions using heuristic measures. We illustrate a case for ill-conditioned weakly diagonally dominant precision matrices, where the new relaxed GaBP algorithm can be implemented without any significant increase, over the original GaBP, in both the computational complexity and the memory requirements.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Message-passing sequential detection of multiple change points in networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We propose a probabilistic formulation that enables sequential detection of multiple change points in a network setting. We present a class of sequential detection rules for functionals of change points, and prove their asymptotic optimality properties in terms of expected detection delay time. Drawing from graphical model formalism, the sequential detection rules can be implemented by a computationally efficient message-passing protocol which may scale up linearly in network size and in waiting time. The effectiveness of our exact and approximate inference algorithms are demonstrated by simulations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Bethe Approximation of the Pattern Maximum Likelihood Distribution</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Among all memoryless source distributions, the pattern maximum likelihood (PML) distribution is the distribution which maximizes the probability that a memoryless source produces a string with a given pattern. Equivalently, the PML distribution maximizes the permanent of a certain non-negative matrix. We reformulate this maximization problem as a double minimization problem of a suitable Gibbs free energy function. Because finding the minimum of this function appears intractable for practically relevant problem sizes, one must look for tractable approximations.&#13;
&#13;
 One approach is to approximately find a minimum (or at least a local minimum) of the Gibbs free energy function by applying an alternating minimization algorithm where the steps are based on quantities that are obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. One can show that this approach is equivalent to an algorithm that was proposed by Orlitsky et al.&#13;
&#13;
 An alternative approach is to replace the Gibbs free energy function by a tractable approximation like the Bethe free energy function and to apply an alternating minimization algorithm to this function. As it turns out, empirically, this latter approach gives very good approximations to the PML distribution (or at least a locally optimal PML distribution), and, for the same level of accuracy, is two to three orders of magnitude faster than the former approach for practically relevant problem sizes.&#13;
&#13;
 Moreover, the above free energy framework allows us to simplify some earlier proofs of properties of the PML distribution and to derive some new properties of the PML distribution, along with obtaining similar results for its Bethe approximation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Alternating Markov Chains for Distribution Estimation in the Presence of Errors</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a class of small sample distribution estimators over noisy channels. Our estimators are designed for repetition channels, and rely on properties of the runs of the observed sequences. These runs are modeled via a special type of Markov chains, termed alternating Markov chains. We show that alternating chains have redundancy that scales sub-linearly with the lengths of the sequences, and describe how to use a distribution estimator for alternating chains for the purpose of distribution estimation over repetition channels.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On simple one-class classification methods</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The one-class classification has been successfully applied in many communication, signal processing, and machine learning tasks. This problem, as defined by the one-class SVM approach, consists in identifying a sphere enclosing all (or the most) of the data. The classical strategy to solve the problem considers a simultaneous estimation of both the center and the radius of the sphere. In this paper, we study the impact of separating the estimation problem. It turns out that simple one-class classification methods can be easily derived, by considering a least-squares formulation. The proposed framework allows us to derive some theoretical results, such as an upper bound on the probability of false detection. The relevance of this work is illustrated on well-known datasets.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Optimal Two Sample Homogeneity Tests for Finite Alphabets</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Suppose we are given two independent strings of data from a known finite alphabet. We are interested in testing the null hypothesis that both the strings were drawn from the same distribution, assuming that the samples within each string are mutually independent. Among statisticians, the most popular solution for such a \emph{homogeneity test} is the two sample chi-square test, primarily due to its ease of implementation and the fact that the limiting null hypothesis distribution of the associated test statistic is known and easy to compute. Although tests that are asymptotically optimal in error probability have been proposed in the information theory literature, such optimality results are not well-known and such tests are rarely used in practice. In this paper we seek to bridge the gap between theory and practice. We study two different optimal tests proposed by Shayevitz \cite{sha11} and Gutman \cite{gut89}. We first obtain a simplified structure of Shayevitz's test and then obtain limiting distributions of the test statistics used in both the tests. These results provide guidelines for choosing thresholds that guarantee an approximate false alarm constraint for finite length observation sequences, thus making these tests easy to use in practice. The approximation accuracies are demonstrated using simulations. We argue that such homogeneity tests with provable optimality properties could potentially be better choices than the chi-square test in practice.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Recovery Threshold for Optimal Weight l1 Minimization</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of recovering a sparse signal from underdetermined measurements when we have prior information about the sparsity structure of the signal. In particular, we assume that the support of the signal can be partitioned into two known sets S1, S2 where the relative sparsities over the two sets are different. In this situation it is advantageous to replace classical l1 minimization with weighted l1 minimization, where the denser support is given a larger weight. Prior work has analyzed the minimum number of measurements required for signal recovery with high probability as a function of the sizes of S1, S2, the sparsity levels and the weights. Numerical methods have also been devised to find the optimal weights. In this paper we give a simple closed form expression for the minimum number of measurements required for successful recovery when the optimal weights are chosen. The formula shows that the number of measurements is equal to the sum of the minimum number of measurements needed had we measured the S1 and S2 components of the signal separately. Our proof technique uses an escape through mesh framework and connects to the MMSE of a certain basis pursuit denoising problem.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The l1 Analysis Approach by Sparse Dual Frames for Sparse Signal Recovery Represented by Frames</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A sparse-dual-frame based $\ell_1$-analysis approach for compressed sensing (CS) is proposed. Sparse dual frame is a notion of optimal dual frames of a non-exact frame. It is motivated in the study of compressed sensing problems where signals are sparse with respect to redundant dictionaries (frames). An alternating iterative algorithm is proposed. An error bound ensuring the correct signal recovery is obtained. Empirical studies show that the new sparse-dual-based approach provides satisfactory solutions, whereas other existing means do not, over generally very difficult CS problems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Performance Analysis of l1-synthesis with Coherent Frames</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; Signals with sparse representations in frames comprise a much more realistic model of nature, it is therefore highly desirable to extend the compressed sensing methodology to redundant dictionaries (or frames) as opposed to orthonormal bases only. In the generalized setting, the standard approach to recover the signal is known as $\ell_1$-synthesis (or Basis Pursuit). In this paper, we present the performance analysis of this approach in which the dictionary may be highly - and even perfectly - correlated. Our results do not depend on an accurate recovery of the coefficients. We demonstrate the validity of the results via several experiments.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Sparse Signal Separation in Redundant Dictionaries</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We formulate a unified framework for the separation of signals that are sparse in &quot;morphologically&quot; different redundant dictionaries. This formulation incorporates the so-called &quot;analysis&quot; and &quot;synthesis&quot; approaches as special cases and contains novel hybrid setups. We find corresponding coherence-based recovery guarantees for an l1-norm based separation algorithm. Our results recover those reported in Studer and Baraniuk, ACHA, submitted, for the synthesis setting, provide new recovery guarantees for the analysis setting, and form a basis for comparing performance in the analysis and synthesis settings. As an aside our findings complement the D-RIP recovery results reported in Candès et al., ACHA, 2011, for the &quot;analysis&quot; signal recovery problem: minimize_x ||Ψx||_1 subject to ||y - Ax||_2 ≤ ε, by delivering corresponding coherence-based recovery results.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Analog Network Coding in General SNR Regime</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of maximum rate achievable with analog network coding for a unicast communication over a layered wireless relay network with directed links is considered. A relay node performing analog network coding scales and forwards the signals received at its input. Recently this problem has been considered under two assumptions: (A) each relay node scales its received signal to the upper bound of its transmit power constraint, (B) the relay nodes in specific subsets of the network operate in the high-SNR regime. We establish that assumption (A), in general, leads to suboptimal end-to-end rate. We also characterize the performance of analog network coding in a class of symmetric layered networks without assumption (B).&#13;
&#13;
The key contribution of this work is a lemma that states that in a layered relay network a globally optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes that maximizes the end-to-end rate can be computed layer-by-layer. Specifically, a rate-optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes in a layer is the one that maximizes the sum-rate of the nodes in the next layer. This critical insight allows us to characterize analog network coding performance in network scenarios beyond those that can be analyzed using the existing approaches. We illustrate this by computing the maximum rate achievable with analog network coding in one particular layered network, in various communication scenarios.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Network Coding for the Broadcast Rayleigh Fading Channel with Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A broadcast system with ACK/NAK feedback is considered where each link is modeled as a Rayleigh fading channel. The performance improvement is investigated if the erroneously received packets are not discarded and the soft information within them is exploited to reduce the number of transmission attempts. An outer bound on the packet reception rate region on the physical layer is provided by extending that region on the packet layer. A new transmission algorithm is proposed that combines log-likelihood ratios on the physical layer with network coding. This transmission algorithm does not require the transmitter to know any prior or instantaneous information about the channel and considers network coding on both the packet layer and the physical layer. Simulations show that the transmission algorithm with soft decoding achieves rates close to an outer bound for the packet reception rate region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Linear Network Coding Capacity Region of 2-Receiver MIMO Broadcast Packet Erasure Channels with Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This work studies the capacity of the 2-receiver multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast packet erasure channels (PECs) with channel output feedback, which is in contrast with the single-input/single-output setting of the existing works. Motivated by the immense success of linear network coding (LNC) in theory and in practice, this work focuses exclusively on LNC schemes and characterizes the LNC feedback capacity region (R_1^*,R_2^*) of 2-receiver MIMO broadcast PECs. A new linear-space-based approach is proposed, which unifies the problems of finding a capacity outer bound and devising the achievability scheme into a single linear programming (LP) problem. Specifically, an LP solver is used to exhaustively search for the LNC scheme(s) with the best possible throughput, the result of which is thus guaranteed to attain the LNC feedback capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless Network Coding for MIMO Two-way Relaying using Latin Rectangles</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The design of modulation schemes for the physical layer network-coded two-way MIMO relaying scenario is considered, with the denoise-and-forward (DNF) protocol which employs two phases: Multiple access (MA) phase and Broadcast (BC) phase. It is shown that for MIMO two-way relaying, deep fade occurs at the relay when the row space of the channel fade coefficient matrix is a subspace of a finite number of vector subspaces which are referred to as the singular fade subspaces. It is shown that proper choice of network coding map obtained by the completion of appropriate partially filled Latin Rectangle can remove most of the singular fade subspaces, referred to as the removable singular fade subspaces. For $2^{\lambda}$-PSK signal set, the number of removable and non-removable singular fade subspaces are obtained analytically and it is shown that the number of non-removable singular fade subspaces is a small fraction of the total number of singular fade subspaces. The Latin Rectangles for the case when the end nodes use different number of antennas are shown to be obtainable from the Latin Squares for the case when they use the same number of antennas, irrespective of the value of $n_R$. For $2^{\lambda}$-PSK signal set, the singular fade subspaces which are removed by the conventional XOR network code are identified. Also, using the notions of isotopic and transposed Latin Squares, the network coding maps which remove all the removable singular singular fade subspaces are shown to be obtainable from a small set of Latin Squares.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Approximate Sum Capacity of the Symmetric Gaussian K-User Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We derive a new achievable sum rate for the symmetric Gaussian K-user interference channel. This sum rate is shown to be within a constant gap of the outer bound on the sum capacity of this channel for all values of interference level outside some outage set. The result is established through the use of lattice interference alignment. A new lattice-based extension to the Han-Kobayshi scheme is also introduced.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Interference Alignment: From Degrees-of-Freedom to Constant-Gap Capacity Approximations</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Interference alignment is a key technique for communication scenarios with multiple interfering links. In several such scenarios, interference alignment was used to characterize the degrees-of-freedom of the channel. However, these degrees-of-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak to make accurate predictions about the behavior of channel capacity at finite signal-to-noise ratios. The aim of this paper is to significantly strengthen these results by showing that interference alignment can be used to characterize capacity to within a constant gap. We focus on real time-invariant frequency-flat X-channels, for which only the degrees-of-freedom are known. We propose a new communication scheme and show that it achieves the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To aid in this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel model, admitting a wider range of achievable schemes that can be translated to the Gaussian channel. For this deterministic model, we find an approximately optimal communication scheme. We then translate this scheme for the deterministic channel to the original Gaussian X-channel and show that it achieves capacity to within a constant gap.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Degrees of Freedom of MIMO X Networks: Spatial Scale Invariance, One-Sided Decomposability and Linear Feasibility</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We show that an M x N user MIMO X network with A antennas at each node has AMN/(M+N-1) degrees of freedom (DoF), thus settling the spatial scale invariance conjecture (scaling the number of antennas at each node by a constant factor will scale the total DoF by the same factor) for this class of networks. The previously known best general DoF inner bound, inspired by the K user interference channel, was based on the decomposition of every transmitter and receiver into multiple single antenna nodes, transforming the network into an AM x AN user SISO X network. While such a decomposition is DoF optimal for the K user interference channel, a gap remained between the best inner and outer bound for the MIMO X channel. Here we close this gap with the new insight that the MIMO X network is only one-sided decomposable, i.e., either all the transmitters or all the receivers (but not both) can be decomposed by splitting multiple antenna nodes into multiple single antenna nodes without loss of DoF. The result is extended to SIMO and MISO X networks as well and in each case the DoF results satisfy the spatial scale invariance property. In addition, the feasibility of linear interference alignment is investigated based only on spatial beamforming without symbol extensions. Similar to MIMO interference networks, we show that when the problem is improper, it is infeasible. An interesting one-sided decomposability is observed here as well in the counting of variables.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Signal Space Alignment for the Gaussian Y-Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. A multiway communication network with three nodes and one relay is considered. The three nodes in this so-called the Y-channel, communicate with each other in a bi-directional manner via the relay. Studying this setup is important due to its being an important milestone for characterizing the capacity of larger networks. A transmit strategy for the Gaussian Y-channel is proposed, which mimics a previously considered scheme for the deterministic approximation of the Y-channel. Namely, a scheme which uses nested-lattice codes and lattice alignment is used, to perform network coding. A new mode of operation is introduced, named `cyclic communication', which interestingly turns out to be an important component for achieving the capacity region of the Gaussian Y-channel within within a constant gap.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Capacity of Multi-user Two-way Linear Deterministic Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; In multi-user two-way channels nodes are both sources and destinations of messages. This allows for &quot;adaptation'' at or &quot;interaction'' between the nodes -- the next channel inputs may be a function of the past received signals at a particular node. How to best adapt is key to two-way communication problems, rendering them complex and challenging. However, examples exist of channels where adaptation is not beneficial from a capacity perspective; it is known that for the point-to-point two-way modulo 2 adder and Gaussian channels, adaptation does not increase capacity. Recently, it was shown that the two-way modulo-2 additive versions of the multiple-access / broadcast (MAC/BC respectively, in the two directions), the Z channel and the interference channel also have capacity regions equal to two parallel one-way versions of the channels.&#13;
&#13;
 In this work we show that the same is true for the linear deterministic multi-user two-way channels which model their Gaussian counterparts at high SNR, which include the two-way MAC/BC channel, the two-way Z channel, and the two-way interference channel under some adaptation constraints. For all three channel models we obtain the capacity region, which is that of two one-way channels in each direction, which may be achieved without the use of adaptation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Sum Capacity of 3-user Deterministic Interference Channels with Connectivity Constraints</papertitle>

        <abstract>In this paper we derive the sum-capacity of 3-user linear deterministic interference channels (LDIC) under certain connectivity assumptions with symmetric parameters. The results also directly yield the sum-capacity of a 3-user fully-connected LDIC with symmetric parameters. We further illustrate with an example the potential difficulties in extending the results to asymmetric cases.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Sum-capacity of the Linear Deterministic Interference Channel with Partial Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; The linear deterministic interference channel (LD-IC) with partial feedback is considered. Partial feedback for the LD-IC models a scenario in which the top l most-significant-bits (MSB) of the channel output of receiver j are received as feedback at transmitter j, for $j=1,2$. The rationale for studying the LD-IC with partial feedback comes from the fact that it is a good approximation for the Gaussian interference channel (GIC) with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) corrupted output feedback (commonly referred to as noisy feedback). The main contribution of this paper is a characterization of the sum-capacity of the symmetric LD-IC with partial feedback. The differences between the models of partial feedback and rate-limited feedback are emphasized and highlighted by comparing the corresponding sum-capacities, which are shown to differ in general.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Sum-Capacity of the Linear Deterministic Three-User Cognitive Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Inspired by cognitive networks, we consider the linear deterministic  three-user cognitive interference channel with one primary and two secondary/cognitive transmitters which approximates the Gaussian channel at high SNR.  Outer bounds on the sum-rate are derived and matching transmission schemes are provided in all interference regimes, thereby completely characterizing the sum-capacity. Significant increase in the sum-capacity is demonstrated when comparing the three-user cognitive channel to the classical (non-cognitive) three-user interference channel and to the two-user cognitive channel. The paper  discusses extensions to an arbitrary number of users,  the relationship between the cognitive channel and the (fully cooperative) broadcast channel,  and observations on the behavior of the cognitive transmitters in the different interference scenarios.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Adversarial Joint Source-Channel Problem</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper introduces the problem of joint source-channel coding in the setup where channel errors are adversarial and the distortion is worst case. Unlike the situation in the case of stochastic source-channel model, the separation principle does not hold in adversarial setup. This surprising observation demonstrates that designing good distortion-correcting codes cannot be done by serially concatenating good covering codes with good error-correcting codes. The problem of the joint code design is addressed and some initial results are offered.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Strong Converse for Joint Source-Channel Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a discrete memoryless joint source-channel setting. In this setting, if a source sequence is reconstructed with distortion below some threshold, we declare a success event. We prove that for any joint source-channel scheme, if this threshold lower (better) than the optimum performance theoretically attainable, then the success probability approaches zero as the block length increases. Furthermore, we show that the probability has an exponential behavior, and evaluate the optimal exponent. Surprisingly, the best exponential behavior is attainable by a separation-based scheme.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Joint Source-Channel Coding of one Random Variable over the Poisson Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; We study the transmission of a single random variable across the Poisson channel, which takes a continuous-time waveform $\{ \lambda_t: 0 \leq \lambda_t \leq T\}$ as an input, where $0 \leq \lambda_t \leq A$, for all $0 \leq t \leq T$. The output of the channel is a non-homogeneous Poisson arrival process with rate $\lambda^T$. We explore the class of schemes that are optimal in the error exponent sense under mean squared loss. We determine a family of optimal encoders for this channel which achieves the minimum mean squared error. In addition, we characterize the error exponent for 'separation' based schemes, and also provide an upper bound for the maximal error exponent across all joint source channel strategies under this setting.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Curves on torus layers and coding for continuous alphabet sources</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we consider the problem of transmitting a continuous alphabet discrete-time source over an AWGN channel. The design of good curves for this purpose relies on geometrical properties of spherical codes and projections of $N$-dimensional lattices. We propose a constructive scheme based on a set of curves on the surface of a $2N$-dimensional sphere and present comparisons with some previous works.</abstract>

        <abstract>Consider a channel with an input alphabet that is finite but not necessarily binary. A method for approximating such a channel having a large output alphabet size by a degraded version of it having a smaller output alphabet size is presented and analyzed. The approximation method is used to construct polar codes for both single-user and multiple-access channels with prime input alphabet sizes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Polar codes for discrete alphabets</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An open problem in polarization theory is whether all memoryless channels and sources with composite (that is, non-prime) alphabet sizes can be polarized with deterministic, Arıkan-like methods. This paper answers the question in the affirmative by giving a method to polarize all discrete memoryless channels and sources. The method yields codes that retain the low encoding and decoding complexity of binary polar codes.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study polarization for nonbinary channels with input alphabet of size $q=2^r,r=2,3,\dots$. Using Arikan's polarizing kernel $H_2$, we prove that virtual channels that arise in the process of polarization converge to $q$-ary channels with capacity $1,2,\dots,r$ bits, and that the total transmission rate approaches the symmetric capacity of the channel. This leads to an explicit transmission scheme for $q$-ary channels. The error probability of decoding using successive cancellation behaves as $\exp(-N^\alpha),$ where $N$ is the code length and $\alpha$ is any constant less than $0.5.$</abstract>

        <papertitle>Polar Coding without Alphabet Extension for Asymmetric Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We consider channel coding of binary asymmetric memoryless channels with polar codes. The difficulty for asymmetric channels comes from the fact that the optimal input probability distributions are not always uniform. Sasoglu et al. realized a nonuniform input distribution by mapping multiple auxiliary symbols distributed uniformly to an actual input symbol. However, the complexity of the scheme increases considerably for the case that the input distribution cannot be approximated by simple rational numbers. To overcome this problem, we propose another polar coding scheme for asymmetric channels, which realizes the optimal nonuniform input distribution by randomizing symbols in the frozen bits with an appropriate probability distribution.</abstract>

        <abstract>At ISIT 2008, Melchor, Castagnos and Gaborit presented a lattice-based homomorphic encryption scheme (abbreviated as MCG), whose security is based on the Computational Knapsack Vector Problem. In this paper, we explore a secret linear relationship between the public keys and the secret keys, which can be used to construct a reduced-dimension lattice, and then we obtain a group of equivalent private keys by solving the Closest Vector Problem of the lattice. Moreover, our attack is practical on all the three settings of recommended parameters, and the running time to recover the equivalent private keys is only several hours on a single PC.</abstract>

        <abstract>We consider the oblivious distributed guessing of a random variable in three scenarios (single guessor, single constrained guessor, multiple guessors). The optimal guessing schemes in each case are obtained by means of a probability distribution which the guessor(s) use in order to determine their sequence of guesses. The distributions obtained are shown to have links to various generalizations of Shannon's entropy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Error Exponents for Rayleigh Fading Product MIMO Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Along with the channel capacity, the error exponent is one of the most important information theoretic measures of reliability, as it sets ultimate bounds on the performance of communication systems employing codes of finite complexity. In this paper, we derive the closed-form expressions for the Gallager's random coding and expurgated error exponents for Rayleigh fading product multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels under the assumption that there is no channel- state information (CSI) at the transmitter and perfect CSI at the receiver. From the derived analytical expressions, we get insight into an elementary tradeoff between the communication reliability and information rate for the Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels. Moreover, we can easily compute the necessary codeword length without the extensive Monte-carlo simulation to achieve predefined error probability at a given rate below the channel capacity. In addition, we derive the exact closed-form expressions for the ergodic capacity and cutoff rate based on easily computable Meijer G-function. The closed-form expressions for the error exponents, ergodic capacity and cutoff rate have also been derived for Rayleigh fading keyhole MIMO channels as the example of special case.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Ergodic Sum Capacity of Macrodiversity MIMO Systems in Flat Rayleigh Fading</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The prospect of base station cooperation has led to increased interest in macrodiversity systems, where both sources and receive antennas are geographically distributed. In this scenario, little is known about channel capacity since the channel matrices have a very general form where each path may have a different power. Hence, in this paper we consider the ergodic sum capacity of a macrodiversity MIMO system with arbitrary numbers of sources and antennas operating over Rayleigh fading channels. For this system, we compute a compact approximation to ergodic sum capacity, which is shown to be very accurate over a wide range of cases. Finally, we develop a highly simplified upper-bound which leads to insights into the relationship between capacity and the channel powers.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Characterization of the Constrained Capacity of Multiple-Antenna Fading Coherent Channels Driven by Arbitrary Inputs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper characterizes the constrained capacity of multiple-antenna fading coherent channels driven by arbitrary discrete inputs in the regime of high signal-to-noise ratio (snr). In particular, we capitalize on key asymptotic expansions to unveil the effect on the constrained capacity of various channel and system parameters, such as the fading model, the number of transmit and receive antennas, antenna correlation and the characteristics of the signalling scheme. It is also shown that the effect of certain parameters on the constrained capacity is radically different from their effect on the channel capacity achieved by Gaussian inputs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Random Matrix Approach to the Finite Blocklength Regime of MIMO Fading Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper provides a novel central limit theorem (CLT) for the information density of the MIMO Rayleigh fading channel under white Gaussian inputs, when the data blocklength $n$ and the number of transmit and receive antennas $K,N$ are large but of similar order of magnitude. This CLT is used to derive closed-form upper bounds on the error probability via Feinstein's lemma and the second-order approximation of the coding rate. Numerical evaluations suggests that the normal approximation is tight for reasonably small values of $n,K,N$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Worst-Case Expected-Rate Loss of Slow-Fading Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. For delay-limited communication over block-fading channels, the difference between the ergodic capacity and the maximum expected rate for coding over a finite number of coherent blocks represents the penalty incurred by the delay constraint. This paper introduces a notion of worst-case expected-rate loss. Focusing on the slow-fading scenario (one block delay), the worst-case expected-rate loss is precisely characterized for the point-to-point fading channel and is characterized to within one bit for the fading-paper channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Extrinsic Jensen-Shannon Divergence with Application in Active Hypothesis Testing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider a decision maker who is responsible to dynamically collect observations so as to enhance his information in a speedy manner about an underlying phenomena of interest while accounting for the penalty of wrong declarations.&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, Extrinsic Jensen-Shannon (EJS) divergence is introduced as a measure of information. Using EJS as an information utility, a heuristic policy for selecting actions is proposed. Via numerical and asymptotic optimality analysis, the performance of the proposed policy, hence the applicability of the EJS divergence in the context of the active hypothesis testing is investigated.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Controlled Sensing for Sequential Multihypothesis Testing</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of controlled sensing for multihypothesis testing is considered. Prior to decision making, a controller sequentially chooses among a set of control actions, which in turn can shape the observation model. The goal is to design an efficient control policy, a stopping rule and a final decision rule, to minimize the expected stopping time subject to hard constraints on the risks associated with wrong decisions under each hypothesis. We propose a sequential test, which is shown to be asymptotically optimal when the risks are sufficiently small. Optimality is based on a derived lower bound on the minimum expected stopping time of tests in the class of tests satisfying the predefined risk constraints. Furthermore, by viewing the variable-length coding problem as a special case of sequential multihypothesis testing with observation control, we recover the classic result of Burnashev on the expected coding length for variable-length coding over Discrete Memoryless Channels (DMCs) at zero rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Active Sequential Hypothesis Testing with Application to a Visual Search Problem</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a visual search problem where one has to identify an odd image from amongst a sea of distractors. We model the visual search task as an active sequential multiple hypothesis testing problem (ASM problem). For an ASM problem, we obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the expected stopping time for all policies that meet a specified conditional error probability tolerance criterion. We show that a class of policies proposed by Naghshvar and Javidi is ``asymptotically optimal''. Based on our model we propose a ``neuronal metric'' that captures the distinguishing capability between images. From empirical study we obtain a correlation $(0.90)$ between the proposed neuronal metric and speed of discrimination between the images.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Hypothesis testing via a comparator</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper investigates the best achievable performance by a hypothesis test satisfying a structural constraint: two functions are computed at two different terminals and the detector consists of a simple comparator verifying whether the functions agree. Such tests arise as part of study of fundamental limits of channel coding, but are also useful in other contexts. A simple expression for the Stein exponent is found and applied to showing a strong converse in the problem of multi-terminal hypothesis testing with rate constraints. Connections to the Gacs-Korner common information and to spectral properties of conditional expectation operator are identified. Further tightening of results hinges on finding lambda-blocks of minimal weight. Application of Delsarte's linear programming method to this problem is described.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Sensitivity of Compressed Sensing Performance to Relaxation of Sparsity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Many papers studying compressed sensing consider the noisy underdetermined system of linear equations: $y=Ax^0 + z^0$, with $n \times N$ measurement matrix $A$, $n &lt; N$, and Gaussian white noise $z^0$. Both $y$ and $A$ are known, both $x^0$ and $z^0$ are unknown, and we seek an approximation to $x^0$; we let $\delta = n/N \in (0,1)$ denote the undersampling fraction. In the popular strict sparsity model of compressed sensing, such papers further assume that $x^0$ has at most a specified fraction $\eps$ of nonzeros.&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, we relax the assumption of strict sparsity by assuming the vector $x^0$ is close in mean $p$-th power to a sparse signal. We study how this relaxation affects the performance of $\ell_1$-penalized $\ell_2$ minimization, in which the reconstruction $\hxl$ solves $ \min \| y - Ax\|_2^2/2 + \lambda \|x\|_1$.&#13;
&#13;
We study asymptotic mean-squared error (AMSE), the large-system limit of the MSE of $\hxl$. Using recently developed tools based on Approximate Message Passing (AMP), we develop expressions for minimax AMSE $M^*_{\eps,p}(\delta,\xi,\sigma)$ -- max over all approximately sparse signals, min over penalizations $\lambda$, where $\xi$ measures the deviation from strict sparsity. There is of course a phase transition curve $\delta^* = \delta^*(\eps)$; only above this curve, $\delta &gt; \delta^*(\eps)$, can we have exact recovery even in the noiseless-data strict-sparsity setting. It turns out that the minimax AMSE can be characterized succinctly by a coefficient $sens_p^*(\eps,\delta)$ which we refer to as the {\em sparsity-relaxation sensitivity}. We give explicit expressions for $sens^*_p(\eps,\delta)$, compute them, and interpret them. &#13;
&#13;
Our approach yields precise formulas in place of loose order bounds based on restricted isometry property and instance optimality results. Our formulas reveal that sensitivity is finite everywhere exact recovery is possible under strict sparsity, and that sensitivity to added random noise in the measurements $y$ is {\it smaller} than the sensitivity to adding a comparable amount of noise to the estimand $x^0$. Our methods can also treat the mean $q$-th power loss. The methods themselves are based on minimax decision theory and seem of independent interest.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Combinatorial Selection and Least Absolute Shrinkage via the Clash Algorithm</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot;&#13;
&#13;
The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for linear regression exploits the geometric interplay of the $\ell_2$-data error objective and the $\ell_1$-norm constraint to arbitrarily select sparse models. Guiding this uninformed selection process with sparsity models has been precisely the center of attention over the last decade in order to improve learning performance. To this end, we alter the selection process of LASSO to explicitly leverage combinatorial sparsity models (CSMs) via the combinatorial selection and least absolute shrinkage (CLASH) operator. We provide concrete guidelines how to leverage combinatorial constraints within CLASH, and characterize CLASH's guarantees as a function of the set restricted isometry constants of the sensing matrix. Finally, our experimental results show that CLASH can outperform both LASSO and model-based compressive sensing in sparse estimation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lp-Constrained Least Squares (0&lt;p&lt;1) and Its Critical Path</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The Lp-constrained least squares, which is denoted by (P_c), for 0&lt;p&lt;1 is addressed. A maximal continuous curve of its critical solutions for different bounds c forms a critical path which can be constructed with the variational method. The path is a piecewise smooth single-valued function of c, containing non-optimal points such as saddle points and local maxima in general as well as global minima. The path of global minima may coincide with a critical path but may jump from a critical path to another one. The breakpoints of the greedy path (a critical path constructed with a certain greedy selection criterion) coincide with the step-by-step solutions generated by the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). A critical point of (P_c) is also a critical point of the Lp-penalized least squares (P_lambda) which reformulates (P_c) with the Lagrangian multiplier. The greedy path is a multi-valued function of lambda and is formed by a collection of multiple critical paths of (P_lambda).</abstract>

        <papertitle>WarmL1: A Warm-start Homotopy-based Reconstruction Algorithm for Sparse Signals</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A sparse signal can be reconstructed from a small amount of random and linear measurements by solving a system of underdetermined equations. In this paper, we study the reconstruction problem while the system undergoes dynamic modifications. Resolving this problem from scratch requires high computational efforts. Therefore, we propose an efficient homotopy-based reconstruction algorithm with warm-start, named WarmL1. WarmL1 quickly updates the previous solution to the desired one. Based on the concept of homotopy, WarmL1 breaks the reconstruction procedure into simple steps, and solves the problem iteratively. Four possible applications are presented and discussed to demonstrate the usage of WarmL1 for different warm-start situations. Experiments on these applications are performed. The results show that WarmL1 achieves 3.2x to 37.5x speeding up or up to 1/5100 l2-error at the same computational cost compared to the related works.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Linear Index Coding for Random Graphs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In the index coding problem, the goal is to transmit an n character word over a field F to n receivers (one character per receiver), where the receivers have side information represented by a graph G. The objective is to minimize the length of a codeword broadcasted to all receivers which allows each receiver to learn its character. For linear index coding, the minimum possible length is known to be equal to the minrank parameter. In this paper we initiate the study of the typical minimum length of a linear index code for the random graph G(n,p) over a field F. First, we prove that for every constant size field F and a constant p, the minimum length of a linear index code for G(n,p) over F is almost surely $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Second, we introduce and study two special models of index coding and study their typical minimum length: Locally decodable index codes in which the receivers are required to query at most q characters from the encoded message (such codes naturally correspond to efficient decoding); and low density index codes in which every character of the broadcasted word affects at most q characters in the encoded message (such codes naturally correspond to efficient encoding procedures). We present enhanced results for these special models.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Index Coding: An Interference Alignment Perspective</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we study the index coding problem. The index coding problem is a (directed) multiple unicast network where there is exactly one bottleneck link. There are $K$ independent sources which share this bottleneck link. Correspondingly there are $K$ destinations which are on the receiving end of the bottleneck link, with each destination intending to decode the message of one (unique) corresponding source. The destination can have apriori side-information of a subset of the original sources (also known as antidotes). For this problem, previously, the achievable rate using scalar linear coding has been characterized. In this paper, we study the problem from the perspective of interference alignment, derive new results for the problem. In a result analogous to the degrees of freedom for the wireless interference channel, we identify the set of graphs where each user can achieve half the interference-free rate in the index coding problem. In a second result, we derive the capacity for a class of symmetric index coding networks.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Index Codes with Near-Extreme Rates</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The min-rank of a digraph was shown by Bar-Yossef et al. (2006) to represent the length of an optimal scalar linear solution of the corresponding instance of the Index Coding with Side Information (ICSI) problem. In this work, the graphs and digraphs of near-extreme min-ranks are characterized. Those graphs and digraphs correspond to the ICSI instances having near-extreme transmission rates when using optimal scalar linear index codes. It is also shown that the decision problem whether a digraph has min-rank two is NP-complete. By contrast, the same question for graphs can be answered in polynomial time.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Bipartite Index Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We analyze a generalized index coding problem that allows multiple users to request the same packet. For this problem we introduce a novel coding scheme called \emph{partition multicast}. Our scheme can be seen as a natural generalization of clique cover for directed index coding problems. Further, partition multicast corresponds to an achievable scheme for the generalized bipartite index coding problem that we introduce in this paper. Our scheme partitions the nodes into groups and solves a multicasting problem within each group. We show that Partition Multicast is optimal for a few families of graphs and generalizes previous achievable schemes, namely directed cycle covers. We also show that finding the best partition is computationally intractable to compute in general.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Pliable Index Coding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We propose a new formulation of the index coding problem, where instead of demanding a specific message, clients are &quot;pliable&quot; and are happy to receive any one message they do not have. We prove that with this relaxation, although some instances of this problem become simple, in general the problem remains NP-hard. However, we develop heuristic algorithms that in our (extensive) experimental evaluation required only a logarithmic (in the number of messages) number of broadcast transmissions; this is an exponential improvement over traditional index coding requirements.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A new achievable rate region for the 3-user discrete memoryless interference channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The $3$-user discrete memoryless interference channel is considered in this paper. We provide a new inner bound (achievable rate region) to the capacity region for this channel. This inner bound is based on a new class of code ensembles based on asymptotically good nested linear codes. This achievable region is strictly superior to the straightforward extension of Han-kobayashi rate region from the case of two-users to three-users. This rate region is characterized using single-letter information quantities. We consider examples to illustrate the rate region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Information-Spectrum Approach to the Capacity Region of General Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. This paper is concerned with general interference channels characterized by a sequence of transition (conditional) probabilities. We present a general formula for the capacity region of the interference channel with two pairs of users. The formula shows that the capacity region is the union of a family of rectangles, where each rectangle is determined by a pair of spectral inf-mutual information rates. Although the presented formula is usually difficult to compute, it provides us useful insights into the interference channels. For example, the formula suggests us that the simplest inner bounds (obtained by treating the interference as noise) could be improved by taking into account the structure of the interference processes. This is verified numerically by computing the mutual information rates for Gaussian interference channels with embedded convolutional codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On a Class of Discrete Memoryless Broadcast Interference Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We study a class of discrete memoryless broadcast interference channels (DM-BICs), where one of the broadcast receivers is subject to the interference from a point-to-point transmission. A general achievable rate region $\mathcal{R}$ based on rate splitting, superposition coding and binning at the broadcast transmitter and rate splitting at the interfering transmitter is derived. Under two partial order broadcast conditions {\em interference-oblivious less noisy} and {\em interference-cognizant less noisy}, a reduced form of $\mathcal{R}$ is shown to be equivalent to the region based on a simpler scheme that uses only superposition coding at the broadcast transmitter. Furthermore, the capacity regions of DM-BIC under the two partial order broadcast conditions are characterized respectively for the strong and very strong interference conditions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Sum Capacity of the Discrete Memoryless Interference Channel with One-Sided Weak Interference and Mixed Interference</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The sum capacity of a class of discrete memoryless interference channels is determined. This class of channels is defined analogous to the Gaussian Z-interference channel with weak interference; as a result, the sum capacity is achieved by letting the transceiver pair subject to the interference communicates at a rate such that its message can be decoded at the unintended receiver using single user detection. Moreover, this class of discrete memoryless interference channels is equivalent in capacity region to certain discrete degraded interference channels. This allows the construction of capacity outer-bound using the capacity region of associated degraded broadcast channels. The same technique is then used to determine the sum capacity of the discrete memoryless interference channel with mixed interference. The above results allow one to determine sum capacities or capacity regions of several new discrete memoryless interference channels.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Achievable Rate Region for Three-Pair Interference Channels with Noise</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An achievable rate region for certain noisy three-user-pair interference channels is proposed. The channel class under consideration generalizes the three-pair deterministic interference channel (3-DIC) in the same way as the Telatar-Tse noisy two-pair interference channel generalizes the El Gamal-Costa injective channel. Specifically, arbitrary noise is introduced that acts on the combined interference signal before it affects the desired signal. This class of channels includes the Gaussian case.&#13;
&#13;
The rate region includes the best-known inner bound on the 3-DIC capacity region, dominates treating interference as noise, and subsumes the Han-Kobayashi region for the two-pair case.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we consider a distributed MIMO communication scenario in which multiple transmitters cooperatively send common messages to a single receiver. In this scenario, it is usually costly to acquire full CSIT at all transmitters, i.e., every transmitter perfectly knows all the channel state information (CSI). Hence, we assume individual CSI at the transmitter (CSIT), i.e., each transmitter only knows its own CSI. We propose a novel precoding technique, named Hermitian precoding, to enhance the system performance under the constraint of I-CSIT. We show that the proposed scheme can perform close to the system capacity with full CSIT. This reveals that the amount of CSI required at the transmitters can be significantly reduced without considerably compromising performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the net DoF comparison between ZF and MAT over time-varying MISO broadcast channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We compare two classes of linear precoding strategies, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming and the ``MAT'' scheme recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse, over time-varying MISO broadcast channels. For a temporally correlated fading process with band-limited Doppler spectrum in $[-F,F]$, with $0 \leq F &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, it has been shown that ZF achieves a fraction $1-2F$ of the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF). On the other hand, MAT exploits delayed channel state information at transmitter (CSIT) and guarantees a constant DoF irrespectively of the fading Doppler bandwidth. In this work, we compare the net DoFs of both schemes by accounting for the correlation between fading blocks and for the resource required for downlink channel estimation. It is found that the downlink training for each receiver to learn the CSI of the others might be detrimental for the performance of MAT especially when the system size (number of users and transmit antennas) is not much smaller than the channel block length.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Proximity Factors of Lattice Reduction-Aided Precoding for Multiantenna Broadcast</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Lattice precoding is an effective strategy for multiantenna broadcast. In this paper, we show that approximate lattice precoding in multiantenna broadcast is a variant of the closest vector problem (CVP) known as $\eta$-CVP. The proximity factors of lattice reduction-aided precoding are defined, and their bounds are derived, which measure the worst-case loss in power efficiency compared to sphere precoding. Unlike decoding applications, this analysis does not suffer from the boundary effect of a finite constellation, since the underlying lattice in multiantenna broadcast is indeed infinite.</abstract>

        <papertitle>High-SNR Analysis of MIMO Linear Precoders</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>For linear MIMO precoders, the diversity is an important parameter affecting broad tradeoffs in system design, however, the diversity of many MIMO precoders has not been available in the open literature. This paper analyzes the diversity of the following MIMO precoders: the zero-forcing (ZF), regularized ZF, matched filtering and Wiener filtering. Several interesting properties of these precoders are revealed by this analysis. It is shown that regularized ZF (RZF) and the matched filter (MF) exhibit two-mode diversity: full diversity at low rates $R$ and error floor at high rates. The rate threshold of this two-mode behavior is analytically determined. The Wiener precoder is also shown to produce a diversity that depends on the spectral efficiency and can be as small as one and as large as the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Transmit-Power Efficient MIMO-THP Design</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, an improved multiple input multiple output Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (MIMO-THP) is introduced, where the transmit power loss is reduced based on optimizing the interference to be canceled. The concept behind the proposed technique builds on the fact that both the desired and interfering signals originate from the base station (BS) of the downlink system itself. Based on this observation, the proposed method influences the resulting interference, to reduce the transmission power required to cancel it, without altering the information content of the downlink message. The aim is to bring the interference closer to the replicas of the desired symbols for all users in the THP modulo-extended constellation. In this way, the power required to pre-subtract interference is decreased. Theoretical and simulation results both confirm that, by optimizing the interference to be canceled, the proposed technique offers a considerable transmit power reduction compared to conventional THP while securing an equal error rate performance.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lattice codes achieving strong secrecy over the mod-Lambda Gaussian Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a wiretap scenario where the main channel and eavesdropper's channel are modulo lattice Gaussian channels. We prove that nested lattice codes can achieve strong secrecy for this model, which gives considerable insights to tackle the genuine Gaussian wiretap channel. The key tool in our proof is an $L^1$ convergence result for the conditional output distributions corresponding to different messages, which follows from the properties of the lattice Gaussian measure. No constraint on the a priori distribution of the message is imposed, which means that the proposed scheme is actually semantically secure. We not only show the existence of lattice codes that are good for secrecy, but also propose the flatness factor as a design criterion.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Key Agreement over Gaussian Wiretap Models with Known Interference at the Transmitter</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We investigate the (forward) key capacity of a Gaussian state-dependent wiretap channel (G-SWC) paralleled with a public channel having capacity $C_{\!_P}\in [0,\infty)$. This model consists of a sender, a main receiver, and a wiretapper. The channel state information (CSI) is an additive white Gaussian interference (AWGI) which is non-causally known at the sender.\\ A lower bound (LB) on the key capacity is achieved by using a generalized version of the dirty paper coding (DPC) in which the transmitted signal is correlated with the interference. The correlation coefficient is to be determined by $C_{\!_P}$. The achievable scheme is asymptotically optimum as $C_{\!_P}\!\!\rightarrow\!\!\infty$. This optimum key capacity is also asymptotically achievable for any $C_{\!_P}\!\!\geq \!0$ in high signal to interference ratio (SIR) regime. In this regime, the public channel has negligible contribution in key generation. Generally, the CSI enhances the key capacity such that it exceeds the main channel capacity of the G-SWC in low SIR regime.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Gaussian Interference Wiretap Channel When the Eavesdropper Channel is Arbitrarily Varying</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work we study the two-user Gaussian interference wiretap channel. We focus on the case where the eavesdropper channel is unknown to the legitimate parties and is arbitrarily varying, all channel matrices have rank less than or equal to 2, and the eavesdropper has single antenna. We identify a class of these channel models for which the secrecy degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) region is achieved by letting only one user transmit a time. We also provide a non-trivial example for which such a transmission strategy is sub-optimal in terms of s.d.o.f. region. The achievable scheme for this example introduces a new technique to achieve secrecy for MIMO wiretap channels, in which one of the transmitter-receiver pairs uses linear precoding so that effectively the signals are beam-formed toward a direction that cannot be captured by the eavesdropper and is at the same time orthogonal to the interference from the remaining transmitter.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Power Allocation for GSVD-Based Beamforming in the MIMO Gaussian Wiretap Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian wiretap channel model, where there exists a transmitter, a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper, each equipped with multiple antennas. Perfect secrecy is achieved when the transmitter and the legitimate receiver can communicate at some positive rate, while ensuring that the eavesdropper gets zero bits of information. In this paper, the perfect secrecy rate of the multiple antenna MIMO wiretap channel is maximized for arbitrary numbers of antennas under the assumption that the transmitter performs beamforming based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). More precisely, the optimal allocation of power for the GSVD-based precoder that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate is derived. Numerical results are presented to illustrate that the achievable secrecy rate of the GSVD-based precoding approach is nearly identical to that of the optimal scheme.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Switched Power Allocation for MISOME Wiretap Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we consider secure communication over a multiple-input single-output Rayleigh-fading channel in the presence of a multiple-antenna eavesdropper-referred to as a multiple-input single-output multiple-eavesdropper (MISOME) wiretap channel. Specifically, secure beamforming with artificial noise is treated when the transmitter has access to full channel state information (CSI) of a legitimate channel but only partial statistical CSI of an eavesdropper channel. We first derive the optimal power allocation between the information-bearing signal and artificial noise to maximize the achievable secrecy rate in the presence of a weak or strong eavesdropper. We then develop a near-optimal power allocation strategy in a switched fashion for a general case and derive a closed-form expression for the ergodic secrecy rate achieved by secure beamforming with this switched power allocation in the MISOME wiretap channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Beyond the Bethe Free Energy of LDPC Codes via Polymer Expansions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The loop series provides a formal way to write down corrections to the Bethe entropy (and/or free energy) of graphical models. We provide methods to rigorously control such expansions for low-density parity-check codes used over a highly noisy binary symmetric channel. We prove that in the asymptotic limit of large size, with high probability, the Bethe expression gives an exact formula for the entropy (per bit) of the input word conditioned on an output realization of the channel. Our methods also apply to more general models.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Generalized EXIT Charts of LDPC Code Ensembles over Binary-Input Output-Symmetric Memoryless Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>[THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD] Generalized Extrinsic Information Transfer (GEXIT) charts were introduced as an extension of EXIT charts which have an extensive use in analysis and design of many iterative schemes including Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. While a powerful as well as an insightful concept, their full potential as a designing tool for LDPC code ensembles has not been realized due to some missing steps. This papers aims at filling these gaps by proving some important properties of GEXIT charts and using them to design capacity-approaching LDPC codes ensembles. The primary results on GEXIT charts are limited to regular variable and check node degrees. Moreover, variable node GEXIT curves have only been derived for the case where no physical channel is present. In a recent paper, GEXIT curves for irregular variable node and check node degree distributions have been derived. In this paper, we derive GEXIT charts of LDPC code ensembles over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels with any channel parameter. For the case of binary symmetric channel, we derive closed form expression for the GEXIT curve of variable nodes. We also propose to use an alternative representation of GEXIT charts in which we plot the inverse of variable node GEXIT curve together with dual GEXIT curve of the check node. We prove that the area theorem still holds in this case. Using these results, we analyze and design capacity-approaching LDPC codes using GEXIT charts.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Analysis of Error Floors of Generalized Non-binary LDPC Codes over q-ary Memoryless Symmetric Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we compare the decoding error rates in the error floors for non-binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the general linear group with those for non-binary LDPC codes over finite field transmitted over the $q$-ary memoryless symmetric channel under belief propagation decoding. To analyze non-binary LDPC codes defined over both general linear group $\mathrm{GL}(m,\mathbb{F}_2)$ and finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, we investigate non-binary LDPC code defined over $\mathrm{GL}(m_3,\mathbb{F}_{2^{m_4}})$. We propose a method to lower the error floors for non-binary LDPC codes. In this analysis, we see that the optimized non-binary LDPC codes defined over general linear group have the same decoding performance in the error floors as those defined over finite field. The non-binary LDPC codes defined over general linear group have more choices of the labels in the edges which satisfy the condition for the optimization.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Finite-length analysis of the TEP decoder for LDPC ensembles over the BEC</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this work, we analyze the finite-length performance of low-density parity check (LDPC) ensembles decoded over the binary erasure channel (BEC) using the tree-expectation propagation (TEP) algorithm. In a previous paper, we showed that the TEP improves the BP performance for decoding regular and irregular short LDPC codes, but the perspective was mainly empirical. In this work, given the degree-distribution of an LDPC ensemble, we explain and predict the range of code lengths for which the TEP improves the BP solution. In addition, for LDPC ensembles that present a single critical point, we propose an scaling law to accurately predict the performance in the waterfall region. These results are of critical importance to design practical good-LDPC codes for the TEP decoder.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Properties and encoding aspects of direct product convolutional codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we investigate on the properties of the generator matrices of a new class of convolutional codes, called product convolutional codes, which were previously defined and investigated by the authors. The new codes are constructed using the well-known method of the direct product for combining block codes. Convolutional codes are considered as block codes over the field of rational functions F(D). The description of convolutional codes as block codes allows the successful application of the direct product method to convolutional codes, and, in addition, leads to a general method to construct new convolutional codes based on already known combining methods for block codes. Expressions for the generator matrices of the product convolutional codes are given and several of their properties, which were not addressed before, are determined. The relationship between the properties of the direct product encoder generator matrix and the properties of the vertical and horizontal constituent encoders generator matrices is derived. Rational generator matrices, as well as polynomial generator matrices, are addressed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Efficient Decoding of Partial Unit Memory Codes of Arbitrary Rate</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Partial Unit Memory (PUM) codes are a special class of convolutional codes, which are often constructed by means of block codes. Decoding of PUM codes may take advantage of existing decoders for the block code. The Dettmar-Sorger algorithm is an efficient decoding algorithm for PUM codes, but allows only low code rates. The same restriction holds for several known PUM code constructions. In this paper, an arbitrary-rate construction, the analysis of its distance parameters and a generalized decoding algorithm for PUM codes of arbitrary rate are provided. The correctness of the algorithm is proven and it is shown that its complexity is cubic in the length.</abstract>

        <papertitle>SISO MAP Decoding of Rate-1 Recursive Convolutional Codes: A Revisit</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we revisit the BCJR soft-input soft-output (SISO) maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding process of rate-1 general recursive (GR) convolutional codes. From this we establish some interesting duality properties between encoding and decoding of GR codes. We observe that the forward and backward BCJR SISO MAP decoders can be simply represented by their dual SISO channel encoders using shift registers in the complex number field. Similarly, the bidirectional MAP decoding can be implemented by linearly combining the outputs of the dual SISO encoders of the respective forward and backward decoders.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Best Rate 1/2 Convolutional Codes for Turbo Equalization with Severe ISI</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We give a procedure to find good convolutional codes for use with iterative decoding (turbo equalization) of the coded AWGN intersymbol interference (ISI) channel. The method is based on the input--output bit error rate characteristics of the convolutional and ISI BCJR modules that make up the decoder, in combination with the code minimum distance. Best feedforward and recursive systematic codes are listed for memories 2--4, and some individual good codes at memory 5. Codes are tested over a root raised-cosine faster-than-Nyquist channel with severe ISI. Turbo BER performance improves with code memory, reaching 1.4--1.8 dB from capacity with a 4--16 state codes. Feedforward codes perform better than recursive systematic codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Low Complexity Syndrome Based Decoding of Turbo Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A new syndrome trellis based decoding approach for Turbo coded data is described in this paper. Based on estimating error symbols instead of code symbols, it inherently features options for reducing the computational complexity of the decoding process. After deriving required transition metrics, numerical results in terms of block error rate and required equivalent iterations are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Message-Passing Algorithms for Channel Estimation and Decoding Using Approximate Inference</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We design iterative receiver schemes for a generic wireless communication system by treating channel estimation and information decoding as an inference problem in graphical models. We introduce a recently proposed inference framework that combines belief propagation (BP) and the mean field (MF) approximation and includes these algorithms as special cases. We also show that the expectation propagation and expectation maximization algorithms can be embedded in the BP-MF framework with slight modifications. By applying the considered inference algorithms to our probabilistic model, we derive four different message-passing receiver schemes. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates that the receiver based on the BP-MF framework and its variant based on BP-EM yield the best compromise between performance, computational complexity and numerical stability among all candidate algorithms.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Bidirectional Channel Estimation Using Adaptive Pilots</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Two users at the two ends of a bidirectional channel wish to estimate the common state of the channel. The problem is usually treated as two separate one-way channel estimation problems: User 1 sends deterministic pilots to assist user 2 in estimating the channel, and vice versa. This paper questions whether such separation is optimal. In other words, is it beneficial to let a user choose pilots that adapt to what the user has learned about the channel? Two concrete models are studied to show that the answer is often positive. In the special case of a Gaussian channel with colored interference, an iterative bidirectional estimation scheme is proposed, which achieves significantly better performance than separate one-way estimation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Delay-Doppler Channel Estimation with Almost Linear Complexity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A fundamental task in wireless communication is channel estimation: Compute the channel parameters a signal undergoes while traveling from a transmitter to a receiver. In the case of delay-Doppler channel, a widely used method is the matched filter algorithm. It uses a pseudo-random waveform of length N; and, in case of non-trivial relative velocity between transmitter and receiver, its computational complexity is O(N^2log(N)). In this paper we introduce a novel approach of designing waveforms that allow faster channel estimation. Using group representation techniques we construct waveforms, which enable us to introduce a new algorithm, called the flag method, that significantly improves the matched filter algorithm. The flag method finds the channel parameters in O(m Nlog(N)) operations, for channel of sparsity of order m. We discuss applications of the flag method to GPS, and radar system as well.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Efficient Algorithms for Calculating Euclidean Distance Spectra of Muliti-User Continuous Phase Modulation Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The performance of maximum likelihood detection of a coded modulation scheme over an additive white Gaussian noise channel can be predicted precisely by its Euclidean distance spectrum. In this paper, three algorithms are developed to generate the Euclidean distance spectra. The first algorithm is an exhaustive tree-search algorithm which is simplified by exploiting the correspondence between a code tree and the trellis. This algorithm is then modified to incorporate the A* algorithm and results in two heuristic algorithms. Moreover, the technique of trellis minimization is further developed for the multi user case and employed to reduce the complexity and memory requirements. Numerical results confirm that the proposed algorithms can generate the distance spectra of all systems with lower complexity relative to previous methods and are particular suited for multi user CPM systems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Joint Synchronization and Demodulation by Forward Filtering</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In a typical receiver, symbol synchronization must be established before symbol demodulation. This paper discusses synchronization for an isolated symbol from a filter-bank type multicarrier system. It is shown that accurate symbol timing for a single multicarrier symbol can be obtained using forward-only processing. The proposed receiver computes continuous-time symbol likelihoods along with a timing metric and its time derivative. The timing metric shows a sharp concentration that is used to produce a trigger to sample the matched filter outputs. The paper proposes baseband processing using message passing algorithms derived from factor graphs. Suitable system parameters for which near-optimum synchronization is obtained are identified using computer simulations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Equivalence of TCM Encoders</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Optimal trellis-coded modulation (TCM) schemes are obtained by jointly designing the convolutional encoder and the binary labeling of the constellation. Unfortunately this approach is infeasible for large encoder memories or constellation sizes. Traditional TCM designs circumvent this problem by using a labeling that follows the set-partitioning principle and by performing an exhaustive search over the encoders. Therefore, traditional TCM schemes are not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we study binary labelings for TCM and show how they can be grouped into classes, which considerably reduces the search space in a joint design. For the particular case of 8-ary modulation the search space is reduced from 40320 to 240. Using this classification, we formally prove that for any channel it is always possible to design a TCM system based on the binary-reflected Gray code with identical performance to the one proposed by Ungerboeck in 1982. Moreover, the classification is used to tabulate asymptotically optimal TCM schemes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Performance Estimation of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation Based on Information Processing Characteristics</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Information processing characteristics (IPC) provide a general framework for the analysis of a coding scheme. In this paper, we utilize IPCs to obtain performance estimates for the end-to-end coded channel for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) using a given modulation format and coding scheme, i.e., its bit error rate and capacity. The proposed method enables to fully decouple the analysis of the coding scheme from the analysis of the higher-order modulation scheme and delivers very good performance estimates. Exemplarily, this is validated by means of numerical simulations for BICM using convolutional- and LDPC-coded amplitude-shift keying.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Cooperative Diversity via Set-Partitioning in BICM: Outage Analysis and Frame Interleaving</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>(THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD.) This paper considers cooperative diversity in the context of bandwidth-efficient modulation. Specifically, it analyzes a scenario in which high-order modulation -- 16-QAM is used for illustration -- is used in a way that enables two partners to cooperatively convey their data to a common destination. This approach uses set partitioning so that &quot;relayed&quot; data selects a sparse subset while &quot;local&quot; data selects the transmitted symbol from that subset. An outage probability analysis is presented that illustrates the advantage of this technique over the conventional time-sharing approach to cooperative diversity; for 16-QAM, coding gains range from 1.5 dB (for a spectral efficiency of 0.5 bits/symbol) to 3.2 dB (for a spectral efficiency of 1.5). Then, a variation on this approach -- in which codewords are spread out over multiple frames (and multiple channel realizations) -- is examined and shown to provide a substantial gain at the cost of delay.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Mismatched Shaping Schemes for Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) with shaping, where instead of the true bit or symbol probabilities and constellation used at the transmitter, the decoder can use arbitrary probabilities or reference constellations. We study the corresponding low- and high- signal-to-noise-ratio regimes and show that even in the presence of this extra sources of mismatch, BICM has a negligible penalty with respect to coded modulation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Achieving the Shannon Limit with Probabilistically Shaped BICM</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Probabilistic shaping for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is investigated. Using known results for BICM systems with a uniform input distribution, the combinations of input alphabet, input distribution, and binary labeling that achieve the Shannon limit -1.59 dB are fully characterized. It is found that a BICM system achieves the Shannon limit at low SNR if and only if it can be represented as a zero-mean linear projection of a hypercube, which is the same condition as for uniform input distributions. Hence, probabilistic shaping offers no extra degrees of freedom to optimize the low-SNR mutual information of BICM systems, in addition to what is provided by geometrical shaping.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Systematic DFT Frames: Principle and Eigenvalues Structure</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Motivated by a host of recent applications requiring some amount of redundancy, frames are becoming a standard tool in the signal processing toolbox. In this paper, we study a specific class of frames, know as discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codes, and introduce the notion of systematic frames for this class. This is encouraged by application of systematic DFT codes in distributed source coding using DFT codes, a new application for frames. Studying their extreme eigenvalues, we show that, unlike DFT frames, systematic DFT frames are not necessarily tight. Then, we come up with conditions for which these frames can be tight. In either case, the best and worst systematic frames are established from reconstruction error point of view. Eigenvalues of DFT frames, and their subframes, play a pivotal role in this work.</abstract>

We study the problem of sampling a random signal with sparse support in frequency domain. Shannon famously considered a scheme that \emph{instantaneously} samples the signal at equispaced times. He proved that the signal can be reconstructed as long as the sampling rate exceeds twice the bandwidth (Nyquist rate). Cand\`es, Romberg, Tao introduced a scheme that acquires \emph{instantaneous} samples of the signal at random times. They proved that the signal can be uniquely and efficiently reconstructed, provided the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, times logarithmic factors. &#13;
&#13;
In this paper we consider a probabilistic model for the signal, and a sampling scheme inspired by the idea of \emph{spatial coupling} in coding theory. Namely, we propose to acquire \emph{non-instantaneous} samples at random times. Mathematically, this is implemented by acquiring a small random subset of Gabor coefficients. We show empirically that this scheme achieves correct reconstruction as soon as the sampling rate exceeds the frequency support of the signal, thus reaching the information theoretic limit.</abstract>

        <papertitle>New Construction of A Near-optimal Partial Fourier Codebook Using The Structure of Binary m-sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A codebook, or equivalently a frame, has many applications in communications, signal processing, and quantum computing. In the applications, it is required that the maximum magnitude of inner products between a pair of distinct code vectors should meet the Welch bound equality strictly or asymptotically. In this paper, a new $(N, K)$ codebook is constructed from a $K \times N$ partial Fourier matrix with $N=K^2-1$ and $K=2^k$ for an integer $k \geq 2$, where each code vector is equivalent to a column of the matrix. To obtain the $K \times N$ partial Fourier matrix, $K$ rows are selected from the $N \times N$ inverse discrete Fourier transform matrix, where a set of the selected row indices is determined from the structure of binary $m$-sequences of period $N$. Through a theoretical study, it is found that the magnitude of inner products between distinct code vectors is two-valued, and its maximum nearly achieves the Welch bound equality. With cyclotomic cosets modulo $N$, it is also presented how to generate the row indices in a systematic and efficient way. The new near-optimal codebook, equivalent to a nearly equiangular tight frame, can find its potential applications in deterministic compressed sensing.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Behavior of the Minimum Singular Value of a Random Vandermonde Matrix</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper examines the behavior of the minimum singular value of a random Vandermonde matrix. In particular, we prove that the minimum singular value $\lambda_1$ is at most $N^2\exp(-C\sqrt{N}))$ where $N$ is the dimension of the matrix and $C$ is a constant. Furthermore, the value of the constant $C$ is determined explicitly. The main result is obtain in two different ways. One approach uses techniques from stochastic processes and in particular, a construction related with the Brownian bridge. The other one, is a more direct analytical approach involving combinatorics and complex analysis. As a consequence, we obtain a result on the lower bound of the maximum of a random polynomial on the unit circle. We believe that this has independent mathematical interest.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Applications of the Shannon-Hartley Theorem to Data Streams and Sparse Recovery</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The Shannon-Hartley theorem bounds the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a Gaussian channel in terms of the ratio of the signal to noise power. We show two unexpected applications of this theorem in computer science: (1) we give a much simpler proof of an Omega(n^{1−2/p}) bound on the number of linear measurements required to approximate the p-th frequency moment in a data stream, and show a new distribution which is hard for this problem, (2) we show that the number of measurements needed to solve the k-sparse recovery problem on an n-dimensional vector x with the C-approximate l_2/l_2 guarantee is Omega(k log(n/k)/ log C). We complement this result with an almost matching O(k log^* k log(n/k)/ log C) upper bound.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Expander Graph Based Overlapped Chunked Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. Chunked codes are a variation of random linear network codes with low computational complexities. In chunked codes, the packets in a file are grouped into small (non-overlapped or overlapped) chunks, and random linear encoding operations are performed within each chunk. Previous studies show that when the chunk size is lower bounded by some increasing function of the file length, chunked codes asymptotically achieve the min-cut capacity. However, in most real applications, the chunk size is required to be a small constant due to the computational constraints of network devices. In this case, it remains unknown which rates can be achieved by chunked codes. In this paper, we address the analysis and design of chunked codes with fixed constant chunk sizes. We first highlight the importance of precoding for chunked codes to achieve positive constant rates, and then present an analysis of non-overlapped chunked (NOC) codes with precoding. We further introduce a new class of chunked codes, called EOC codes, which are based on expander graph to form overlapped chunks. Numerical and simulation results show that EOC codes achieve significantly higher rates than NOC codes, and also outperform other state-of-the-art overlapped chunked codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Densifying Coding Opportunities in Instantly Decodable Network Coding Graphs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we propose a coding strategy that maximizes the density of the coding opportunities in instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). Using the graph representation of IDNC, we derive the expression for the expected evolutions of coding opportunities after the transmission of any arbitrary coded packet and show that serving the maximum number of receivers, with the largest numbers of missing packets and erasure probabilities, tends to both maximize the expected number of coding opportunities and increase the expected coding density almost monotonically. Simulation results justify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the importance of maintaining high coding density when optimizing long-term parameters.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we study the coding delay and the average coding delay of random linear network codes (dense codes) over line networks with deterministic regular and Poisson transmission schedules. We consider both lossless networks and networks with Bernoulli losses. The upper bounds derived in this paper, which are in some cases more general, and in some other cases tighter, than the existing bounds, provide a more clear picture of the speed of convergence of dense codes to the min-cut capacity of line networks.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Decoding Delay of Intra-session Random Linear Network Coding for Line Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Random linear network coding (RLNC) can improve the reliability of end-to-end communication in the presence of erasure channels. In RLNC with intra-session coding, an intermediate node creates coded packets by combining the packets of various sources destined for a destination. Each transmitted packet contains information of multiple sources. In this paper, we study the decoding delay of RLNC with intra-session coding for a line network with $S$ sources and a destination. Given the generation size $K$, we show that the expected decoding delay is upper-bounded by $\sqrt{\eta_2 K \log(S)} + K\eta_1 + \eta$, where $\eta$, $\eta_1$, $\eta_2$ are constants. The analytical results are validated via simulations. We also compare the results with the case where intra-session coding is not used.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Subspace Alignment Chains and the Degrees of Freedom of the Three-User MIMO Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We show that the 3 user M_T x M_R MIMO interference channel where each transmitter is equipped with M_T and each receiver is equipped with M_R antennas has min(M/(2-1/k),N/(2+1/k)) degrees of freedom (DoF) per user normalized by time, frequency, and space dimensions, where N = max(M_T,M_R), M = min(M_T,M_R), k = ceil of (M/(N-M)). While the information theoretic DoF outer bound is established for every M, N value, the achievability, relying only on linear interference alignment, is established in general subject to a normalization with respect to spatial-extensions, i.e., the scaling of the number of antennas at all nodes. In the absence of spatial extensions, we can also show through examples how essentially the same alignment scheme may be applied over time or frequency extensions. The central new insight to emerge from this work is the notion of subspace alignment chains as DoF bottlenecks. The subspace alignment chains are instrumental both in identifying the extra dimensions provided by a genie to a receiver for the DoF outer bound, as well as constructing the optimal interference alignment schemes. In addition, our results also settle the question of feasibility of linear interference alignment for the 3 user M_T x M_R MIMO interference channel, for all values of M_T, M_R.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Genie Chains and the Degrees of Freedom of the K-User MIMO Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We characterize the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the K&gt;3 user M_T x M_R MIMO Gaussian interference channel where each transmitter is equipped with M_T and each receiver is equipped with M_R antennas. Expressing the DoF characterization as a function of the ratio y = M/N, where M = min(M_T,M_R) and N = max(M_T,M_R), a sharp transition point is observed at M/N = (K-1)/(K(K-2)) = yo. Below this value, i.e., for y &lt; yo, the DoF value per user is piecewise linear depending on M and N alternately, and above this value, i.e., for y &gt; yo, the DoF value per user is MN/(M+N), the value already known to be achievable with each transmit and receive antenna operating as an independent node. Notably, the latter regime, which is the dominant regime for K &gt; 3 users and is main focus of this paper, is not encountered in the recently solved K=3 user setting, highlighting the fundamentally different character of the DoF for K &gt; 3 versus the K = 3 setting. Our DoF results in this regime are obtained through a novel &quot;genie chains&quot; approach, which is the main contribution of this work. It is a chain of mappings from genie signals provided to a receiver to the exposed signal spaces at that receiver, which then serve as the genie signals for the next receiver in the chain, until an acceptable genie with the required number of dimensions is obtained, essentially converting an information theoretic problem into a linear algebra problem.</abstract>

In this paper, we propose a test for checking the feasibility of linear interference alignment (IA) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels with constant coefficients for any number of users, antennas and streams per user. We consider the compact complex manifold formed by those channels, precoders and decoders that satisfy the polynomial IA equations (the so-called solution variety), and study its projection onto the input space formed by the interference channels. When the derivative of this projection is surjective, namely when the tangent space of the solution variety is projected into the whole tangent space of the inputs space, the linear alignment problem is feasible; otherwise is infeasible. Building on these results, a general feasibility test, which amounts to check whether a given matrix is full-rank or not, is proposed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Feasibility Conditions of Interference Alignment for MIMO Interference Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Attributed by its breakthrough performance in interference networks, interference alignment (IA) has attracted great attention in the last few years. However, despite the tremendous works dedicated to IA, the feasibility conditions of IA processing remains unclear for most network typologies. The IA feasibility analysis is challenging as the IA constraints are sets of high-degree polynomials, for which no systematic tool to analyze the solvability conditions exists. In this work, by developing a new mathematical framework that maps the solvability of sets of polynomial equations to the linear independence of their first-order terms, we propose a sufficient condition that applies to K-pairs MIMO interference networks with general typologies. We have further proved that the sufficient condition aligns with the necessary conditions under some special configurations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Grassmannian-Euclidean Superposition for MIMO Broadcast Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In multiantenna broadcast channels without channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), orthogonal transmission (e.g., TDMA) is known to achieve maximal degrees of freedom either with perfect channel state information at receiver (CSIR), or when no receiver has CSIR. Recently, it has been shown [1] that TDMA is no longer optimal in cases of unequal CSIR, e.g., when one receiver has CSIR and another does not. This paper proposes a multiplicative superposition that attains degrees of freedom uniformly higher than [1] and TDMA. The proposed scheme uses coherent signaling for the receiver with CSIR, and Grassmannian signaling for the receiver without CSIR. This signaling structure is shown to attain the optimal degrees of freedom under a wide set of antenna configurations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Throughput Penalty of Fair Scheduling Algorithms on Multiple Antenna Broadcast Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Fairness consideration in the wireless resource scheduling is important for enhancing the quality of user experience, despite the consequent throughput loss. This paper analyzes the associated penalty in obtaining a certain fairness criteria for multiple antenna broadcast channels. We define a fairness penalty as the achievable sum-rate difference in the regime of high SNR. We show that the penalty for the max-product fair scheduling criterion is negligible and derive the penalty for the max-min fair scheduling criterion. We analyze ergodic behaviors for the Rayleigh-fading channel both when the average SNRs are homogeneous (identical) and when the SNRs are heterogeneous (different). For the homogeneous case, it is shown that the penalty diminishes as the number of transmit antennas increases. For the heterogeneous case, there is an inevitable bias term which is associated with the users' SNR distribution.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Degrees of Freedom of Time Correlated MISO Broadcast Channel with Delayed CSIT</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the time correlated MISO broadcast channel where the transmitter has partial knowledge on the current channel state, in addition to delayed channel state information (CSI). Rather than exploiting only the current CSI, as the zero-forcing precoding, or only the delayed CSI, as the Maddah-Ali-Tse~(MAT) scheme, we propose a seamless strategy that takes advantage of both. The achievable degrees of freedom of the proposed scheme is characterized in terms of the ``quality'' of the current channel knowledge.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Extremal Inequality and the Capacity Region of the Degraded MIMO Compound Gaussian Broadcast Channel with Multiple Users</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Weingarten et. al characterized the capacity region of a two-user compound MIMO broadcast channel when the two users exhibit a certain degradedness order. To show that Gaussian inputs attain the capacity region, they proved a new extremal inequality and made use of the channel enhancement technique as well. In this paper, we prove a generalization of the extremal inequality considered by Weingarten et. al. We then apply the generalized extremal inequality to characterize the capacity region of the $N$-user compound MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel when the $N$ users exhibit a degradedness order similar to the two-user case. Unlike the proof for the two-user case, our proof does not require the use of the channel enhancement technique.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Supermarket Game</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. A supermarket game is considered with $N$ FCFS queues with unit exponential service rate and global Poisson arrival rate $N \lambda$. Upon arrival each customer chooses a number of queues to be sampled uniformly at random and joins the least loaded sampled queue. Customers are assumed to have cost for both waiting and sampling, and they want to minimize their own expected total cost. We study the supermarket game in a mean field model that corresponds to the limit as $N$ converges to infinity in the sense that (i) for a fixed symmetric customer strategy, the joint equilibrium distribution of any fixed number of queues converges as $N \to \infty$ to a product distribution determined by the mean field model and (ii) a Nash equilibrium for the mean field model is an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite $N$ model with $N$ sufficiently large. It is shown that there always exists a Nash equilibrium for $\lambda &lt;1$ and the Nash equilibrium is unique for $\lambda^2 \le 1/2$. Furthermore, we find that the action of sampling more queues by some customers has a positive externality on the other customers.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Game Theoretic Model for the Gaussian Broadcast Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The behavior of \textit{rational} and \textit{selfish} players (receivers) over a multiple-input multiple-output Gaussian broadcast channel is investigated using the framework of non-cooperative game theory. In contrast to the game-theoretic model of the Gaussian multiple access channel where the set of feasible actions for each player is independent of other players' actions, the strategies of the players in the \textit{broadcast channel} are mutually coupled, usually by a \textit{sum power} or \textit{joint covariance} constraint, and hence cannot be treated using traditional Nash equilibrium solution concepts. To characterize the strategic behavior of receivers connected to a single transmitter, this paper models the broadcast channel as a generalized Nash equilibrium problem with coupled constraints. The concept of normalized equilibrium (NoE) is used to characterize the equilibrium points and the existence and uniqueness of the NoE are proven for key scenarios.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Incentives for Cooperative Relaying in a Simple Information-Theoretic Model</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Various cooperative communication schemes have been proposed as a means to increase the capacity of wireless networks. All such schemes assume that users in the network will cooperate perfectly. However, in a decentralized network this assumption is far from true. Users are selfish and care only about their own rates. They can strategically deviate from their agreed role in such cooperative communication schemes leading to a possible degradation for all. In this paper, we study the incentives for cooperative relaying in a simple model, namely the generalized Gaussian relay channel model (or MAC-GF). We characterize all the Nash equilibrium (NE) rates and compare it with the Pareto-optimal rates of the generalized Gaussian relay channel model. We show that the Willems scheme for cooperative relaying [3] is fairly robust with strategic users but &quot;cooperation&quot; cannot be taken for granted.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Graph Cover Ensembles of Non-binary Protograph LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper introduces a novel class of non-binary graph-based codes, built upon graph covers of non-binary protograph LDPC codes. This new ensemble is more restrictive than previously considered constructions, but in turn is much simpler to design and implement. The simplifications in design allow for the enumeration of codeword weight, trapping set size, stopping set size, and pseudo codeword weights, both as exact quantities in the finite-length regime and as corresponding growth rates in the asymptotic setting. The presented construction and the accompanying enumerations enhance the analytical toolbox of non-binary LDPC codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Analysis and Design of Ultra-Sparse Non-Binary Cluster-LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper continues a previous work on non-binary cluster-LDPC codes. Such codes are defined by locally dense parity-check matrices, with (possibly rectangular) dense clusters of bits, but which are cluster-wise sparse. We derive a lower bound on the minimum distance of non-binary cluster-LDPC codes that is based on the topological properties of the underlying bipartite graph. We also propose an optimization procedure, which allows designing finite length codes with large minimum distance, even in the extreme case of codes defined by ultra-sparse graphs, i.e. graphs with all symbol-nodes of degree $d_v=2$. Furthermore, we provide asymptotic thresholds of ensembles of non-binary cluster-LDPC codes, which are computed exactly under the Belief Propagation decoding, and upper-bounded under the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoding. We show that the MAP-threshold upper bounds, which are conjunctured to be tight, quickly approach the channel capacity, which confirms the excellent minimal distance properties of non-binary cluster-LDPC codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A New Ensemble of Rate-Compatible LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we presented three approaches to improve the design of Kite codes (newly proposed rateless codes), resulting in an ensemble of rate-compatible LDPC codes with coding rates varying continuously from 0.1 to 0.9 for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The new ensemble rate-compatible LDPC codes can be constructed conveniently with an empirical formula. Simulation results show that, when applied to incremental redundancy hybrid automatic repeat request (IR-HARQ) system, the constructed codes (with higher order modulation) perform well in a wide range of signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Fourier domain representation of non-binary LDPC codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we propose a binary representation of non-binary codes, which consists in a q-fold covering of the non-binary graph, where q is the size of the non-binary alphabet. It is shown that this covering graph is actually the underlying graph of the Fourier-domain Belief-Propagation decoding, meaning that the exchanged messages carry information about the bit-nodes of the covering graph. Finally, a new coding scheme is proposed, in which the bits transmitted over the channel correspond to a set of bit-nodes of the Fourier domain representation. The proposed coding scheme allows using the same decoder, regardless of how many and which of the Fourier-domain bit-nodes have been transmitted. This considerably increases the flexibility of the system, without increasing its complexity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Secure Network Coding and Non-Malleable Codes: Protection Against Linear Tampering</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>At ICS 2010, Dziembowski et al. introduced the notion of Non-Malleable Codes (NMC), adapting the cryptographic notion of non-malleability to the coding theory. Using NMC, if an attacker modifies a codeword, decoding this modified codeword will return either the original message or a completely unrelated value.&#13;
&#13;
The property of non-malleability depends on a family of modifications authorized to the attacker. In their paper, Dziembowski et al. propose a construction valid for the family of all bit-wise independent functions. At ITW 2011, Chabanne et al. proposed another construction for non-malleable codes w.r.t. bit-wise independent tampering functions by drawing a parallel between NMC and the Wire-Tap Channel II.&#13;
&#13;
In this paper, we show that the construction using Linear Coset Coding proposed by Chabanne et al. is non-malleable w.r.t. a larger class of functions, by considering linear tampering. Our results are derived from security results on Secure Network Coding using Linear Coset Coding, introduced by El Rouayheb and Soljanin at ISIT 2007.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On a Class of Three-Weight Codes with Cryptographic Applications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Linear codes with good algebraic structures have been used in a number of cryptographic or information-security applications, such as wire-tap channels of type II and secret sharing schemes. For a code-based secret sharing scheme, the problem of determining the minimal access sets is reduced to finding the minimal codewords of the dual code. It is well known that the latter problem is a hard problem for an arbitrary linear code. Constant weight codes and two-weight codes have been studied in the literature, for their applications to secret sharing schemes. In this paper, we study a class of three-weight codes. Making use of the finite projective geometry, we will give a sufficient and necessary condition for a linear code to be a three-weight code. The geometric approach that we will establish also provides a convenient method to construct three-weight codes. More importantly, we will determine the minimal codewords of a three-weight code, making use of the geometric approach.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Private Stream Search at the Same Communication Cost as a Regular Search: Role of LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Private Stream Search allows users to perform keyword-based queries to a database without revealing any information about the keywords they are searching. Using homomorphic encryption, Ostrovsky and Skeith proposed a computationally secure solution to this problem in 2005. However, their solution requires the server to send an answer of size O(m log m) bits when m documents of S bits match the query, while a non-private query only requires mS bits. In this work we propose two new communication optimal constructions, both allowing a communication expansion factor (compared to a non-private query) asymptotically equal to 1 when m and S increase. More precisely, our first scheme requires m(S+O(log t)) bits (where t is the size of the database) and our second scheme m(S+C) where C is a constant depending on the chosen computational security level.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Mutual Information for a Deletion Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In a deletion channel, symbols are deleted with probability $d$ at unknown positions. Despite significant effort, little is known about its capacity. The output of such a channel is a subsequence of the input sequence. This observation allows us to relate results on hidden pattern matching to present some new findings on the mutual information of the channel. Our goal is to provide a more detailed characterization of the mutual information and the channel capacity for memoryless sources (however, extension to Markovian sources is possible) for two special cases: $d\to 1$ and $d\to 0$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Recognition Capacity Versus Search Speed in Noisy Databases</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The tradeoff between the number of distinguishable objects and search speed in a data management system is investigated in an information-theoretic framework. In the discussed scenario, incoming high-dimensional (and noisy) data vectors are enrolled in (possibly multiple) clusters to be accessed later. Upon receiving a random query, which is the noisy version of an enrolled vector, the search engine retrieves only a subset of the clusters to compare against the query. This creates tension between the search speed (determined by the expected number of retrieved entries) and recognition capacity (maximum possible number of entries that can be reliably recognized). A single-letter achievable rate region is characterized and it is shown with examples that search can be performed much faster in the discussed scenario than in non-clustered linear scan without compromising maximum recognition capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Fingerprinting Capacity Games for Arbitrary Alphabets and Their Asymptotics</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Fingerprinting capacity has recently been derived as the value of a two-person zero-sum game. In this work, we study fingerprinting capacity games with k pirates under the combined digit model proposed by Skoric et al. For small k, capacities along with optimal strategies for both players of the game are obtained explicitly. For large k, we extend our earlier asymptotic analysis for the binary alphabet to this general model and show that capacity is asymptotic to A/k^2 where the constant A is identified. Saddle-point solutions to the functional maximin game are obtained using methods of variational calculus.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Universal communication over unknown vector channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider communication over a channel whose probabilistic model is completely unknown vector-wise and is not assumed to be stationary. Communication over such channels is challenging because knowing the past does not indicate anything about the future. The existence of reliable feedback and common randomness is assumed. In a previous paper it was shown that the Shannon capacity cannot be attained, in general, if the channel is not known. An alternative notion of ``capacity'' was defined, which is the maximum rate of reliable communication by any block-coding system used over consecutive blocks. This rate was shown to be achievable for the modulo-additive channel with an individual, unknown noise sequence, and not achievable for some channels with memory. In this paper this ``capacity'' is shown to be achievable for general channel models possibly including memory, as long as this memory fades with time. In other words, there exists a system with feedback and common randomness that without knowledge of the channel, asymptotically performs as well as any block-coding system, which may be designed knowing the channel. For non-fading memory channels a weaker type of ``capacity'' is shown to be achievable.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Porosity of Additive Noise Sequences</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Consider a binary modulo-additive noise channel with noiseless feedback. When the noise is a stationary and ergodic process $\mathbf{Z}$, the capacity is $1-\mathbb{H}(\mathbf{Z})$ ($\mathbb{H}(\cdot)$ denoting the entropy rate). It is shown analogously that when the noise is a deterministic sequence $z^\infty$, the capacity under finite-state encoding and decoding is $1-\overline{\rho}(z^\infty)$, where $\overline{\rho}(\cdot)$ is Lempel and Ziv's finite-state compressibility. This quantity is termed the \emph{porosity} $\underline{\sigma}(\cdot)$ of an individual noise sequence. A sequence of schemes are presented that universally achieve porosity for any noise sequence. These results may be interpreted both as a channel-coding counterpart to Ziv and Lempel's work in universal source coding, as well as an extension of the work by Lomnitz and Feder and Shayevitz and Feder on communication across modulo-additive channels.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The task of the binary classification problem is to determine which of two distributions has generated a length-$n$ test sequence. The two distributions are unknown; however two training sequences of length $N$, one from each distribution, are observed. The distributions share an alphabet of size $m$, which is significantly larger than $n$ and $N$. How does $N,n,m$ affect the probability of classification error? We characterize the achievable error rate in a high-dimensional setting in which $N,n,m$ all tend to infinity, under the assumption that probability of any symbol is $O(m^{-1})$. The results are:&#13;

There exists an asymptotically consistent classifier if and only if $m=o(\min\{N^2,Nn\})$. This extends the previous consistency result in [1] to the case $N\neq n$.&#13;
&#13;
For the sparse sample case where $\max\{n,N\}=o(m)$, finer results are obtained: The best achievable probability of classification error decays as $-\log(P_e)=J \min\{N^2, Nn\}(1+o(1))/m$ with $J&gt;0$.&#13;
&#13;
A weighted coincidence-based classifier has non-zero generalized error exponent $J$. &#13;
&#13;
The $\ell_2$-norm based classifier has $J=0$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Large scale correlation detection</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This work addresses the problem of correlation detection in a group of elliptically-contoured variables, when the number p of variates greatly exceeds the number n of observed samples. We exploit the properties inherent to the Z-score representation of the data set to devise two different decision tests, whose performances are assessed upper bounding the respective error probabilities. The results specifically apply to the asymptotic regime where the number of variates p is large, and the number of samples n is finite and fixed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Innovative Approach for Analysing Rank Deficient Covariance Matrices</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The estimation of a covariance matrix from an insufficient amount of data is one of the most common problems in fields as diverse as multivariate statistics, wireless communications, signal processing, biology, learning theory and finance. In \cite{MTS}, a new approach to handle singular covariance matrices was suggested. The main idea was to use dimensionality reduction in conjunction with an average over the unitary matrices. In this paper we continue with this idea and we further consider new innovative approaches that show considerable improvements with respect to traditional methods such as diagonal loading. One of the methods is called the \emph{Ewens} estimator and uses a randomization of the sample covariance matrix over all the permutation matrices with respect to the Ewens measure. The techniques used to attack this problem are broad and run from random matrix theory to combinatorics.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Corrupted and missing predictors: Minimax bounds for high-dimensional linear regression</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Missing and corrupted data are ubiquitous in many science and engineering domains. We analyze the information-theoretic limits of recovering sparse vectors under various models of corrupted and missing data. In particular, consider a high-dimensional linear regression model y = X beta* + epsilon, where y is the n-dimensional response vector, X is an nxp random design matrix with p &gt;&gt; n and rows distributed i.i.d. as N(0, Sigma_x), beta* is the unknown p-dimensional regression vector, and epsilon ~ N(0, sigma_epsilon^2 I) is independent additive noise. Whereas a traditional approach assumes that the covariates X are fully observed, we assume only that a corrupted version Z is observed. Our main contribution is to establish minimax rates of convergence for estimating beta* in squared l_2-loss, assuming beta* is k-sparse. Our upper and lower bounds in both additive noise and missing data cases scale as k log (p/k) / n, with prefactors depending only on the corruption and/or missing pattern of the data.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Coded Cooperative Data Exchange Problem for General Topologies</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the {\em coded cooperative data exchange problem} for general graphs. In this problem, given a graph $G=(V,E)$ representing clients in a broadcast network, each of which initially hold a (not necessarily disjoint) set of information packets; one wishes to design a communication scheme in which eventually all clients will hold all the packets of the network. Communication is performed in rounds, where in each round a single client broadcasts a single (possibly encoded) information packet to its neighbors in $G$. The objective is to design a broadcast scheme that satisfies all clients with the minimum number of broadcast rounds.&#13;
&#13;
The coded cooperative data exchange problem has seen significant research over the last few years; mostly when the graph $G$ is the complete broadcast graph in which each client is adjacent to all other clients in the network, but also on general topologies, both in the fractional and integral setting. In this work we focus on the integral setting in general undirected topologies $G$. We tie the data exchange problem on $G$ to certain well studied combinatorial properties of $G$ and in such show that solving the problem exactly or even approximately within a multiplicative factor of $\log{|V|}$ is intractable (i.e., NP-Hard). We then turn to study efficient data exchange schemes yielding a number of communication rounds comparable to our intractability result. Our communication schemes do not involve encoding, and in such yield bounds on the {\em coding advantage} in the setting at hand.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Data Exchange Problem with Helpers</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we construct a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the problem where a set of users is interested in gaining access to a common file, but where each has only partial knowledge of the file. We further assume the existence of another set of terminals in the system, called helpers, who are not interested in the common file, but who are willing to help the users. Given that the collective information of all the terminals is sufficient to allow recovery of the entire file, the goal is to minimize the (weighted) sum of bits that these terminals need to exchange over a noiseless public channel in order achieve this goal. Based on established connections to the multi-terminal secrecy problem, our algorithm also implies a polynomial-time method for constructing the largest shared secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. We consider the following side-information settings: (i) side-information in the form of uncoded packets of the file, where the terminals' sideinformation consists of subsets of the file; (ii) side-information in the form of linearly correlated packets, where the terminals have access to linear combinations of the file packets; and (iii) the general setting where the the terminals' side-information has an arbitrary (i.i.d.) correlation structure. We provide a polynomialtime algorithm (in the number of terminals) that finds the optimal rate allocations for these terminals, and then determines an explicit optimal transmission scheme for cases (i) and (ii).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Network Coded Gossip With Correlated Data</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We design and analyze gossip algorithms for networks with correlated data. In these networks, either the data to be distributed, the data already available at the nodes, or both, are correlated. Although coding schemes for correlated data have been studied extensively, the focus has been on characterizing the rate region in static memory-free networks. In a gossip-based scheme, however, nodes communicate among each other by continuously exchanging packets according to some underlying communication model. The main figure of merit in this setting is the stopping time - the time required until nodes can successfully decode. While gossip schemes are practical, distributed and scalable, they have only been studied for uncorrelated data. &#13;
&#13;
We wish to close this gap by providing techniques to analyze network coded gossip in (dynamic) networks with correlated data. We give a clean framework for oblivious network models that applies to a multitude of network and communication scenarios, specify a general setting for distributed correlated data, and give tight bounds on the stopping times of network coded protocols in this wide range of scenarios.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless Networks with Symmetric Demands</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>It has been shown recently that a simple layering principle -- local physical-layer schemes combined with global routing -- can achieve approximately optimal performance in wireless networks. However, this result depends heavily on the assumption of reciprocity of wireless networks, which may be violated due to asymmetric power constraints, directional antennas or frequency-duplexing. In this paper, we show that the approximate optimality continues to hold even for wireless networks modeled as directed graphs as long as there is a symmetric demand constraint: every demand from source $s_i$ to sink $t_i$ at rate $R_i$ has a counterpart demand from source node $t_i$ to sink node $s_i$ at the same rate. This models several practical scenarios including voice calls, video calls, and interactive gaming. We prove this result in the context of several channel models for which good local schemes exist. The key technical contributions are an outer bound based on a Generalized Network Sharing bound for wireless networks and an achievable strategy based on a connection to polymatroidal networks.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Delay-Rate Tradeoff in Ergodic Interference Alignment</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Ergodic interference alignment, as introduced by Nazer et al (NGJV), is a technique that allows high-rate communication in $n$-user interference networks with fast fading. It works by splitting communication across a pair of fading matrices. However, it comes with the overhead of a long time delay until matchable matrices occur: the delay is q^n^2 for field size q. In this paper, we outline two new families of schemes, called JAP and JAP-B, that reduce the expected delay, sometimes at the cost of a reduction in rate from the NGJV scheme. In particular, we give examples of good schemes for networks with few users, and show that in large n-user networks, the delay scales like q^T, where T is quadratic in n for a constant per-user rate and T is constant for a constant sum-rate. We also show that half the single-user rate can be achieved while reducing NGJV's delay from q^n^2 to q^(n-1)(n-2).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Opportunistic Interference Alignment in MIMO Femtocell Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we consider a two-tier MIMO network in the downlink, consisting of a single macrocell base station with multiple transmit antennas coexisting with several closed-access MIMO femtocells. With multiple receive antennas at both the macrocell and femtocell users, we propose an opportunistic interference alignment scheme to design the transmit and receive beamformers in order to mitigate intra and inter-tier interference. Moreover, to reduce the number of macrocell and femtocell users coexisting in the same spectrum, we apply a random spectrum allocation on top of the opportunistic interference alignment scheme. By applying stochastic geometry, we evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme in terms of distribution of received signal-to-interference plus noise ratio. Numerical results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in improving the performance of random MIMO femtocell networks.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Opportunistic Interference Alignment for MIMO IMAC: Effect of User Scaling Over Degrees-of-Freedom</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider a new opportunistic interference alignment (OIA) for the K-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interfering multiple-access channel (IMAC) with time-invariant channel coefficients, where each cell consists of a base station (BS) with M antennas and N mobile stations (MSs) having L antennas each. In this paper, we propose three OIA techniques: antenna selection-based OIA, singular value decomposition (SVD)-based OIA, and vector quantized (codebook-based) OIA. Then, their performance is analyzed in terms of user scaling law required to achieve KS degrees-of-freedom (DoF), where S(&lt;= M) denotes the number of simultaneously transmitting MSs per cell. As our main result, it is shown that the antenna selection-based OIA does not fundamentally change the user scaling required to achieve KS DoF if L is fixed, compared with the single-input multiple-output (SIMO) IMAC case. In contrast, it is shown that the SVD-based OIA can greatly reduce the required user scaling to {SNR}^{(K-1)S-L+1} through optimizing beamforming vectors at each MS. Furthermore, we show that the vector-quantized OIA can achieve the same user scaling as the SVD-based OIA case if the codebook size is beyond a certain value. For the vector-quantized OIA, we analyze a fundamental trade-off between the quantization level (i.e., codebook size) and the required user scaling.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Relay-aided Interference Alignment for MIMO Cellular Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper is concerned with interference alignment for multiple-in multiple-out (MIMO) cellular networks. An enhanced relay-aided interference alignment (eRIA) scheme is proposed. To align the interference, the scaling coefficients at relay is designed carefully and the design criterions of eRIA are given. The achievable degree-of-freedom (DoF) of eRIA is derived. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that eRIA can achieve higher DoF and require less time extensions compared with Suh's scheme [8].</abstract>

        <papertitle>Generalized Distributive Law for ML Decoding of STBCs: Further Results</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The problem of designing good Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) with low maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding complexity has gathered much attention in the literature. All the known low ML decoding complexity techniques utilize the same approach of exploiting either the multigroup decodable or the fast-decodable (conditionally multigroup decodable) structure of a code. We refer to this well known technique of decoding STBCs as \emph{Conditional ML (CML) decoding}. In~\cite{NSR}, we introduced a framework to construct ML decoders for STBCs based on the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) and the Factor-graph based Sum-Product Algorithm, and showed that for two specific families of STBCs, the Toepltiz codes and the Overlapped Alamouti Codes (OACs), the GDL based ML decoders have strictly less complexity than the CML decoders. In this paper, we introduce a `traceback' step to the GDL decoding algorithm of STBCs, which enables roughly $4$ times reduction in the complexity of the GDL decoders proposed in~\cite{NSR}. Utilizing this complexity reduction from `traceback', we then show that for \emph{any STBC} (not just the Toeplitz and Overlapped Alamouti Codes), the GDL decoding complexity is strictly less than the CML decoding complexity. For instance, for any STBC obtained from Cyclic Division Algebras that is not multigroup or conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder provides approximately $12$ times reduction in complexity compared to the CML decoder. Similarly, for the Golden code, which is conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder is only about half as complex as the CML decoder.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Jacobi MIMO Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&#13;
&#13;
In the Jacobi MIMO channel the transfer matrix $H$ is an $m_r \times m_t$ sub-matrix of an $m\times m$ (Haar-distributed) unitary matrix ($m\geq m_t,m_r$). The (squared) singular values of $H$ follow the law of the Jacobi ensemble, one of the classical random matrix ensembles; hence the name of the channel. A motivation to define such a channel comes from multimode/multicore optical fiber communication. It turns out that this model is qualitatively different than the Rayleigh model, leading to interesting practical and theoretical results. This work first evaluates the ergodic capacity of the channel. In the non-ergodic case, it analyzes the outage probability and the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. In the case where $k=m_t+m_r-m &gt; 0$ at least $k$ degrees of freedom are guaranteed not to fade for any channel realization enabling a zero outage probability or infinite diversity order at the corresponding rates. Finally, we discuss the applications in other communication scenarios.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Channel Modelling of MU-MIMO Systems by Quaternionic Free Probability</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper studies the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution and the mutual information of a multiuser MIMO channel with a certain fraction of users experiencing line-of- sight. It shows that the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the channel matrix decomposes into two separate bulks for practically relevant parameter choices and differs very much from the common i.i.d. assumption which induces the quarter circle law. This happens even without antenna correlation at either side of the channel. In order to tackle this problem the paper makes use of recent developments in free probability theory which allow to deal with complex-valued eigenvalue distributions of non-Hermitian matrices by means of quaternions.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Transmission over Arbitrarily Permuted Parallel Gaussian Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We address the problem of communication over arbitrarily permuted parallel Gaussian channels, where the permutation is known only to the receiver. We present a practical transmission scheme, that allows communication over this channel using off-the-shelf codes, in conjunction with linear processing and successive interference cancellation. The scheme is based on the approach of joint matrix triangularization. Explicit precoding matrices are derived for up to six parallel channels.</abstract>

        <abstract>We examine multiple independent sources providing status updates to a monitor through a first-come-first-served M/M/1 queue. We formulate a status-age timeliness metric and find the region of feasible average status ages for a pair of updating sources. In the presence of interfering traffic with a given offered load, we show the existence of an optimal rate at which a source should generate its updates.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Emptying a Wireless Network in Minimum Time</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider N transmitter-receiver pairs that share a wireless channel and we address the problem of obtaining a schedule for activating subsets of these links so as to empty the transmitter queues in minimum time. Our aim is to provide theoretical insights for the optimality characterization of the problem, using both a cross-layer model formulation, which takes into account the effect of interference on achievable transmission rates, as well as a collision-based model, which does not incorporate the physical layer realities into the problem. We present the basic linear programming formulation of the problem and establish that the optimal schedule need not consist of more than N subset activation frames. We then prove that the problem is NP-hard for all reasonable continuous rate functions. Finally, we obtain sufficient and/or necessary conditions for optimality in a number of special cases.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Mixing Time and Temporal Starvation of General CSMA Networks with Multiple Frequency Agility</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Mixing time is a fundamental property for a number of transient behaviors of stochastic processes, particularly, random access in CSMA networks. We use mixing time to characterize temporal starvation, which is a transient phenomenon where links can starve for prolonged periods indefinitely often despite having good stationary throughput. Considering a general CSMA network, we study a fundamental setting with multiple frequency agility, such that more than one frequency channel is available, and a link can transmit on at most one of the frequency channels not occupied by its neighbors. The characterization of throughput in such a setting is challenging, involving a hidden Markov chain of the associated stochastic process. This paper develops new results based on the mixing time of hidden Markov chains to shed light on the temporal starvation. Our analytical results quantify the effect of the number of frequency channels on temporal starvation. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for fast mixing time of the corresponding hidden Markov chain.</abstract>

        <papertitle>From Glauber Dynamics To Metropolis Algorithm: Smaller Delay in Optimal CSMA</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Glauber dynamics, a method of sampling a given probability distribution via a Markov chain, has recently made considerable contribution to the MAC scheduling research, providing a tool to solve a long-standing open issue -- achieving throughput-optimality with light message passing under CSMA. In this paper, we propose a way of reducing delay by studying \emph{generalized} Glauber dynamics parameterized by $\beta \in [0,1]$, ranging from Glauber dynamics ($\beta = 0$) to the Metropolis algorithm ($\beta = 1$). The same stationary distribution is sustained across this generalization, thus maintaining the long-term optimality. However, a different choice of $\beta$ results in a significantly different second-order behavior (or variability) that has large impact on delay, which is hardly captured by the recent research focusing on delay in the large $n$ (the number of nodes) asymptotic. We formally study such second-order behavior and its resulting delay performance, and show that larger $\beta$ achieves smaller delay. Our results provide new insight into how to operate CSMA for large throughput and small delay in real, finite-sized systems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Linear-Programming Decoding of Tanner Codes with Local-Optimality Certificates</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; Given a channel observation $y$ and a codeword $x$, we are interested in a one-sided error test that answers the questions: is $x$ optimal with respect to $y$? is it unique? A positive answer for such a test is called a \emph{certificate} for the optimality of a codeword.&#13;
&#13;
We present new certificates that are based on combinatorial characterization for local-optimality of a codeword in irregular Tanner codes. The certificate is based on weighted normalized trees in computation trees of the Tanner graph. These trees may have any finite height $h$ (even greater than the girth of the Tanner graph). In addition, the degrees of local-code nodes are not restricted to two (i.e., skinny trees). We prove that local-optimality in this new characterization implies ML-optimality and LP-optimality, and show that a certificate can be computed efficiently.&#13;
&#13;
We apply the new local-optimality characterization to regular Tanner codes, and prove lower bounds on the noise thresholds of LP-decoding in MBIOS channels. When the noise is below these lower bounds, the probability that LP-decoding fails decays doubly exponentially in the girth of the Tanner graph.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Hierarchies of Local-Optimality Characterizations in Decoding Tanner Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; Recent developments in decoding Tanner codes with maximum-likelihood certificates are based on a sufficient condition called local optimality. We define hierarchies of locally optimal codewords with respect to two parameters. One parameter is related to the distance of the local codes in Tanner codes. The second parameter is related to the finite number of iterations used in iterative decoding. We show that these hierarchies satisfy inclusion properties as these parameters are increased. In particular, this implies that a codeword that is decoded with a certificate using an iterative decoder after $h$ iterations is decoded with a certificate after $k\cdot h$ iterations, for every integer $k$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Approaching Capacity at High Rates with Iterative Hard-Decision Decoding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A variety of low-density parity-check (LDPC) ensembles have now been observed to approach capacity with message passing decoding. However, all of them use soft (i.e., non-binary) messages and a posteriori probability (APP) decoding of their component codes. In this paper, we analyze iterative hard-decision decoding for a class of spatially-coupled generalized LDPC codes and observe that they can approach capacity in the high-rate regime. These codes can be seen as generalized product codes and are closely related to braided block codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On The Maximum a Posteriori Decoding Thresholds of Multiuser Systems with Erasures</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A fundamental connection between the belief propagation (BP) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding thresholds was derived by Méasson, Montanari, and Urbanke using the area theorem for extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) curves. This connection allows the MAP threshold, for the binary erasure channel, to be evaluated efficiently via an upper bound that can be shown to be tight in some cases. In this paper, a similar analysis is used to extend these results to several multiuser systems, namely a noisy Slepian-Wolf problem and a multiple access channel with erasures. The simplicity of these channel models allows for rigorous analysis and enables the derivation of upper bounds on the MAP thresholds using EXIT area theorems. In some cases, one can also show these bounds are tight. One interesting application is that the MAP thresholds can be compared with the BP thresholds of spatially-coupled codes to verify threshold saturation for the corresponding systems.</abstract>

        <papertitle>An Analytic Upper Bound on T-Complexity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The Titchener T-complexity $C_T$ of a string has applications in, e.g., randomness testing, event detection and similarity comparison. Like the Lempel-Ziv production complexity, the upper bound of $C_T$ is demonstrably not a linear function of the string length. Knowledge of the bound for a given length is however required in order to convert $C_T$ into a measure with linear upper bound such as Titchener's T-information. For this reason, the upper bound of $C_T$ has been investigated before by several authors, with various asymptotic solutions proposed. We present a new analytic closed-form asymptotic upper bound for $C_T$ based on the Hurwitz-Lerch zeta function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Query Computation and Verification of Functions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD.&#13;
&#13;
In the query model of function computation, the values of the variables are revealed sequentially in some order until the value of the function can be determined without error. Given the input distributions and past observations, the problem is to find a query order that minimizes the expected number of queries. Instead of computation, it is often easier to consider function verification, where the objective is to verify a given value of the function. Given that value, the problem is to find an optimal query order. We show that for all symmetric functions of independent binary random variables, the complexity of computation and verification are identical. This provides a simple method of finding the query order for computing many such functions. We also show that if any of the symmetry, independence, and binary conditions are relaxed then there are functions whose expected verification complexity is strictly lower than their expected computation complexity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Fundamental limits on the power consumption of encoding and decoding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We provide fundamental information-theoretic bounds on the required circuit wiring complexity and power consumption for encoding and decoding of error-correcting codes. These bounds hold for all codes and all encoding and decoding algorithms implemented within the paradigm of our VLSI model. This model essentially views computation on a 2-D VLSI circuit as a computation on a network of connected nodes. The bounds are derived based on analyzing information flow in the circuit. They are then used to show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between the transmit and encoding/decoding power, and that the total (transmit + encoding + decoding) power must diverge to infinity at least as fast as cube-root of log (1/Pe), where Pe is the average block-error probability. On the other hand, for bounded transmit-power schemes, the total power must diverge to infinity at least as fast as square-root of log (1/Pe) due to the burden of encoding/decoding.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Tractable Bayesian Social Learning on Trees</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study a model of Bayesian agents in social networks who learn from the actions of their neighbors. Agents attempt to iteratively estimate an unknown &quot;state of the world&quot; s from initial private signals, and the past actions of their neighbors in the network. We investigate the computational problem the agents face in implementing the (myopic) Bayesian decision rule. When private signals are independent conditioned on s, and when the social network graph is a tree, we provide a new &quot;dynamic cavity algorithm&quot; for the agents' calculations, with computational effort that is exponentially lower than what is currently known.&#13;
&#13;
We use this algorithm to perform the first numerical simulations of Bayesian agents on networks with hundreds of nodes, and observe rapid learning of s in some settings.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Learning Minimal Latent Directed Information Trees</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD-We propose a framework for learning the structure of a minimal latent tree with an associated discrepancy measure. Specifically, we apply this algorithm to recover the minimal latent directed information tree on a mixture of set of observed and unobserved random processes. Directed information trees are a new type of probabilistic graphical model based on directed information that represent the casual dynamics among random processes in a stochastic systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that recovers these type of latent graphical models where samples are available only from a subset of processes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Learning Markov Graphs Up To Edit Distance</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper presents a rate distortion approach to Markov graph learning. It provides lower bounds on the number of samples required for any algorithm to learn the Markov graph structure of a probability distribution, up to edit distance. We first prove a general result for any probability distribution, and then specialize it for Ising and Gaussian models. In particular, for both Ising and Gaussian models on $p$ variables with degree at most $d$, we show that at least $\Omega((d-\frac{s}{p})\log p)$ samples are required for any algorithm to learn the graph structure up to edit distance $s$. Our bounds represent a strong converse; i.e., we show that for a lower number of samples, the probability of error goes to $1$ as the problem size increases. These results show that substantial gains in sample complexity may not be possible without paying a significant price in edit distance error.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Passive Learning of the Interference Graph of a Wireless Network</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A key challenge in wireless networking is the management of interference between transmissions. Identifying which transmitters interfere with each other is crucial. Complicating this task is the fact that the topology of wireless networks can change from time to time, and so the identification process may need to be carried out on a regular basis. Injecting active probing traffic to assess interference can lead to unacceptable overhead, and so this paper focuses on interference estimation based on passive traffic monitoring in networks that use the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) protocol. A graph is used to represent the interference in the network, where the nodes represent transmitters and edges represent interference between pairs of transmitters. We investigate the problem of learning the graph structure based on passive observations of network traffic transmission patterns and information about successes or failures in transmissions. Previous work has focused on algorithms and validations in small testbed networks. This paper focuses on the scaling behavior of such methods which is unaddressed in prior work. In particular we establish bounds on the minimum observation period required to identify the interference graph reliably. The main results are expressed in terms of the total number of nodes $n$ and the maximum number of interfering transmitters per node (i.e., maximum node degree) $d$. The effects of hidden terminal interference (i.e., interference not detectable via carrier sensing) on the observation time requirement are also quantified. We show that it is necessary and sufficient that the observation period grows like $d^2 log(n)$, and we propose a practical algorithm that reliably identifies the graph from this length of observation. We conclude that the observation requirements scale quite mildly with network size, and that the networks with sparse interference patterns can be more rapidly identified than those with dense interference patterns.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Information Theory for DNA Sequencing: Part I: A Basic Model</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>DNA sequencing is the basic workhorse of modern day biology and medicine. Shotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short fragments called reads are extracted from the DNA sequence, and these reads are assembled to reconstruct the original sequence. By drawing an analogy between the DNA sequencing problem and the classic communication problem, we define an information theoretic notion of {\em sequencing} capacity. This is the maximum number of DNA base pairs that can be resolved reliably per read, and provides a fundamental limit to the performance that can be achieved by {\em any} assembly algorithm. We compute the sequencing capacity explicitly for a simple statistical model of the DNA sequence and the read process.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Information Content in Sorting Algorithms</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Sorting algorithms like MergeSort or BubbleSort order items according to some criterion. Whereas the computational complexities of the various sorting algorithms are well understood, their behavior with noisy input data or unreliable algorithm operations is less known. In this work, we present an information-theoretic approach to quantifying the information content of algorithms. We exemplify the significance of this approach by comparing different algorithms w.r.t to both informativeness and stability. For the first time, the amount of order information that a sorting algorithm can extract in uncertain settings is measured quantitatively. Such measurements not only render a principled comparison of algorithms possible, but also guide the design and construction of algorithms that provide the maximum information. Results for five popular sorting algorithms are illustrated, giving new insights about the amount of ordering information achievable for them. For example, in noisy settings, BubbleSort can outperform MergeSort in the number of bits that can be effectively extracted per comparison made.</abstract>

        <papertitle>String reconciliation with unknown edit distance</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of reconciling two remote strings of arbitrary and unknown similarity using minimum communication, which is at the core of some important problems in networking, cryptography, genetic engineering, and even linguistics. Though this problem is efficiently convertible into a set reconciliation instance, for which efficient solutions exist, this conversion may introduce ambiguity in the decoding process, which may require significant communication and computational resources to resolve. We leverage some recent advances in efficient unique decodability of strings decoding ambiguity, and thus pave the way for a practical implementation of this string reconciler. For certain random strings and in some ideal cases, our approach reconciles two length $n$ strings that differ in $\alpha$ edits (with $\alpha$ not known a priori) using $O \left(\alpha \log^2(n) \right)$ communication.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Modeling Biological Circuits with Urn Functions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Motivated to understand the role of randomness in biological computation, we study a class of urn models that are characterized by urn functions. At each step, one ball is randomly sampled according to an urn function and replaced with a different colored ball. This process is repeated until the urn contains a single color, at which point the process halts. Such an urn can be thought of as a random switch; depending on the initial ball colors and the urn function, the urn population has some probability of converging to any of the initial ball colors. We find that these probabilities have surprisingly simple closed-form solutions and also derive expressions for the switching time.&#13;
&#13;
We demonstrate the application of such urn models to biological systems by deriving the urn function for the genetic network controlling the lysis-lysogeny decision in the Lambda phage virus. By applying our results to this urn, we derive an intriguing hypothesis on the role of dimers in genetic switches. Many open questions exist on further generalizations of such urn models and their applications to the understanding of randomness and biological computation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Allocations for Heterogenous Distributed Storage</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study the problem of storing a data object in a set of data nodes that fail independently with given probabilities. Our problem is a natural generalization of a homogenous storage allocation problem where all the nodes had the same reliability and is naturally motivated for peer-to-peer and cloud storage systems with different types of nodes. Assuming optimal erasure coding (MDS), the goal is to find a storage allocation (i.e, how much to store in each node) to maximize the probability of successful recovery. This problem turns out to be a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. In this work we introduce an approximation framework based on large deviation inequalities and convex optimization. We propose two approximation algorithms and study the asymptotic performance of the resulting allocations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Codes Can Reduce Queueing Delay in Data Centers</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we quantify how much codes can reduce the data retrieval latency in storage systems. By combining a simple linear code with a novel request scheduling algorithm, which we call Blocking-one Scheduling (BoS), we show analytically that it is possible to reduce data retrieval delay by up to $17\%$ over currently popular replication-based strategies. Although in this work we focus on a simplified setting where the storage system stores a single content, the methodology developed can be applied to more general settings with multiple contents. The results also offer insightful guidance to the design of storage systems in data centers and content distribution networks.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Locally Repairable Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. One main challenge in the design of distributed storage codes is the {\it Exact Repair Problem}: if a node storing encoded information fails, to maintain the same level of reliability, we need to exactly regenerate what was lost in a new node. A major open problem in this area has been the design of codes that {\it i)} admit exact and low cost repair of nodes and {\it ii)} have arbitrarily high data rates. In this paper, we focus on codes that are optimized for the metric of {\it repair locality}. Locality corresponds to the the number of disk accesses required during a node repair. Under this metric we characterize an information theoretic trade-off that binds together locality, code distance, and storage cost per node. We use a ``locality aware'' flow graph gadget to show the achievability of this fundamental limit. Finally, we present the {\it first} family of locality-optimal {\it Erasure Codes}.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Linear Codes with a Local-Error-Correction Property</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Motivated by applications to distributed storage, Gopalan \textit{et al} recently introduced the interesting notion of infromation-symbol locality in a linear code. By this it is meant that each message symbol appears in a parity-check equation associated with small Hamming weight, thereby enabling recovery of the message symbol by examining a small number of other code symbols. This notion is extended to the case when all code symbols, not just the message symbols, are covered by such ``local'' parity. In this paper, we extend the results of Gopalan et. al. so as to permit recovery of an erased code symbol even in the presence of errors in local parity symbols. We present tight bounds on the minimum distance of such codes and exhibit codes that are optimal with respect to the local error-correction property. A comparison with concatenated codes is also made.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless Device-to-Device Communications with Distributed Caching</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We introduce a novel wireless device-to-device (D2D) collaboration architecture that exploits distributed storage of popular content to enable frequency reuse. We identify a fundamental conflict between collaboration distance and interference and show how to optimize the transmission power to maximize frequency reuse. Our analysis depends on the user content request statistics which are modeled by a Zipf distribution. Our main result is a closed form expression of the optimal collaboration distance as a function of the content reuse distribution parameters. We show that if the Zipf exponent of the content reuse distribution is greater than 1, it is possible to have a number of D2D interference-free collaboration pairs that scales linearly in the number of nodes. If the Zipf exponent is smaller than 1, we identify the best possible scaling in the number of D2D collaborating links. Surprisingly, a very simple distributed caching policy achieves the optimal scaling behavior and therefore there is no need to centrally coordinate what each node is caching.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Capacity for MIMO Gaussian Interference Channels With Generally Strong and Noisy Interference</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>There exist vector Gaussian interference channels that may not satisfy the strong interference condition but for which the capacity can still be achieved by jointly decoding the signal and the interference. This kind of interference is called generally strong interference. Sufficient conditions for a vector Gaussian interference channel to have generally strong interference are derived. The sum-rate capacity and the boundary points of the capacity region are also determined.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, new sufficient conditions for a vector Gaussian interference channel to achieve the sum-rate capacity by treating interference as noise are derived, which generalize all the existing results. Some boundary points on the capacity region of a vector Z interference channel under noisy interference are also determined to be achieved by treating interference as noise.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Han-Kobayashi Region for a Class of Gaussian Interference Channels with Mixed Interference</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&#13;
&#13;
A simple encoding scheme based on Sato's non-naive frequency division is proposed for a class of Gaussian interference channels with mixed interference. The achievable region is shown to be equivalent to that of Costa's noiseberg region for the Gaussian Z interference channel. This allows for an indirect proof that this simple achievable rate region is indeed equivalent to the Han-Kobayashi (HK) region with Gaussian input and with time sharing for this class of Gaussian interference channels with mixed interference.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Simple transmission strategies for interference channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we investigate performances of simple transmission strategies. We first consider two user SISO Gaussian symmetric interference channel (IC) for which Etkin, Tse and Wang proposed a scheme (ETW scheme) which achieves one bit gap to the capacity. We compare performance of point-to-point (p2p) codes with that of the ETW scheme in practical range of transmitter power. It turns out that p2p coding scheme performs better or as nearly good as the ETW scheme. Next, we consider K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. We define interference regimes for K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC and provide closed-form characterization of the symmetric rate achieved by the p2p scheme and the ETW scheme. Using this characterization, we evaluate performances of simple strategies with K=3, and show the similar trend to two user case.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Two-way Interference Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider two-way interference channels (ICs) where forward and backward channels are ICs but not necessarily the same. We first consider a scenario where there are only two forward messages and feedback is offered through the backward IC for aiding forward-message transmission. For a linear deterministic model of this channel, we develop inner and outer bounds that match for a wide range of channel parameters. We find that the backward IC can be more efficiently used for feedback purpose rather than if it were used for sending its own independent backward messages. As a consequence, we show that feedback can provide a net increase in capacity even if feedback cost is taken into consideration. Moreover we extend this to a more general scenario with two additional independent backward messages, from which we find that interaction can provide an arbitrarily large capacity increase.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A New Outer Bound on the Capacity Region of Gaussian Interference Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The best known outer bound on the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian interference channel is given as the intersection of regions of genie-aided outer bounds, in which a genie provides extra side information to the receivers. In this paper, we present a new outer bound that does not resort to a genie-aided channel but make use of auxiliary random variables. In order to obtain such bound, we introduce a conditional version of the worst additive noise lemma. The new bound is shown to be tighter than genie-aided bounds for certain range of parameters.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Sphere Decoding Complexity of High Rate Multigroup ML Decodable STBCs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A Space-Time Block Code (STBC) is said to be multigroup ML decodable if the information symbols encoded by it can be partitioned into two or more groups, such that each group of symbols can be ML decoded independently of the other symbol groups. In this paper, we show that the upper triangular matrix $R$ encountered during the sphere decoding of a linear dispersion STBC can be rank-deficient even when the rate of the code is less than the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas. We then show that all known families of high rate (rate greater than $1$) multigroup ML decodable codes have rank-deficient $R$ matrix, even when the rate is less than the number of transmit and receive antennas, and this rank-deficiency problem arises only when the number of receive antennas is strictly less than the number of transmit antennas. Unlike the codes with full-rank $R$ matrix, the average sphere decoding complexity of the STBCs whose $R$ matrix is rank-deficient is polynomial in the constellation size, and hence is high. We derive the sphere decoding complexity of most of the known high rate multigroup ML decodable codes, and show that for each code, the complexity is a decreasing function of the number of receive antennas.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Feedback-aided complexity reductions in ML and Lattice decoding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&#13;
&#13;
The work analyzes the computational-complexity savings that a single bit of feedback can provide in the computationally intense setting of non-ergodic MIMO communications. Specifically we derive upper bounds on the feedback-aided complexity exponent required for the broad families of ML-based and lattice based decoders to achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing behavior. The bounds reveal a complexity that is reduced from being exponential in the number of codeword bits, to being at most exponential in the rate. Finally the derived savings are met by practically constructed ARQ schemes, as well as simple lattice designs, decoders, and computation-halting policies.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Time-Varying Space-Only Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD Multiple antennas are used to increase reliability and bit rate for a given bandwidth. For a fixed transmission rate, discrete input alphabets and no channel state information at the transmitter, optimal space-time codes (STCs) achieving both gains (full rate and full diversity) are well known. However, the complexity of maximum likelihood decoding increases exponentially with the number of space and time dimensions of the STC. Despite praiseworthy efforts to reduce the decoding complexity, optimal STCs are not used in practice in the case of more than two transmit antennas because of complexity reasons. It is generally accepted that reducing the dimension of the STC leads to a reduced diversity order. We show that this is not true for coded communication, assuming the presence of an outer error-correcting code with any coding rate. We propose a new class of full-rate full-diversity STCs; more specifically, time-varying space-only codes. This new class is referred to as EMI codes. Full diversity is proven in terms of outage probability, for the case where the number of receive antennas is larger than or equal to the number of transmit antennas, and is numerically verified in terms of outage and word error probability using LDPC codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Class of Iterated Fast Decodable Space-Time Codes for 2^n Tx Antennas</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We present an iterative construction of algebraic space-time codes. Starting from a division algebra D, we show how to embedd it into a larger ring A(D) and give conditions for A(D) to be a new division algebra. Starting from a quaternion division algebra, we thus obtain a sequence $\Dc_1 \subset \D_2 \subset \ldots$ of division algebras, each of which can be used as an underlying structure to build a space-time code. Furthermore, the iteration step is done in a way so that fast-decodability of the original code is preserved. We illustrate our technique by creating an iterative version of the Silver code.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Space-Time MIMO Multicasting</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Multicasting is the general method of conveying the same information to multiple users over a broadcast channel. In this work, the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel is considered, with several users and any number of antennas at each transmission link. A &quot;closed loop&quot; scenario is assumed, for which a practical capacity-achieving multicast scheme is constructed. In the proposed scheme, linear modulation is carried over time and space together, which allows to transform the problem into that of transmission over equal-gain parallel scalar channels. Over these channels, off-the-shelf fixed-rate AWGN codes can be used to approach capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Approximating the Timely Throughput of Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; In this paper we consider the down link of a heterogeneous wireless network with $N$ Access Points (AP's) and $M$ clients, where each client is connected to several out-of-band AP's, and requests delay-sensitive traffic (e.g., real-time video). We adopt the framework of Hou, Borkar, and Kumar, and study the maximum total timely throughput of the network, denoted by $C_{T^3}$, which is the maximum average number of packets delivered successfully before their deadline. We propose a deterministic relaxation of the problem, which converts the problem to a network with deterministic delays in each link. We show that the additive gap between the capacity of the relaxed problem, denoted by $C_{det}$, and $C_{T^3}$ is bounded by $2\sqrt{N(C_{det}+N/4)}$, which is asymptotically negligible compared to $C_{det}$, when the network is operating at high-throughput regime. Moreover, using LP rounding methods we prove that the relaxed problem can be approximated in polynomial time with additive gap of $N$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Wireless Downloading Delay under Proportional Fair Scheduling with Coupled Service and Requests: An Approximated Analysis</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We propose a method for approximating the downloading delay for the downlink of a cellular system reminiscent of LTE (based on OFDMA), where users are randomly distributed in a cell, and the channel gain is formed by a distance dependent component (path loss), constant in time and frequency, and a time-frequency selective small-scale fading component, i.i.d. across the OFDMA resource allocation blocks. The proposed method yields an approximation of the user downloading delay cdf, through the solution of a system of fixed-point equations. It provides accurate results when the traffic demand is large</abstract>

        <papertitle>Delay-Optimal Buffered Decode-and-Forward for Two-hop Networks with Random Link Connectivity</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider delay-optimal link selection for a two-hop half-duplex network with i.i.d. on-off fading. Both the source node and the relay node are equipped with infinite buffers and have exogenous bit arrivals. We consider delay-optimal link selection to minimize the average bit delay subject to a half-duplex constraint. To solve the problem, we first introduce a virtual continuous time system (VCTS) to approximate the actual discrete time system (ADTS) and solve the delay-minimization problem in the VCTS using dynamic programming and calculus techniques. We show that the solution for the VCTS is asymptotically optimal in the ADTS. The derived solution has a simple closed-form expression and does not require knowledge of the source statistics. Finally, using renewal and random walk theories, we analyze the delay performance in the ADTS by exploiting the specific structure in the solution.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Delay-Exponent of Delay-Universal Compress-and-Forward Relaying</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study detect-and-forward relaying for delay-universal transmission over a three-terminal network. An important performance measure of delay-universal transmission is the delay-exponent. Two achievable bounds of the delay-exponent are derived. The delay-exponent achieved by a suboptimal message-truncating decoder is inferior to that achieved by an approximate maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder in most cases. However, ML decoding is not analytical tractable when source compression is employed at the relay terminal. Therefore, the system with the message-truncating decoder performs better when signal compression is essential, for e.g. when the source-relay link is non-symmetric and the relay-destination link is noisy.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Playback Delay in Streaming Communication</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of minimizing playback delay in streaming over a packet erasure channel with fixed bandwidth. When packets have to be played in order, the expected delay inherently grows with time. We analyze two cases, namely no feedback and instantaneous feedback. We find that in both cases the delay grows logarithmically with the elapsed time since the start of transmission, and we evaluate the growth constant, i.e. the pre-log term, as a function of the transmission bandwidth (relative to the source bandwidth). The growth constant with feedback is strictly better that the one without, but they have the same asymptotic value in the limit of infinite bandwidth.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Jar Decoding: LDPC Coding Theorems for Binary Input Memoryless Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Recently, a new coding rule called jar decoding was proposed, under which the decoder first forms a set of suitable size, called a jar, consisting of sequences from the channel input alphabet considered to be closely related to the received channel output sequence, and then takes any codeword from the jar as the estimate of the transmitted codeword. In this paper, we show that under jar decoding, the analysis of low density parity check (LDPC) codes is much easier compared to maximum a posteriori (MAP) or maximum likelihood (ML) and Belief Propagation (BP) decoding, and new LDPC coding theorems, which have not been proved under ML or BP decoding to our best knowledge, can be established. Specifically, it is proved that LDPC codes with any variable node degree distributions $L(z^k)$ and check node degree distributions $R(z^k)$ can approach the capacity, with diminishing bit error probability, of any binary input memoryless channel with uniform capacity-achieving distribution as $k$ increases. Moreover, simulation shows an interesting connection between jar decoding and BP decoding, i.e., BP decoding can be regarded as one of many ways to pick up a codeword from the jar for LDPC codes when it succeeds in outputting a codeword.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Two Stage Selective Averaging LDPC Decoding</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Low density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a class of linear block codes that are decoded by running belief propagation (BP) algorithm or log-likelihood ratio belief propagation (LLR-BP) over the factor graph of the code. One of the disadvantages of LDPC codes is the onset of an error floor at high values of signal to noise ratio caused by trapping sets. In this paper, we propose a two stage decoder to deal with different types of trapping sets. Oscillating trapping sets are taken care by the first stage of the decoder and the elementary trapping sets are handled by the second stage of the decoder. Simulation results on the regular PEG (504,252,3,6) code and the irregular PEG (1024,518,15,8) code shows that the proposed two stage decoder performs significantly better than the standard decoder.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Quantized Min-Sum Decoders with Low Error Floor for LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The error floor phenomenon observed with LDPC codes and their graph-based, iterative, message-passing (MP) decoders is commonly attributed to the existence of error-prone substructures -- variously referred to as near codewords, trapping sets, or absorbing sets -- in a Tanner graph representation of the code. Many approaches have been proposed to lower the error floor by designing new LDPC codes with fewer such substructures or by modifying the decoding algorithm. In this paper, we show that the source of the error floors observed in the literature may be the message quantization rule used in the iterative decoder implementation. We then propose a new quantization method to overcome the limitations of standard quantization rules. Performance simulation results for two LDPC codes commonly found to have high error floors when used with the fixed-point min-sum decoder and its variants demonstrate the validity of our findings and the effectiveness of the proposed quantization algorithm.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Enhancing the Error Correction of Finite Alphabet Iterative Decoders via Adaptive Decimation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs) for LDPC codes were recently shown to be capable of surpassing the Belief Propagation (BP) decoder in the error floor region on the Binary Symmetric channel (BSC). More recently, the technique of decimation which involves fixing the values of certain bits during decoding, was proposed for FAIDs in order to make them more amenable to analysis while maintaining their good performance. In this paper, we show how decimation can be used adaptively to further enhance the guaranteed error correction capability of FAIDs that are already good on a given code. The new adaptive decimation scheme proposed has marginally added complexity but can significantly improve the slope of the error floor performance of a particular FAID. We describe the adaptive decimation scheme particularly for 7-level FAIDs which propagate only 3-bit messages and provide numerical results for column-weight three codes. Analysis suggests that the failures of the new decoders are linked to stopping sets of the code.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Selecting Two-Bit Bit Flipping Algorithms for Collective Error Correction</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>A class of two-bit bit flipping algorithms for decoding low-density parity-check codes over the binary symmetric channel was proposed in [1]. Initial results showed that decoders which employ a group of these algorithms operating in parallel can offer low error floor decoding for high-speed applications. As the number of two-bit bit flipping algorithms is large, designing such a decoder is not a trivial task. In this paper, we describe a procedure to select collections of algorithms that work well together. This procedure relies on a recursive process which enumerates error configurations that are uncorrectable by a given algorithm. The error configurations uncorrectable by a given algorithm form its trapping set profile. Based on their trapping set profiles, algorithms are selected so that in parallel, they can correct a fixed number of errors with high probability.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Maximum Distance Separable Symbol-Pair Code</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study (symbol-pair) codes for symbol-pair read channels introduced recently by Cassuto and Blaum (2010). A Singleton-type bound on symbol-pair codes is established and infinite families of optimal symbol-pair codes are constructed. These codes are maximum distance separable (MDS) in the sense that they meet the Singleton-type bound. In contrast to classical codes, where all known $q$-ary MDS codes have length $O(q)$, we show that $q$-ary MDS symbol-pair codes can have length $\Omega(q^2)$. We also construct equidistant cyclic MDS symbol-pair codes from Mendelsohn designs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Decoding of Cyclic Codes over Symbol-Pair Read Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Symbol-pair read channels (the outputs of the read process are pairs of consecutive symbols) were recently studied by Cassuto and Blaum. This new paradigm is motivated by the limitations of the reading process in high density data storage systems. They studied error correction in this new paradigm, specifically, the relationship between the minimum Hamming distance of an error correcting code on the original (single symbol) information and the so called pair-distance (the corresponding Hamming distance on the pairs). It was proved that using linear cyclic codes one can have a minimum pair distance of at least $d_{H} +3$ where $d_H$ is the minimum Hamming distance of the original information.&#13;
&#13;
Our main contribution is proving that for a given linear cyclic code with a minimum Hamming distance $d_H$ the minimum pair distance is at least $d_{H} +\left\lceil{\frac{d_H}{2}}\right\rceil.$ We also describe decoding algorithms that are based on the original codes and are utilizing the larger pair distance. In addition, we consider the case where a read channel output is a prescribed number (larger than 2) of consecutive symbols and provide some generalizations of our results. We note that the symbol-pair read channel problem is a special case of the sequence reconstruction problem that was introduced by Levenshtein.</abstract>

&#13;
A new approach to bound the minimum distance of q-ary cyclic codes is presented. The connection to the BCH and the Hartmann--Tzeng bound is formulated and it is shown that for several cases an improvement is achieved.&#13;
&#13;
We associate a second cyclic code to the original one and bound its minimum distance in terms of parameters of the associated code.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Weight Distribution of Some Cyclic Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, for an odd prime $p$ such that $p\equiv 3\bmod 4$, odd $n$, and $d=(p^n+1)/(p^k+1)+(p^n-1)/2$ with $k|n$, the value distribution of the exponential sum $S(a,b)$ when $a$ and $b$ run through $F_{p^n}$ is calculated. The weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code $\mathcal{C}$ over $F_p$ with the length $L=p^n-1$ and the dimension ${\rm dim}_{F_p}\mathcal{C}=2n$ is also derived. Our result generalizes the case in \cite{Xia}.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Self-Dual Repeated Root Cyclic and Negacyclic Codes Over Finite Fields</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper we investigate repeated root cyclic and negacyclic codes of length p^rm over F_p^s with (m,p)=1. In the case p odd, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the existence of negacyclic self-dual codes. In the special case when m=2m' with m' odd, we characterize the codes in terms of their generator polynomials. This provides simple conditions on the existence of self-dual negacyclic codes. It also generalizes the results of Dinh. We also answer an open problem concerning the number of self-dual cyclic codes given by Jia et al.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Approximate Feedback Capacity of the Gaussian Multicast Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We characterize the capacity region to within log (2(M-1)) bits/s/Hz for the M-transmitter K-receiver Gaussian multicast channel with feedback where each receiver wishes to decode every message from the M transmitters. Extending Cover-Leung's achievable scheme intended for (M,K)=(2,1), we show that this generalized scheme achieves the cutset-based outer bound within log (2(M-1)) bits per transmitter for all channel parameters. In contrast to the capacity in the non-feedback case, the feedback capacity improves upon the naive intersection of the feedback capacities of $K$ individual multiple access channels. We find that feedback provides a multiplicative gain at high signal-to-noise ratios as was shown in the Gaussian interference channel. To complement the results, we establish the exact feedback capacity of the Avestimehr-Diggavi-Tse deterministic model, from which we make the observation that feedback can also be beneficial for function computation.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A sequential transmission scheme for unifilar finite-state channels with feedback based on posterior matching</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The capacity of unifilar finite-state channels with feedback has been recently derived in the form of a single-letter expression and it has been evaluated analytically for a number of channels of interest, such as the trapdoor channel and the Ising channel with feedback. In this paper, we investigate capacity-achieving transmission schemes for this class of channels. These schemes are inspired by the posterior matching scheme (PMS) introduced for memoryless channels with feedback. The transmission scheme is proven to achieve the channel capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Optimal Selective Feedback Policies for Opportunistic Beamforming Under Peak Feedback Constraints</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Opportunistic beamforming (OBF) is a well-known communication technique that utilizes partial channel state information (CSI) to obtain multiuser diversity gains in the downlink. We focus on the structure of the optimal homogenous threshold feedback policy that maximizes the ergodic downlink sum-rate for OBF under a peak feedback load constraint, which we model by using a multi-packet reception model for the uplink. We solve the resulting quasi-convex optimization problem by obtaining a formula for the sum-rate maximizing feedback probability. While providing insights on the implications of our results in practical systems, we also illustrate the tradeoff between feedback and rate by obtaining the Pareto optimal boundary between feasible and infeasible feedback-rate pairs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Rate-compatible Sphere-packing Analysis of Feedback Coding with Limited Retransmissions</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Recent work by Polyanskiy et al. and Chen et al. has excited new interest in using feedback to approach capacity with low latency. Polyanskiy showed that feedback identifying the first symbol at which decoding is successful allows capacity to be approached with surprisingly low latency. This paper uses Chen's rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP) analysis to study what happens when symbols must be transmitted in packets, as with a traditional hybrid ARQ system, and limited to relatively few (six or fewer) incremental transmissions. Numerical optimizations find the series of progressively growing cumulative block lengths that enable RCSP to approach capacity with the minimum possible latency. RCSP analysis shows that five incremental transmissions are sufficient to achieve 92% of capacity with an average block length of fewer than 101 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB. The RCSP analysis provides a decoding error trajectory that specifies the decoding error rate for each cumulative block length. Though RCSP is an idealization, an example tail-biting convolutional code matches the RCSP decoding error trajectory and achieves 91% of capacity with an average block length of 102 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB. We also show how RCSP analysis can be used in cases where packets have deadlines associated with them (leading to an outage probability).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Completely Decoupled Space-Time Block Codes with Low-Rate Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we propose a class of full diversity rate one space-time block codes (STBC) satisfying the generalized orthogonal constraint (GOC). First an explicit construction of completely decoupled STBC is proposed to obtain a rate one STBC with linear decoding complexity for any number of transmit antennas. Then we propose an adaptation strategy for the codes to achieve full diversity by utilizing partial phase information of the channel obtained via a feedback link. With a few feedback bits, the proposed rate one code has full diversity while reserving the same decoding complexity as Orthogonal STBCs. Moreover, the full diversity can be still achieved even if the simple zero-forced decoding is used at the receiver.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Reliability Functions for Single-Message Unequal Error Protection</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Single-message unequal error protection (UEP) is a channel coding scheme that protects one special message differently from other (regular) messages. This induces three different types of errors in the system: 1) miss (where we decode the special codeword as a regular codeword), 2) false alarm (where we decode a regular codeword as the special codeword), and 3) decoding error (where we decode a regular codeword to another regular codeword). In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of single-message UEP, in the context of discrete memoryless channel (DMC) without feedback. Similar to the work by Borade et. al., we use error exponents as the performance metric and discuss maximizing the miss error exponent and the false alarm error exponent respectively. We characterize the miss reliability function, i.e., the optimal miss error exponent as a function of communication rate, and provide inner and outer bounds for the false alarm reliability function. Our work generalizes results in Borade et. al. from at rates close to capacity to all rates up to capacity, and our results on the miss error exponent can be viewed as the DMC counterpart of Nazer et al., where the miss error exponent of single-message UEP over the AWGN channel is investigated.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Error Exponents of Optimum Erasure/List and Ordinary Decoding for Channels with Side Information</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD In this work we analyze achievable random coding error exponents pertaining to erasure/list decoding for channels with side information present at the transmitter. The analysis is carried out using the optimal decoding rule proposed by Forney. A key ingredient in the analysis is the evaluation of moments of a certain distance enumerator. This approach leads to a new exponentially tight bounds. These results are obtained by exploring a random binning code with conditionally constant composition codewords previously proposed by Moulin and Wang. Later, these results are used to obtain an achievable random coding error exponent for ordinary decoding.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Extremality Properties for Gallager's Random Coding Exponent</papertitle>

        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot;&#13;
&#13;
We describe certain extremality properties for Gallager's reliability function $E_0$ for binary input symmetric DMCs. In particular, we show that amongst such DMC's whose $E_0(\rho_1)$ has a given value for a given $\rho_1$, the BEC and BSC have the largest and smallest value of the derivative of $E_0(\rho_2)$ for any $\rho_2\geq\rho_1$. As the random coding exponent is obtained by tracing the map $\rho\to(E_0'(\rho), E_0(\rho)-\rho E_0'(\rho))$ this conclusion includes as a special case the results of \cite{6034105}. Furthermore, we show that amongst channels $W$ with a given value of $E_0(\rho)$ for a given $\rho$ the BEC and BSC are the most and least polarizing under Ar{\i}kan's polar transformations in the sense that their polar transforms $W^+$ and $W^-$ has the largest and smallest difference in their $E_0$ values.</abstract>

        <abstract>(THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD) We provide a refinement of the sphere-packing bound for constant composition codes over discrete memoryless channels that improves the pre-factor in front of the exponential term. The order of our pre-factor is $O(N^{-\frac{1}{2}\left( 1+\rho_{R}^{\ast}\right)})$, where $\rho_{R}^{\ast}$ is related to the slope of the sphere-packing exponent and $N$ is the blocklength.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Decoding Error Exponent of Gaussian Channel with Noisy Feedback: Nonexponential Number of Messages</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>For information transmission a discrete time channel with independent additive Gaussian noise is used. There is also feedback channel with independent additive Gaussian noise, and the transmitter observes without delay all outputs of the forward channel via that feedback channel. Transmission of nonexponential number of messages is considered and the achievable decoding error exponent for such a combination of channels is investigated. It is shown that for any finite noise in the feedback channel the achievable error exponent is better than similar error exponent of the no-feedback channel. Method of transmission/decoding used in the paper strengthens the earlier method used by authors for BSC. In particular, for small feedback noise, it allows to increase the gain up to 30¥% (instead of 14.3¥% earlier for BSC).</abstract>

        <papertitle>Collective Sensing-Capacity of Bacteria Populations</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The design of biological networks using bacteria as the basic elements of the network is initially motivated by a phenomenon called quorum sensing. Through quorum sensing, each bacterium performs sensing the medium and communicating it to others via molecular communication. As a result, bacteria can orchestrate and act collectively and perform tasks impossible otherwise. In this paper, we consider a population of bacteria as a single node in a network. In our version of biological communication networks, such a node would communicate with one another via molecular signals. As a first step toward such networks, this paper focuses on the study of the transfer of information to the population (i.e., the node) by stimulating it with a concentration of special type of a molecules signal. These molecules trigger a chain of processes inside each bacteria that results in a final output in the form of light or fluorescence. Each stage in the process adds noise to the signal carried to the next stage. Our objective is to measure (compute) the maximum amount of information that we can transfer to the node. This can be viewed as the collective sensing capacity of the node. The molecular concentration, which carries the information, is the input to the node, which should be estimated by observing the produced light as the output of the node (i.e., the entire population of bacteria forming the node. The molecules are trapped in the bacteria receptors forming complexes inside the bacteria which affect the genes responsible for producing the light. We focus on the noise caused by the random process of trapping molecules at the receptors as well as the variation of outputs of different bacteria in the node. The optimal input distribution to maximize the mutual information between the output of the node, e.g., light, and the applied molecule concentration is derived. Further, the capacity variation with the number of bacteria in the node and the number of receptors per bacteria is obtained. Finally, we investigated the collective sensing capability of the node when a specific form of molecular signaling concentration (which resembles M-ary modulation) is used. The achievable sensing capacity and the corresponding error probabilities were obtained for such practical signaling techniques.</abstract>

&#13;
How neurons in the cerebral cortex process and transmit information is a long-standing question in systems neuroscience. To analyze neuronal activity from an information-energy efficiency standpoint, Berger and Levy calculated the maximum Shannon mutual information transfer per unit of energy expenditure of an idealized integrate-and-fire (IIF) neuron whose excitatory synapses all have the same weight. Here, we extend their IIF model to a biophysically more realistic one in which synaptic weights are unequal. Using information theory, random Poisson measures, and the maximum entropy principle, we show that the probability density function (pdf) of interspike interval (ISI) duration induced by the bits per joule (bpj) maximizing pdf f(λ) of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) intensity remains equal to the delayed gamma distribution of the IIF model. We then show that, in the case of unequal weights, f(λ) satisfies an inhomogeneous Cauchy-Euler equation with variable coefficients for which we provide the general solution form.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Design Principles and Specifications for Neural-like Computation Under Constraints on Information Preservation and Energy Costs as Analyzed with Statistical Theory</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Given enough physical constraints, the format of optimal computation may resolve into a rather small set of options, which we call design specifications. Our interest centers on computational problems that are so intensive, relative to the time and energy available, that they can be solved only in a probabilistic fashion. Here we consider just information and energy in one particular computational format, called neural-like (n-l), and characterized as massively parallel, analog computation. Within this format, we consider only the design of a single n-l element and the nature of its inputs. Importantly, we provide a specific mathematical format of a simple n-l element. We consider this format to be minimal and generic and, therefore, extendable to structures composed of several n-l compartments. Secondly, the information and energy constraints are linked, via Shannon's entropy, to classical results from mathematical statistics yielding design specifications that go beyond our initial description of a n-l element and its inputs. Critically, for a n-l element to preserve all of its relevant input-information at minimal energetic cost, it must transform its inputs so as to create and communicate a minimal sufficient statistic. Then, the assumptions associated with producing such a statistic become new design specifications for n-l computing.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The peak constrained additive inverse Gaussian noise channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In molecular communication, messages are conveyed in patterns of particles, which propagate from transmitter to receiver using Brownian motion. If there is positive drift from transmitter to receiver, the first arrival time of the particles has the inverse Gaussian distribution, leading to the additive inverse Gaussian noise channel. In this paper, we give a closed-form upper bound on capacity for this channel when the maximum waiting time is constrained, building on previous work in which only the mean waiting time was constrained.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Systematic Error-Correcting Codes for Rank Modulation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The rank modulation scheme has been proposed recently for efficiently writing and storing data in nonvolatile memories. Error-correcting codes are very important for rank modulation, and they have attracted interest among researchers.&#13;
&#13;
In this work, we explore a new approach, systematic error-correcting codes for rank modulation. In an (n,k) systematic code, we use the permutation induced by the levels of n cells to store data, and the permutation induced by the first k cells has a one-to-one mapping to information bits. Systematic codes have the benefits of enabling efficient information retrieval and potentially supporting more efficient encoding and decoding procedures. We study systematic codes for rank modulation equipped with the Kendall's tau-distance. We present (k+2,k) systematic codes for correcting one error, which have optimal sizes unless perfect codes exist. We also study the design of multi-error-correcting codes, and prove that for any 2&lt;=k&lt;n, there always exists an (n,k) systematic code of minimum distance n-k. Furthermore, we prove that for rank modulation, systematic codes achieve the same capacity as general error-correcting codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Snake-in-the-Box Codes for Rank Modulation</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Motivated by the rank-modulation scheme with applications to flash memory, we consider Gray codes capable of detecting a single error, also known as snake-in-the-box codes. We study two error metrics: Kendall's $\tau$-metric, which applies to charge-constrained errors, and the $\ell_\infty$-metric, which is useful in the case of limited-magnitude errors. In both cases we construct snake-in-the-box codes with rate asymptotically tending to $1$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Rank Modulation for Translocation Error Correction</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider rank modulation codes for flash memories that allow for handling arbitrary charge drop errors. Unlike classical rank modulation codes used for correcting errors that manifest themselves as swaps of two adjacently ranked elements, the proposed translocation rank codes account for more general forms of errors that arise in storage systems. Translocations represent a natural extension of the notion of adjacent transpositions and as such may be analyzed using related concepts in combinatorics and rank modulation coding. Our results include tight bounds on the capacity of translocation rank codes, construction techniques for asymptotically good codes and one simple decoding method.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On ML-Certificate Linear Constraints for Rank Modulation with Linear Programming Decoding and its Application to Compact Graphs</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>As intersecting research among permutation codes, rank modulation, and linear programming, matrix polytopes with no fractional vertex are investigated. By focusing the discussion to block structures of matrices, new classes of such polytopes shall be obtained from known small polytopes. This concept, called &quot;consolidation&quot;, is applied to find a new compact graph which is known as an approach for graph isomorphism problem. Encoding and decoding algorithms for our new codes are obtained from small polytopes. By changing the basis of matrix, some minimum weights of the code may become larger than the original one.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Linear Programming Upper Bounds on Permutation Code Sizes From Coherent Configurations Related to the Kendall-Tau Distance Metric</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Recent interest on permutation rank modulation shows the Kendall-Tau metric as an important distance metric. This note documents our first efforts to obtain upper bounds on optimal code sizes (for said metric) ala Delserte's approach. For the Hamming metric, Delserte's seminal work on powerful linear programming (LP) bounds have been extended to permutation codes, via association scheme theory. For the Kendall-Tau metric, the same extension needs the more general theory of coherent configurations, whereby the optimal code size problem can be formulated as an extremely huge semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Inspired by recent algebraic techniques for solving SDP's, we consider the dual problem, and propose an LP to search over a subset of dual feasible solutions. We obtain modest improvement over a recent Singleton bound due to Barg and Mazumdar. We regard this work as a starting point, towards fully exploiting the power of Delserte's method, which are known to give some of the best bounds in the context of binary codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Lossy Communication over Multiple-Access Channels with Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of lossy communication of correlated sources over multiple access channels with noiseless causal feedback. A sufficient condition for lossy transmission is presented, which generalizes several previous results on communication over multiple access channels, recovering as special cases channel coding results by King, Cover, and Leung, and extending a previous sufficient condition for lossless communication by Cover, El Gamal, and Salehi. The proposed coding scheme is based on a recently developed analog-digital hybrid coding scheme for joint source--channel coding combined with block-Markov coding.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Compute-and-Forward Transform</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We derive an achievable rate region for the Gaussian K-user multiple-access channel (MAC) where all users transmit codewords from a chain of nested lattices. For any set of channel coefficients, this rate region contains points within a constant gap from the sum capacity boundary of the MAC. The main tool used is the recently proposed compute-and-forward framework. A new transformation of a MAC to a modulo-lattice multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel is introduced based on this framework. Specifically, from one noisy linear combination of the transmitted signals the receiver attempts to decode K linearly independent equations with integer-valued coefficients. While the individual rates at which these equations can be decoded are highly sensitive to the exact channel gains, their sum is always within a constant gap from the sum capacity boundary of the MAC. The transformation is then utilized for establishing the desired rate region.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On Modulo-Sum Computation over an Erasure Multiple Access Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We study computation of a modulo-sum of two binary source sequences over a two-user erasure multiple access channel. Each sender observes an independent and equiprobable binary sequence and the receiver is interested in computing the modulo-sum of these two sequences. The channel is modelled as a binary-input, erasure multiple access channel, which can be in one of three states — either the channel output is a modulo-sum of the two input symbols, or the channel output equals the input symbol on the first link and an erasure on the second link, or it equals the input symbol on the second link and an erasure on the first link. The associated state sequence is independent and identically distributed. We establish upper and lower bounds on the modulo-sum capacity. Our coding scheme uses either the compute and forward or the decode and forward techniques. The upper bound is obtained by revealing part of the state sequence to the encoders and exploiting the independence of the source sequences. It is in general is tighter than a simple upper bound obtained by revealing one of the messages to the decoders. We also briefly consider the case when a strictly causal state feedback is available to the encoders and establish that such feedback can increase the modulo-sum capacity.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Performance of MIMO Single-Carrier Frequency Domain Zero-Forcing Equalizer</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) has many advantages, but in the MIMO frequency selective channel its performance has not been fully characterized and several important open questions remain. This paper analyzes the diversity of zero-forcing MIMO SC-FDE. It is shown that the diversity of the ZF receiver over this channel is the same as that of the ZF receiver in the frequency-flat channel. To improve the performance, a lattice-reduction (LR) aided ZF equalization is proposed and analyzed. It is shown that the full spatial and temporal diversity is achieved by he LR-aided ZF receiver for the uncoded transmission. This is the first analytical proof for the LR-aided equalization for MIMO frequency selective channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Matrix Exponential Learning: Distributed Optimization in MIMO systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We analyze the problem of finding the optimal signal covariance matrix for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channels (MAC) by using an approach based on &quot;exponential learning&quot;, a novel optimization method which applies more generally to (quasi-)convex problems defined over sets of positive-definite matrices (with or without trace constraints). If the channels are static, the system users converge to a power allocation profile which attains the sum capacity of the channel exponentially fast (in practice, within a few iterations); otherwise, if the channels fluctuate stochastically over time (following e.g. a stationary ergodic process), users converge to a power profile which attains their ergodic sum capacity instead.&#13;

An important feature of the algorithm is that its speed can be controlled by tuning the users' learning rate; correspondingly, the algorithm converges within a few iterations even when the number of users and/or antennas per user in the system is large.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Asymptotic Data Rates of Receive-Diversity Systems with MMSE Estimation and Interferers at Correlated Locations</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>An asymptotic technique is presented to characterize the bits/symbol achievable on a representative wireless link in the presence of spatially distributed interferers with correlated positions, N receive diversity branches, and linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE) receivers. The models analyzed include analogs to Matern type I and type II networks. It is found that for our network models, with large N, the correlation between interferer positions does not significantly influence the bits/symbol resulting in simple approximations for the data rates achievable in such networks with large numbers of diversity branches.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Connecting DMT of Division Algebra Space-Time Codes and Point Counting in Lie Groups</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Earlier it was proven by Vehkalahti and Lu how the unit group and diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off (DMT) of division algebra-based space-time codes are linked to each other through inverse determinant sums. This work explores this relation further, showing that indeed the density of unit group completely determines the growth of the inverse determinant sum. In particular, in the case of $\Q(i)$-central division algebras, the lower bound obtained from the DMT and the upper bound derived from the growth rate of units coincide.</abstract>

        <papertitle>DMT-optimal, Low ML-Complexity STBC-Schemes for Asymmetric MIMO Systems</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>For an $n_t$ transmit, $n_r$ receive antenna ($n_t\times n_r$) MIMO system with quasi-static Rayleigh fading, it was shown by Elia et. al that schemes based on minimal-delay space-time block codes (STBCs) with a symbol rate of $n_t$ complex symbols per channel use (rate-$n_t$) and a {\it non-vanishing determinant} (NVD) are diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT)-optimal for arbitrary values of $n_r$. Further, explicit linear STBC-schemes (LSTBC-schemes) with the NVD property were also constructed. However, for asymmetric MIMO systems (where $n_r &lt; n_t$), with the exception of the Alamouti code-scheme for the $2 \times 1$ system and rate-1, diagonal STBC-schemes with NVD for an $n_t \times 1$ system, no known minimal-delay, rate-$n_r$ STBC-scheme has been shown to be DMT-optimal. In this paper, we first obtain an enhanced sufficient criterion for an STBC-scheme to be DMT optimal and using this result, we show that for certain asymmetric MIMO systems, many well-known LSTBC-schemes which have low ML-decoding complexity are DMT-optimal, a fact that was unknown hitherto.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we study the problem of coordinating two nodes which can only exchange information via a relay at limited rates. The nodes are allowed to do a two-round interactive two-way communication with the relay, after which they should be able to generate i.i.d.\ copies of two random variables with a given joint distribution within a vanishing total variation distance. We prove inner and outer bounds on the coordination capacity region for this problem. Our inner bound is proved using the technique of ``output statistics of random binning&quot; that has recently been developed by Yassaee, et al.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Channel Simulation via Interactive Communications</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we study the problem of channel simulation via interactive communication, known as the coordination capacity, in a two-terminal network. We assume that two terminals observe i.i.d.\ copies of two random variables and would like to generate i.i.d.\ copies of two other random variables jointly distributed with the observed random variables. The terminals are provided with two-way communication links, and shared common randomness, all at limited rates. Two special cases of this problem are the interactive function computation studied by Ma and Ishwar, and the tradeoff curve between one-way communication and shared randomness studied by Cuff. The latter work had inspired Gohari and Anantharam to study the general problem of channel simulation via interactive communication stated above. However only inner and outer bounds for the special case of no shared randomness were obtained in their work. In this paper we settle this problem by providing an exact computable characterization of the multi-round problem. To show this we employ the technique of ``output statistics of random binning&quot; that has been recently developed by the authors.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Action Dependent Strictly Causal State Communication</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. The problem of communication and state estimation is considered in the context of channels with action-dependent states. Given the message to be communicated, the transmitter chooses an action sequence that affects the formation of the channel states, and then creates the channel input sequence based on the state sequence. The decoder estimates the channel to some distortion as well as decodes the message. The capacity- distortion tradeoff of such a channel is characterized for the case when the state information is available strictly causally at the channel encoder. The problem setting extends the action dependent framework of [1] and as a special case recovers the results of few previously considered joint communication and estimation scenarios in [2], [3], [4]. The scenario when the action is also allowed to depend on the past observed states (adaptive action) is also considered. It is shown that such adaptive action yields an improved capacity-distortion function.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Multi-stage Coding for Channels With a Rewrite Option and Reversible Input</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>&quot;THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD&quot; We consider a problem of constrained multi-stage coding for channels with a rewrite option. It is a natural extension of Weissman's channel with action-dependent state to the multi-stage coding case where an encoder in each stage observes its own message as well as all previous-stage messages, inputs, and outputs. In addition to decoding all messages at the final stage, the new reconstruction constraint introduced in Sumszyk and Steinberg's information embedding with reversible stegotext is imposed on the problem such that the decoder is required to be able to reconstruct all channel input sequences reliably. The complete characterization of the channel capacity region is given for the two-stage case, while the inner and outer bounds to the capacity regions for the cases of three or more stages are provided. For the two-stage case, a discussion regarding the rate constraint of the message in the second stage is also given in which we can draw a connection to the two-stage coding condition which appears in our previous study on channel with action-dependent state and reversible input.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Amplification of the Hidden Gaussian Channel States</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We consider the problem of amplifying the channel states in a state-dependent Gaussian channel, where the encoder knows (non-causally) a noisy version of the channel states, i.e., the channel states are hidden under the noise. We provide a complete characterization of the minimum state reconstruction distortion at the decoder under a power constraint at the encoder, and show that a simple analog scheme with power control is optimal. More precisely, if the power available to the encoder is below certain threshold, the analog scheme using full power is optimal, however when the power available to the encoder is above that threshold, analog transmission using only a fixed amount of the available power is optimal. This is in contrast to the state amplification problem considered by Sutivong et al., when the channel states are known perfectly at the encoder for which the full power is always used in the optimal scheme. The converse proof of our result relies on a channel decomposition argument which was not necessary for the simpler case when the channel states are known perfectly.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Low-Density Arrays of Circulant Matrices: Rank and Row-Redundancy, and QC-LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>This paper is concerned with general analysis on the rank and row-redundancy of an array of circulants whose null space defines a QC-LDPC code. Based on the Fourier transform and the properties of conjugacy classes and Hadamard products of matrices, tight bounds on rank and row-redundancy are derived, which make it possible to consider row-redundancy in constructions of QC-LDPC codes to achieve better performance. Moreover, a new construction of QC-LDPC codes from random partitions of finite fields, which has flexible code dimensions and is abundant in row-redundancy, is presented and analyzed.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the Girth of Quasi Cyclic Protograph LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we study the relationships between the girth of the Tanner graph of a quasi cyclic (QC) protograph low-density parity-check (LDPC) code, on one hand, and the lifting degree and the size and the structure of the base graph, on the other hand. As a result, for a given base graph and a given lifting degree, we derive an upper bound on the girth of the resulting lifted graphs (codes). The upper bounds derived here are generally tighter than the existing bounds. The results presented in this work can be used to select an appropriate lifting degree for a given base graph, in order to have a desired girth, or to provide some insight in designing good base graphs, or to properly select the base graph's edge permutations.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A Greedy Search for Improved QC LDPC Codes with Good Girth Profile and Degree Distribution</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The girth profile is introduced and search algorithms for regular and irregular quasi-cyclic LDPC block codes with both good girth profile and good degree distribution are presented. New QC LDPC block codes of various code rates are obtained and their bit error rate performance is compared with that of the corresponding LDPC block codes defined in the IEEE 802.16 WiMAX standard of the same block length and code rate.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Trapping Set Structure of Finite Geometry LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The trapping set structure of LDPC codes constructed using finite geometries is analyzed. A trapping set is modeled as a sub-geometry of the geometry used to construct an LDPC code. The variable nodes of a trapping set are viewed as points of the geometry and the check nodes adjacent to the variable nodes are viewed as the lines passing through any of these points. Based on this geometrical representation of a trapping set, its configuration can be determined.</abstract>

        <papertitle>A New Parity Structure With Multi-Weight Circulants for QC LDPC Codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The block dual-diagonal (BDD) parity structure is widely adopted in many practical irregular quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. These QC LDPC codes have good error-correcting performance in waterfall region but usually show relatively high error floors in low error rate region. In this paper, by using multi-weight circulants, a new BDD structure is proposed for the parity part of irregular QC LDPC codes to lower error floors and support efficient encoding. Since the parity part of parity-check matrices has flexible degree distribution with the aid of multi-weight circulants, QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure can have large minimum Hamming distance compared to those with the conventional BDD structure, especially, in the low-rate case. Simulation results show that QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure have lower error floor than those with the conventional BDD structure.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper we first give the Lagrange interpolation polynomials in rings of matrices over finite fields and propose a new secret sharing scheme similar to Shamir secret sharing scheme as its direct application in cryptography. We also construct the generalized Reed-Solomon codes over a noncommutative ring of matrices over a finite field. We show that they are cyclic codes and present its minimal distance, its dual codes and Goppa formulation by the above interpolation polynomials.</abstract>

        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>In this paper, we consider the construction of lexicodes by using a B-ordering over the ring Z_4. First a greedy algorithm is presented to build lexicodes using a multiplicative property. Then, greedy algorithms are given for the case when the selection criteria is not multiplicative such as the minimum distance constraint. It is shown that this construction produces many optimal codes over Z_4 and also good binary codes.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Construction of Barnes-Wall Lattices from Linear Codes over Rings</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Dense lattice packings can be obtained via the well-known Construction A from \emph{binary} linear codes. In this paper, we use an extension of Construction A called Construction A$^\prime$ to obtain Barnes-Wall lattices from linear codes over polynomials rings. To obtain the Barnes-Wall lattice $BW_{2^{m}}$ in $\mathbb{C}^{2^{m}}$ for any $m \geq 1$, we first identify a linear code $\mathcal{C}_{2^m}$ over the quotient ring $\mathcal{U}_{m} = \mathbb{F}_{2}[u] \diagup u^{m}$ and then propose a mapping $\psi: \mathcal{U}_{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that the code $\mathcal{L}_{2^{m}} = \psi(\mathcal{C}_{2^{m}})$ is a lattice constellation. Further, we show that $\mathcal{L}_{2^{m}}$ has the cubic shaping property when $m$ is even. Finally, we show that $BW_{2^{m}}$ can be obtained through Construction A$^\prime$ as $BW_{2^{m}} = (1+i)^{m}\mathbb{Z}[i]^{2^{m}} \oplus \mathcal{L}_{2^{m}}$.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the algebraic representation of selected optimal non-linear binary codes</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Revisiting an approach by J. H. Conway and N. J. A. Sloane we investigate a collection of optimal non-linear binary codes and represent them as (non-linear) codes over Z4. The Fourier transform will be used in order to analyze these codes, which leads to a new algebraic representation involving subgroups of the group of units in a certain ring. One of our results is a new representation of Best's (10, 40, 4) code as a coset of a subgroup in the group of invertible elements of the group ring Z4[Z5]. This yields a particularly simple algebraic decoding algorithm for this code. The technique at hand is further applied to analyze Julin's (12, 144, 4) code and the (12, 24, 12) Hadamard code. It can also be used in order to construct a (non-optimal) binary (14, 56, 6) code.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Full-duplex Transmitter Cooperation, Feedback, and the Degrees of Freedom of SISO Gaussian Interference and X Channels</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The Gaussian single-input single-output (SISO) K-user interference and M-by-K X channels are investigated in i.i.d. fading environment with no instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at transmitters. First, it is assumed that the CSI is fed back to all nodes after some delay (delayed CSIT), and furthermore, the transmitters operate in full-duplex mode. Achievable results on the degrees of freedom (DoF) of these channels under the above assumption are obtained. Then, achievable DoFs are obtained for the K-user interference and K-by-K X channels with output feedback and also Shannon feedback, which is a combination of output feedback and delayed CSIT, and compared with the achievable DoFs under the full-duplex delayed CSIT assumption.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Generalized Degrees of Freedom of the Symmetric K-user Interference Channel with Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>The symmetric K user interference channel with fully connected topology is considered, in which (a) each receiver suffers interference from all other K-1 transmitters, and (b) each transmitter has causal and noiseless feedback from its respective receiver. The number of generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) is characterized in terms of α, where the interference- to-noise ratio (INR) is given by INR = SNRα. It is shown that the per-user GDoF of this network is the same as that of the 2-user interference channel with feedback, except for α = 1, for which existence of feedback does not help in terms of GDoF. The coding scheme proposed for this network, termed cooperative interference alignment, is based on two key ingredients, namely, interference alignment and interference decoding.</abstract>

        <papertitle>Feedback in the K-user Interference Channel</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. We consider the scalar $K$-user Gaussian interference channel (IC) with feedback, where channel coefficients are fixed over time and frequency and assume that trasceivers operate in full-duplex mode. We focus on two feedback models: (1) each receiver feeds back its received signal to all the transmitters and (2) functions of the received signals are fed back through a {\em backward} IC. We show that the feedback degrees-of-freedom (${\sf fdof}$) of the first model is $\frac{K}{2}$ if the global channel matrix is invertible. For the second feedback model, we show that ${\sf fdof}=\frac{3}{2}$ is achievable for the $3$-user IC. Then, we show how nontrivial ${\sf fdof}$ can be achieved for the $K$-user IC, when the global channel matrix belongs to a specific spectral family of matrices. Our achievability schemes require a {\it finite} number of signal-space dimensions, contrasting the asymptotic interference alignment schemes for the non-feedback case. Another consequence of feedback is that it can strictly increase the degrees-of-freedom for some classes of ICs.</abstract>

        <papertitle>The Generalized Multiplexing Gain Region of the Slow Fading MIMO Interference Channel and its Achievability with Limited Feedback</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>Assuming a {\it slow-fading} channel model, we characterize the number of feedback bits required per channel realizations to preserve the multiplexing-gain region (MGR) of a 2-user MIMO IC, with $M_i$ antennas at transmitter $i$, $N_i$ antennas at receiver $i$, arbitrary signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and interference-to-noise ratios (INRs) and perfect channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). As a first step, we prove that a simple HK coding scheme with public-private message split at each transmitter can achieve the full-CSIT (FCSIT) MGR of the channel if the covariance matrices for the input at each transmitter is a particular function of the null-space of the corresponding cross-link channel matrix. In this coding scheme, the multiplexing-gains of the sub-messages can be chosen without any CSIT. Therefore, CSI at transmitter $i$, is required to only construct the covariance matrices using the null-space information of the corresponding cross-link channel matrix and does not require the complete knowledge of the instantaneous channel realizations. Building on this result, we show that an approximate version of this null-space -- expressed in terms of $N_j(M_i-N_j)^+\log(\textrm{INR})$ number of bits per channel realization -- at transmitter $i$, is sufficient to achieve the FCSIT MGR of the channel.</abstract>

        <papertitle>On the ARQ Protocols over the Z-interference Channels: Diversity-Multiplexing-Delay Tradeoff</papertitle>
        <trackname>2012 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory</trackname>
        <abstract>We characterize the achievable three-dimensional tradeoff between diversity, multiplexing and delay of the single antenna Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) Z-interference channel. Non-cooperative and cooperative ARQ protocols are adopted under these assumptions. Considering no cooperation exists, we study the achievable tradeoff of the fixed-power split Han-Kobayashi (HK) approach. Interestingly, we demonstrate that if the second user transmits the common part only of its message in the event of its successful decoding and a decoding failure at the first user, communication is improved over that achieved by keeping or stopping the transmission of both the common and private messages. Under cooperation, two special cases of the HK are considered for static and dynamic decoders. The difference between the two decoders lies in the ability of the latter to dynamically choose which HK special-case decoding to apply. Cooperation is shown to dramatically increase the achievable first user diversity.</abstract>
