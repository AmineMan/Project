Abstract—We show that for those lattices of Voronoi’s ﬁrst
kind with known obtuse superbasis, a vector of shortest nonzero
Euclidean length can computed in polynomial time by computing
a minimum cut in a graph.

in Section V.

I. I NTRODUCTION

The (open) Voronoi cell, denoted Vor(Λ), of a lattice Λ
in Rn is the subset of Rn containing all points nearer, with
respect to a given norm, the lattice point at the origin than
any other lattice point. The Voronoi cell is an n-dimensional
convex polytope that is symmetric about the origin. Here
we will always assume the Euclidean norm (or 2-norm), so
Vor(Λ) contains those points nearest in Euclidean distance to
the origin.
Equivalently the Voronoi cell can be deﬁned as the intersection of the half spaces

II. VORONOI CELLS , RELEVANT VECTORS , AND SHORT
VECTORS

A n-dimensional lattice, Λ, is a discrete set of vectors from
Rm , m ≥ n, formed by the integer linear combinations of a set
of linearly independent basis vectors b1 , . . . , bn from Rm . That
is, Λ, consists of all those vectors, or lattice points, x ∈ Rm
satisfying
x = b1 u1 + b2 u2 + · · · + bn un

u1 , . . . un ∈ Z.

An interesting question about a lattice is: ‘What is the
shortest distance between any two lattice points?’ Because the
origin is a lattice point this question can be equivalently stated
as: ‘What is the length of the shortest lattice point not equal
to the origin?’ Those points in the lattice with shortest length
are called short vectors. The problem of discovering a lattice
point of shortest length is called the shortest vector problem
and has applications to, for example, cryptography [1]. In
general, i.e. for arbitrary lattices, the shortest vector problem
is NP-hard [2, 3]1 . However, for some lattices, the problem is
easy to solve. For example, short vectors are relatively easy to
determine in highly regular lattices, such as the root lattices
∗
An and Dn , their dual lattices A∗ and Dn , and the integer
n
n
lattice Z [4, Chap. 4].
In this paper we consider a particular class of lattices, those
of Voronoi’s ﬁrst kind [5–7]. Each lattice of Voronoi’s ﬁrst
kind has what is called an obtuse superbasis. We show that
if the obtuse superbasis is known, then a short vector can be
computed in polynomial time by computing a minimum cut
in a graph. If the lattice has dimension n, this requires O(n3 )
operations to deterministically compute a short vector [8], or
O(n2 (log n)3 ) operations to compute a short vector with high
probability [9].
The paper is structured as follows. Section II deﬁnes the
short vectors of a lattice along with some related entities,
the Voronoi cell and the relevant vectors. Section III deﬁnes
lattices of Voronoi’s ﬁrst kind and shows how their short
vectors can be found by solving a constrained quadratic
program in binary {0, 1} variables. Section IV describes how
this constrained program can be mapped into that of computing

Hv = {x ∈ Rn | x · v < 1 v · v}
2
for all v ∈ Λ\{0}, i.e. all lattice points v ∈ Λ not equal to
the origin 0. Here x · v is the inner product between vectors x
and v. It is not necessary to consider all v ∈ Λ\{0} to deﬁne
the Voronoi cell. The minimal set of lattice vectors R such
that Vor(Λ) = ∩v∈R Hv is called the set of Voronoi relevant
vectors or simply relevant vectors [7].
Deﬁnition 1. The relevant vectors v ∈ Λ are those for which
v·x<x·x
for all x ∈ Λ with x = v and x = 0.2
The short (or minimal) vectors in a lattice are all those
lattice points of minimum nonzero Euclidean length, i.e all
those of squared length
min

x 2.

x∈Λ\{0}

Plainly, every short vector is also a relevant vector, because,
if a lattice point s is not relevant there exists a lattice point
x not equal to s or 0 such that x · s ≥ x · x or equivalently
x
x
s
x · s ≥ x after dividing by x . Since both x and s
are unit vectors and s = x then,
s =

s
s

·s>

x
x

·s≥ x ,

i.e, s > x , so s is not a short vector.
2 These are the ‘strict’ relevant vectors according to Conway and Sloane [5].
If the inequality v · x < x · x is replaced by v · x ≤ x · x then this would
also include the ‘lax’ relevant vectors. The short vectors are always strict so
we only have use of the strict relevant vectors here.

1 Speciﬁcally, the shortest vector problem is known to be hard for NP under
what are called reverse unfaithful random reductions [2].

III. L ATTICES OF VORONOI ’ S FIRST KIND
An n-dimensional lattice Λ is said to be of Voronoi’s ﬁrst
kind if it has what is called an obtuse superbasis [5]. That
is, there exists a set of n + 1 vectors b1 , . . . , bn+1 such that
b1 , . . . , bn are a basis for Λ,
b1 + b2 · · · + bn+1 = 0

W (C, C) =

where I = {i | vi ∈ C} and J = {j | vj ∈ C}. That is,
¯ is the sum of the weights on the edges crossing from
W (C, C)
¯
the vertices in C to the vertices in C. If the graph is allowed
to contain loops, i.e. edges from a vertex to itself, then the
weight of these edges wii have no effect on the weight of any
cut. We may choose any values for the wii without affecting
¯
W (C, C).

The minimum cut is the C and C that minimise the weight

(the obtuse condition). The qij are called the Selling parameters. It is known that all lattices in dimensions less than 4 are
of Voronoi’s ﬁrst kind [5]. An interesting property of lattices
of Voronoi’s ﬁrst kind is that their relevant vectors have a
straightforward description.
Theorem 1. (Conway and Sloane [5, Theorem 3]) The relevant vectors of Λ are of the form,

i.e. I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n + 1} and I = ∅.

O(|V | (log |V |)3 ) = O(n2 (log(n))3 )

Because each short vector is also a relevant vector we have
the following corollary.

say. Finding a minimum cut is equivalent to ﬁnding the binary
{0, 1} vector u that minimises F (u) under the constraint that
at least one element in u is equal to 1 and at least one
element in u is equal to 0. This constraint corresponds to the
¯
requirement that both C and C are nonempty.
Expanding,

A short vector is a minimiser of this form under the constraint
that the ui ∈ {0, 1} and at least one element of u is equal
to 1 and at least one element of u is equal to 0. The next
section will show how this constrained quadratic minimisation
problem can be solved by computing a minimum cut in a
graph. This technique has appeared previously [10–12] but we
include the derivation here so that this paper is self contained.

weights are symmetric, i.e. wij = wji . A cut in the graph G is

superbasis condition (1).
Because the qij are nonpositive for i = j the weights wij are
nonnegative for all i = j with i, j ∈ {1, n + 1}. As discussed
the value of the weights wii have no effect on the weight of
any cut so setting qii = −wii for i ∈ {1, n + 1} is of no
consequence. A vector u that minimises Q(u) can be found
by computing a minimum cut in the graph with these weights.

The corresponding graph is the complete graph with n + 1

As each weight is equal and the graph is complete, a minimum
cut is given by placing precisely one vertex into C and the

remaining vertices into C. The weight of this cut is n+1 .
All the superbasis vectors b1 , . . . , bn+1 are short vectors of

In both of the previous examples short vectors could be
obtained by picking one of the vectors b1 , . . . , bn+1 in the
obtuse superbasis. This is not always the case, as our ﬁnal
example will show. Consider the 3-dimensional lattice with
obtuse superbasis

As examples we apply this minimum cut approach to ﬁnding
a short vector in the root lattice An and its dual lattice A∗ [4,

pp. 108-117]. An obtuse superbasis for An is all the cyclic

VI. C ONCLUSION
We have described a method for computing a short vector
in a lattice of Voronoi’s ﬁrst kind when its obtuse superbasis
is known. This is achieved by mapping the shortest vector
problem into that of computing a minimum cut in a weighted
graph. Existing polynomial time algorithms can then be applied [8, 9].
