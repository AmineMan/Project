Performance of MIMO Single-Carrier Frequency
Domain Zero-Forcing Equalizer
Ahmed Hesham Mehana and Aria Nosratinia
Dept. Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA
Hedayat and Nosratinia [9] consider the outage probability as
a function of ﬁxed rates R under joint and separate spatial
encoding for ZF and MMSE receivers. Kumar et al. [10]
provide a DMT analysis for the system of [9]. Hesham et
al. characterize the diversity of MMSE receiver as function of
rate (b/s/Hz) and the number of antennas in both frequency
ﬂat and frequency selective channel [11], [3].

Abstract— Single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SCFDE) has many advantages, but in the MIMO frequency selective
channel its performance has not been fully characterized and
several important open questions remain. This paper analyzes
the diversity of zero-forcing MIMO SC-FDE. It is shown that
the diversity of the ZF receiver over this channel is the same as
that of the ZF receiver in the frequency-ﬂat channel. To improve
the performance, a lattice-reduction (LR) aided ZF equalization
is proposed and analyzed. It is shown that the full spatial and
temporal diversity is achieved by he LR-aided ZF receiver for
the uncoded transmission. This is the ﬁrst analytical proof for the
LR-aided equalization for MIMO frequency selective channel.

To reduce the gap between the performances of linear
receivers and the maximum likelihood receiver, the lattice
reduction technique has been recently proposed. Lattice reduction [12], [13] aims to ﬁnd a better representation of the
channel matrix that has nearly orthogonal columns vectors,
thus the noise enhancement problem inherent in channel
inversion is reduced. It has been shown through simulations
(and analytical results for some cases) that the diversity order
of LR-aided receiver is the same as maximum likelihood.
In this paper we adopt the complex Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz
(CLLL) algorithms [14] and analytically obtain the diversity
order of LR-aided ZF over frequency selective MIMO channel
under cyclic-preﬁx transmission.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Single carrier frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE) is
a linear receiver with distinct advantages [1] that also has
been adopted in the 3GPP LTE standard. Recently [2], [3]
it was discovered that this receiver exhibits a surprising ratedependent diversity under MMSE SISO and SIMO scenarios.
Its behavior under zero-forcing MIMO conditions has been
hitherto unknown. This paper seeks to characterize the diversity of zero-forcing (ZF) SC-FDE MIMO equalization. We
are interested to know not only the value of diversity, but also
whether the diversity of the ZF receiver a function of the rate
and channel memory? We also investigate whether the LRaided ZF or MMSE equalizers achieve full diversity for all
rates.

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
Consider a quasi-static MIMO channel where the channel
impulse response remains unchanged during a transmission
block. We assume a multipath intersymbol interference channel (ISI) channel model. The channel impulse response between the transmit antenna m and receive antenna n is denoted
by the vector hmn = [hmn,0 , hmn,1 , . . . , hmn,ν ], where ν is
the channel memory. Assuming M transmit and N receive
antennas with N M , the received vector yk at time instant
k is given by [15], [2]

The results of this paper show that the ZF SC-FDE diversity
is largely suboptimal even with outer coding. In fact, the
diversity of the ZF SC-FDE in the frequency selective channel
is the same as in a frequency ﬂat channel. Motivated to
improve the system performance, we investigate a lattice
reduction (LR) aided equalization which has been recently
proposed for the frequency ﬂat MIMO channel. This paper
contributes the ﬁrst analysis of LR-aided linear receiver in
the context of frequency selective MIMO channels, which is
a signiﬁcant departure from the frequency-ﬂat analysis [4].

where Hi is the M × N channel matrix that has hmn,i as
its (m, n) element, xk−i is M × 1 transmitted vector at time
index k − i, yk is the N × 1 received vector and nk is the the
N × 1 Gaussian noise vector at time index k.
Consider a transmission of Ld + Le spatial vectors each of
size M × 1, where Ld and Le are the number of data vector
blocks and the number of data-extension blocks, respectively.
The ﬁrst Le vectors are discarded at the receiver [15]. The
model can be written as

We ﬁrst provide a short literature survey. The distribution
of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of
the linear MIMO receiver is generally unknown except in
asymptote of large number of antennas, and high/low SNR [5],
[6]. Since the system analysis depends on this distribution, the
exact performance remains unknown in many cases. Outage
and diversity analysis have also been a subject of interest. Gore
et al. [7] studies the performance of MMSE D-BLAST as well
as the ordered successive cancellation V-BLAST. Onggosanusi
et al. [8] study MMSE and zero-forcing (ZF) MIMO receivers.

Diversity analysis usually requires the analysis of the error
probability. We shall perform outage analysis as the ﬁrst
step towards deriving the diversity function. Lower and upper
bounds on error probability via outage probabilities follow
similarly to [11], [2]. This two-step approach was ﬁrst proposed in [18] due to the intractability of the direct error
analysis for many MIMO architectures.

Remark 1: It is clear that the ZF receiver is largely suboptimal compared to the MMSE receiver whose diversity is a
function of the spectral efﬁciency R (b/s/Hz) and was shown
to achieve full diversity at low rates [3].

The noise enhancement problem in the ZF equalization can
be reduced if the channel He is close to orthogonal. One
way to approximately orthogonalize the channel matrix before
equalization is Lattice reduction (LR) [12], [13].
Among different lattice reduction methods, the LLL reduction (or its complex version CLLL) algorithm (see, e.g. [22]
and the references therein) is widely used. The LLL algorithm
has a running time that is polynomial in the dimension of
the lattice and is therefore considered a candidate for the
practical applications. The orthogonality of a matrix Hr can
be quantiﬁed using the orthogonality defect deﬁned in [23]

that the LR-aided ZF diversity is dLR = M N (ν + 1).

V. S IMULATION R ESULTS
We provide Monte Carlo simulations for i.i.d Rayleigh
fading channel. Figure 1 shows the outage probability of
the SIMO frequency-selective channel with the following
parameters: M = 1, N = 2, ν = 1 and R = 2 b/s/Hz. The
diversity of the SC ZF-FDE is N − M + 1 = 2 whereas the
LR-aided ZF equalizer achieves the full diversity. Figure 2
shows the case of MIMO channel with M = N = 2, ν = 1
and R = 2 b/s/Hz. while the LR-aided ZF receiver achieves
the maximum diversity, the diversity of the SC ZF-FDE is 1.

where κ(D) is the condition number of D. It is obvious that
the worst-case complexity of LLL is unbounded. However, It
is shown in [24] that if the decoder is allowed to time-out and
declare an error when the number of ﬂoating point operations
exceeds a given threshold, then the system achieves the
same diversity of the unbounded LR decoder with reasonable
complexity.
B. Pairwise Error Probability Analysis

VI. C ONCLUSION

The lower bound on PEP is based on Fano’s inequality as
in [18] with a careful treatment for the system model given in
Section II similar to [2]. Thus We have Perr ˙ Pout .
The upper bound on PEP for the ZF receiver is developed
using the union bound on error. Let O and E denote outage
and error events respectively. The PEP is given by
¯
Perr = P (E|O) Pout + P (E, O)

¯
Pout + P (E, O).

We analyze the single-carrier frequency domain zeroforcing (ZF) equalizer operating in frequency selective N ×M
MIMO channel (where M and N
M are the number of
transmit and receive antennas respectively). We show that the
diversity is the same as the diversity of the frequency-ﬂat
channel, which is N − M + 1. To improve the performance,
we propose a lattice reduction (LR) aided ZF equalizer. We
show that the LR-aided ZF achieves the full channel diversity
N M (ν + 1) where ν is the channel memory.

We use an approach similar to [2]. The authors in [2] have
shown that Perr ˙ Pout for the SISO SC-FDE equalizer by

A. Proof of Lemma 2
To prove Lemma 2, we need the following result.
Lemma 3: (The Specht Bound) [20] Let xi ∈ [L1 , L2 ] with

We now proceed to the proof of Lemma 2. We start with

We now condition on the event βa = (qMβ )q
