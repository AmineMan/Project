Abstract—A fundamental task in wireless communication is channel
estimation: Compute the channel parameters a signal undergoes while
traveling from a transmitter to a receiver. In the case of delay-Doppler
channel, a widely used method is the matched ﬁlter algorithm. It uses a
pseudo-random waveform of length N, and, in case of non-trivial relative
velocity between transmitter and receiver, its computational complexity
is O(N 2 log(N )). In this paper we introduce a novel approach of
designing waveforms that allow faster channel estimation. Using group
representation techniques we construct waveforms, which enable us to
introduce a new algorithm, called the ﬂag method, that signiﬁcantly
improves the matched ﬁlter algorithm. The ﬂag method ﬁnds the channel
parameters in O(m · N log(N )) operations, for channel of sparsity of
order m. We discuss applications of the ﬂag method to GPS, and radar
system as well.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A basic step in many wireless communication protocols [12]
is channel estimation: learning the channel parameters a signal
undergoes while traveling from a transmitter to a receiver. In this
paper we develop an efﬁcient algorithm for delay-Doppler (also called
time-frequency) channel estimation. Our algorithm provides a striking
improvement over current methods in the presence of high relative
velocity between a transmitter and a receiver. The latter scenario
occurs in GPS, radar systems, and mobile communication of fast
moving users, or very high frequency (GHz) communication. We start
by describing the channel estimation problem that we are going to
solve.

k=1 |αk | ≤ 1, ω k ∈ ZN depends on the relative velocity along
path k of the base station with respect to the transmitter, τ k ∈ ZN
encodes the delay along path k, and W ∈ H denotes a random white
noise of mean zero. The parameter m will be called the sparsity of
the channel.
The objective is:

A. Channel Estimation Problem
Denote by H = C(ZN ) the vector space of complex valued
functions on the set of integers ZN = {0, 1, ..., N − 1} equipped
with addition and multiplication modulo N. We assume that N is an
odd prime number. The vector space H is endowed with the inner
P
product f1 , f2 =
f1 [n]f2 [n], for f1 , f2 ∈ H, and referred to

as the Hilbert space of digital signals.
We consider the following mathematical model of time-frequency
channel estimation [12]. There exists a collection of users, each one
holds a waveform from H known to a base station (receiver). The
users transmit their waveforms to the base station. Due to multipath
effects, the waveforms undergo [11], [12] several time-frequency
shifts as a result of reﬂections from various obstacles. We make the
standard assumption of almost-orthogonality between waveforms of
different users. Hence, if a user transmits S ∈ H, then the base station

where W ∈ H denotes a random white noise of mean zero, and
(τ 0 , ω 0 ) ∈ ZN × ZN . The pair (τ 0 , ω 0 ) is called the time-frequency
shift, and the vector space V = ZN ×ZN is called the time-frequency
plane. We would like to solve the following:

is a convolution that can be computed, using the fast Fourier transform
(FFT), in O(N log(N )) operations.
As a consequence of Remark I.3, one can solve TFS problem in
O(N 2 log(N )) operations. To the best of our knowledge, the “lineby-line” computation is also the fastest known method [10]. If N is
large this may not sufﬁce. For example [1] in applications to GPS
N ≥ 1000. This leads to the following:

Problem I.2 (Time-frequency (TFS)): Design S ∈ H, and an
effective method of extracting the time-frequency shift (τ 0 , ω 0 ) from
S and R satisfying (I.2).

Problem I.4 (Fast matched ﬁlter (FMF)): Solve TFS problem in
almost linear complexity.

C. The Matched Filter (MF) Algorithm
A classical solution [4], [5], [6], [8], [12], [13], [14] to Problem
I.2, is the matched ﬁlter algorithm. We deﬁne the following matched
ﬁlter (MF) matrix of S and R:
D
E
2πi
M(R, S)[τ , ω] = R[n], e N ω·n · S[n + τ ] , (τ , ω) ∈ V.

Note that computing one entry in M(R, S) already takes O(N )
operations.

We introduce the ﬂag method to propose a solution to FMF problem. The idea is, ﬁrst, to ﬁnd a line on which the time-frequency shift
is located, and, then, to search on the line to ﬁnd the time-frequency
shift. We associate with the N +1 lines Lj , j = 1, ..., N +1, through
the origin in V, a system of “almost orthogonal” waveforms SLj ∈ H,
that we call ﬂags. They satisfy the following “ﬂag property”: For a
receiver waveform R given by (I.2) with S = SLj , we have

ζ 0 · M(S, S)[τ − τ 0 , ω − ω 0 ]

where N SR ≈ SN R is essentially (up to logarithmic factor) the
inverse of the signal-to-noise ratio between the waveforms S and W.
For simplicity, we assume that the N SR is of size O(1).
In order to extract the time-frequency shift (τ 0 , ω 0 ), it is “standard”2 (see [4], [5], [6], [8], [12], [13], [14]) to use pseudo-random
signal S ∈ H of norm one. In this case M(S, S)[τ −τ 0 , ω −ω 0 ] = 1
for (τ , ω) = (τ 0 , ω 0 ), and of order O( √1 ) if (τ , ω) = (τ 0 , ω 0 ).

Finally, for SL and R satisfying (I.4), we have the following search
method to solve FMF problem:

Identity (I.3) suggests the following “entry-by-entry” solution to
TFS problem: Compute the matrix M(R, S), and choose (τ 0 , ω 0 )
for which |M(R, S)[τ 0 , ω 0 ]| ≈ 1. However, this solution of TFS
problem is signiﬁcantly expensive in terms of arithmetic complexity,
i.e., the number of multiplication and addition operations is O(N 3 ).
One can do better using a ”line-by-line” computation. This is due to
the next observation.

II. T HE H EISENBERG –W EIL F LAG S YSTEM
The ﬂag waveforms, that play the main role in the ﬂag method,
are of a special type. Each of them is a sum of a pseudorandom
signal and a structural signal. The ﬁrst has the MF matrix which is
almost delta function at the origin, and the MF matrix of the second
is supported on a line. The design of these waveforms is done using
group representation theory. The pseudorandom signals are designed
[5], [6], [14] using the Weil representation, and will be called Weil
(peak) signals3 . The structural signals are designed [7], [8] using
the Heisenberg representation, and will be called Heisenberg (lines)
signals. We call the collection of all ﬂag waveforms, the Heisenberg–
Weil ﬂag system. In this section we brieﬂy recall constructions, and
properties of these waveforms. A more comprehensive treatment,
including proofs, will appear in [3].

E. The Cross Method
Another solution to TFS problem, is the cross method. The idea is
+1
similar to the ﬂag method. We associate with the N2 distinct pairs
of lines L, M ⊂ V a system of almost-orthogonal waveforms SL ,M ,
that we call crosses. The system satisﬁes

|M(R, SL ,M )[τ , ω]| =
: 1+εN , if (τ ,ω)∈(L ∪M ) (τ 0 ,ω0 );
εN , if (τ ,ω)∈V (L ∪M ) ,

for every f ∈ H, n ∈ ZN .
The operators (II.1) do not commute in general, but rather
obey the Heisenberg commutation relations π(τ , ω) ◦ π(τ , ω ) =
2πi
e N (τ ω −ωτ ) · π(τ , ω ) ◦ π(τ , ω), where ◦ denotes composition
of operators. The expression τ ω − ωτ vanishes if (τ , ω), (τ , ω )
are on the same line through the origin. Hence, for a given line
L ⊂ V = ZN × ZN we have a commutative collection of unitary
operators
π( ) : H → H, ∈ L.
(II.2)

where εN = O( √1 ), R is the receiver waveform (I.2), with S =
N
SL ,M , and L = L + (τ 0 , ω 0 ), M = M + (τ 0 , ω 0 ).
The complexity of the cross method is O(N log(N )). First, we
ﬁnd a line on which the time-frequency shift is located, and then
searching for the spike on the line. However, applications of the cross
method for channel estimation problem (I.1) is more involved, due to
fake intersections, and will not be discussed in this paper.

We use the theorem from linear algebra about simultaneous diagonalization of commuting unitary operators, and obtain [7], [8] a natural
orthonormal basis BL ⊂ H consisting of common eigenfunctions for
all the operators (II.2). The system of all such bases BL , where L runs
over all lines through the origin in V, will be called the Heisenberg
(lines) system. We use the following result [7], [8]:

F. Solution to the Channel Estimation Problem

Theorem II.1: The Heisenberg system satisﬁes the properties

Looking back to Problem I.1, we see that the ﬂag method provides
a fast solution, in O(m·N log(N )) operations, for channel estimation
of channel with sparsity m. Indeed, identity (I.4), and almost orthogonality property, imply that αk ≈ M(R, SL )[τ k , ω k ]/2, k = 1, ..., m,
where R is the waveform (I.1), with S = SL (see Fig. 5).

use the following result [5], [6]:

estimation problem in O(m · N log(N )) for channel of sparsity m.

A. Application to Radar
The model of digital radar works as follows [8]. A radar transmits a
waveform S ∈ H which bounces back from m targets. The waveform
R ∈ H which is received as an echo has the form

This is essentially a channel estimation problem, so the ﬂag
method solves it in O(m · N log(N )) operations.
B. Application to Global Positioning System (GPS)
The model of GPS works as follows [9]. A client on the earth
surface wants to know his/her geographical location. Satellites send
to earth their location. For simplicity, the location of a satellite is a
bit b ∈ {±1}. The satellite transmits to the earth its signal S ∈ H
multiplied by its location b. The client receives the signal

W is a random white noise.
Problem IV.2 (GPS problem): Find b given that S and R are
known.
6 It is analogous to data modulation using a delay-Doppler rake receiver in
spread-spectrum systems [12].

5 Using the τ ’s we can compute [9] the distance from the satellite to the
k
client, assuming that there is a line of sight between them.
