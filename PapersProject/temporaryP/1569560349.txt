on the capacity of this channel was obtained by Cover
and El Gamal [3]. Carleial introduced a more general
version of the simple relay channel usually called the
multi-access channel with generalized feedback (MACGF) [4]. In this model, node 1 and node 2 cooperate in
transmitting independent messages to node 3. However
the communication constraints between node 1 and node
2 were not taken into consideration which made this
model less attractive due to practical consideration. A
more general encoding/decoding strategy for the MACGF channel was developed by Willems, et al [5]. They
introduced backward decoding and used superposition
block Markov decoding to derive an achievable rate region for the MAC-GF channel model. In [6], Sendonaris,
et al. looked at the channel model from a different
perspective as a method of providing diversity to the system and they considered the communication constraints
between node 1 and node 2. Assuming the channels
are Gaussian, they derived an achievable region for this
model using the methods developed in [5]. We will refer
to this model as the generalized Gaussian relay (GGR)
channel model.
Recently, Ciofﬁ, Tse and their co-workers have reinvestigated the achievable rate region of the Gaussian
interference channel with selﬁsh users [7], [8]. Here,
only transmission powers were regarded as the strategies
of the players. A more information-theoretic formulation
of the game on the interference channel was given in
[9] where they also deﬁned the Nash equilibrium region
in the achievable rate region. They gave a complete
characterization of such a region for the deterministic
interference channel model and and approximate characterization (within 1 bit) for the cases of two-user
Gaussian interference channel model.
In this paper, we investigate the achievable rate region of the generalized Gaussian relay (GGR) channel
with selﬁsh users when the Willems, et al. cooperative
communication scheme is used by users (as speciﬁed in
[6]). Users’ strategies include transmission powers and

Abstract—Various cooperative communication schemes
have been proposed as a means to increase the capacity
of wireless networks. All such schemes assume that users
in the network will cooperate perfectly. However, in a
decentralized network this assumption is far from true.
Users are selﬁsh and care only about their own rates. They
can strategically deviate from their agreed role in such
cooperative communication schemes leading to a possible
degradation for all. In this paper, we study the incentives
for cooperative relaying in a simple model, namely the generalized Gaussian relay channel model (or MAC-GF). We
characterize all the Nash equilibrium rates and compare it
with the Pareto-optimal rates of the generalized Gaussian
relay channel model. granted.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The scarcity of spectrum is an impediment to the
growth of more capable wireless networks. Several
measures are sought to address this problem: Freeing
up unused spectrum, sharing of spectrum through new
paradigms such as cognitive radio sensing, as well as
sophisticated communication schemes that rely on user
cooperation. Such schemes involve not only cooperative
sharing of spectrum but also relaying. However, given
that cooperation can lead to rate degradation, this may
fail to happen with selﬁsh users. This leads us to ask:
Why would users cooperate in relaying?. What happens
if they don’t?[1]. We investigate these questions for a
prototypical communication channel model that depends
on such cooperation for relaying.
The (standard) relay channel model was introduced by
van der Meulen [2]. This involved communication from
a transmitter (node 1) to a receiver (node 3) with the aid
of a passive relay (node 2), i.e., the relay node does not
have any information of its own to send. An upper bound

We characterize all the Nash equilibrium rates and compare it with the Pareto-optimal rates of the generalized
Gaussian relay channel model. In particular we show
that there exists Nash equilibrium points which are not
on the Pareto-optimal boundary of the achievable region
of the GGR channel.

A. Channel Model and Achievable Region
The generalized Gaussian relay channel model is
shown in Figure 1. There are two users, both want to
transmit data to a common destination. There are two
differences from the standard relay channel model [3].
User i has its own information to send, denoted by
Wi . Both users can cooperate by relaying each others’
data in some fashion. This would increase both their
transmission rates. (In the standard relay channel, user
2 may help user 1 to increase its data rate but not the
other way round). When users are not cooperating in
their transmission, this model reduces to the standard
two-user MAC channel for which the capacity region is
well known.
Willems, et al . gave the best-known encoding strategies that the transmitting users can use, and a decoding
strategy to be used by the receiver. Sendonaris, et al
employed this communication scheme in his cooperative
communication model. We refer the reader to [6] and
the references therein for more details. In this paper,
we assume that either the two transmitting users do not
cooperate at all, and if they do, the two transmitters and
the receiver use the Willems, et al. encoding/decoding
scheme. However, since users are assumed selﬁsh, even
while “cooperating” they can deviate from the “optimal”
Sendonaris scheme by using a different power, transmission rates, or can refuse to cooperate entirely.
The discrete time mathematical model of the channel
(shown in Figure 1) is given by

parts: W10 to be sent directly to the destination, and
W12 to be sent to the destination via user 2. In addition
to these, it also sends an additional “cooperative” information to the destination for enhanced decoding. In any
block, user 1’s transmitted signal X1 is structured as
X10 =
X12 =

X1 = X10 + X12 + U1 where,
˜ 10 (W10 (i), W12 (i − 1), W21 (i − 1))

U1 = PU 1 U (W12 (i − 1), W21 (i − 1))

and the total power P1 is divided into (P10 , P12 , PU 1 )
such that P1 = P10 + P12 + PU 1 . The user selects
˜
˜
˜
X10 , X12 , U from i.i.d. samples from the N (0, 1) distribution.
Here, U1 denotes that part of the signal that carries the
“cooperative” information. Power used for transmitting
X10 directly to the destination is denoted by P10 , which
encodes W10 at rate R10 . Power used for transmitting
X12 to user 2 is denoted P12 , which encodes W12 to
user 2 at the rate R12 , and power used to transmit U1
to the destination is denoted PU 1 , which encodes the
“cooperative” information. User 2 constructs its transmit
signal X2 similarly.

Now, user 2 can construct its signal X2 only if it can
perfectly decode W12 . Thus, tranmission rate R12 (and
power P12 ) should be selected by user 1 so that W12
can be decoded perfectly by user 2. Similarly, rate R21
(and power P21 ) should be selected by user 2 so that
W21 can be decoded perfectly by user 1.

The Y0 , Y1 , Y2 are the received signals at the destination 0, user 1 and user 2 respectively. Xi is the signal
transmitted by user i, and Zi is additive channel noise
which is i.i.d. with distribution N (0, 1). We assume
that the transmission is done for B blocks of length n
each, and both B and n are large. Both users employ a
“cooperative” strategy based on the superposition block
Markov encoding and backward decoding [5]. More
speciﬁcally, user 1 divides information W1 into two

It was shown in [6] that an achievable rate region with
this scheme for the generalized Gaussian relay channel
is given as the convex hull of all rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) such

B. The role of the receiver

PU 1 PU 2 .

As already mentioned, the receiver can do decoding
in various orders. To determine if a particular rate pair
(R1 , R2 ) is a NE, we need to know the actual decoding
scheme/order being used by the receiver (among those
that can be used to achieve that rate pair). The role of
the receiver in the game is to a priori choose a decoding
order, possibly after it knows the channel conditions
(K10 , K20 , K12 , K21 ). There are six possible decoding
orders.
(i) Decoding order D1 : Receiver decodes (W12 , W21 )
ﬁrst, W10 next, and W20 last.
(ii) Decoding order D2 : Receiver decodes (W12 , W21 )
ﬁrst, W20 next, and W10 last.
(iii) Decoding order D3 : Receiver decodes W10 ﬁrst,
(W12 , W21 ) next, and W20 last.
(iv) Decoding order D4 : Receiver decodes W20 ﬁrst,
(W12 , W21 ) next, and W10 last.
(v) Decoding order D5 : Receiver decodes W20 ﬁrst, W10
next, and (W12 , W21 ) last.
(vi) Decoding order D6 : Receiver decodes W10 ﬁrst,
W20 next, and (W12 , W21 ) last.
The achievable rate region corresponding to decoding
order Di will be denoted by C(Di ). Also denote the
Pareto-optimal boundary points of C(Di ) as B(C(Di )).
The achievable region C of the GGR channel is the
convex hull of C(Di ), i = 1, . . . , 6. Thus any point in C
is obtained by time sharing among the various decoding
orders C(Di ), i = 1, . . . , 6. This time sharing procedure
is explained below.
We assume that (without the loss of generality) the
length of the transmission (i.e., the length of the game)
is T = 1 unit. Before the beginning of the game, the
receiver announces a time sharing parameter vector α :=
6
(α1 , . . . , α6 ) such that i=1 αi = 1. A given α implies
that the receiver will perform decoding according to the
i−1
i
decoding order Di during the time ( j=1 αj , j=1 αj ]
for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 where α0 = 0. Let (R1,Di , R2,Di ) be the
i−1
i
rate pair during time ( j=1 αj , j=1 αj ] with decoding
order Di . Then, the net rate (R1 , R2 ) during the time T
6
is calculated as (R1 , R2 ) = i=1 αi (R1,Di , R2,Di ).

where C(x) := 1 log(1 + x), for some power allocation
2
satisfying P10 +P12 +PU 1 = P1 and P20 +P21 +PU 2 =
P2 .
The proof can be found in [6] and the references
therein. The essential ideas are backward decoding and
coherent combining of the cooperative signals U1 and
U2 . By virtue of the backward decoding, the destination
will decode W12 (i) and W21 (i) from block i + 1. Thus,
decoding the ith block involves decoding the messages
W10 (i), W20 (i), W12 (i−1) and W21 (i−1). The receiver
decodes W12 and W21 jointly which are encoded in
the “cooperative” parts of the transmitted signals, U1
and U2 . So, effectively the receiver has to decode three
different streams of data, the joint stream (W12 , W21 ),
W10 and W20 from the aggregate signal. This is done
in the same way as successive interference cancellation
(SIC) decoding in a 3-user MAC channel. As in the
MAC channel, the receiver can decode these streams
in any order. For example, the receiver can do joint
decoding of (W12 , W21 ) ﬁrst, W10 second and W20 last.
The achievable rate region is computed by considering
all such possible decoding orders.
Both users are rational and selﬁsh, with their utility
functions equal to the total rates R1 and R2 that they
achieve. Hence, they will optimize their power allocation
to maximize their individual rate.
A strategy of user i is his encoding rates (Ri0 , Rij )
and power allocation (Pi0 , Pij , PU i ) such that Pi0 +
Pij + PU i ≤ Pi , j = i. Denote the strategy vector
si = (Ri0 , Rij , Pi0 , Pij , PU i ). Each user receives a
payoff equal to his achieved rate. Thus, Ui (s1 , s2 ) =
Ri = Ri0 + Rij if the power allocation for the two
users satisﬁes their power budgets and their encoding
rates satisfy the inequalities (3), else it is 0. Now, we
deﬁne Nash equilibrium region for the generalized relay
channel.

is a boundary point.
We also note that since (R1 , R2 ) is a boundary point

R10 = C 1+K 2 P20 and R20 = C K20 P20 .
20
Note that the receiver decodes (W12 , W21 ) ﬁrst, W10
next, and W20 last. First consider the possible deviations
by user 2. He can increase his rate R20 by increasing
P20 (by taking power from (P21 , PU 2 )). However, any
increase in P20 will increase the interference for the
decoding of W10 and the decoding will fail. Then SIC
will fail and the decoding of R20 itself will fail. Thus
user 2 will not attempt this deviation. The other deviation
possible for him is to increase R21 by increasing the
power in (P21 , PU 2 ) (by taking power from P20 ). This
can potentially increase R21 while the user 1’s rate
remains the same. But, this contradicts the fact that
(R1 , R2 ) is a boundary point. So, when (R1 , R2 ) is a
boundary point, user 2 has no incentive to deviate.
In the same way we can argue that user 1 also doesn’t
have any incentive to deviate.
We can prove the same result for all other decoding
orders D2 , . . . , D6 by similar arguments. These proofs
are thus omitted.

III. E QUILIBRIUM A NALYSIS
We will proceed by proving a series of results. The
main question is what rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) correspond to
a NE. The following proposition gives a restriction on
the rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) that can be achieved at a Nash
equilibrium [9].
Proposition 1. If the rate pair (R1 , R2 ) is a Nash
2
K10 Pi
equilibrium point, then Ri ≥ Ri,min := C 1+K 2 Pj
20
for i = 1, 2.
Proof: Regardless of user j’s encoding scheme,
user i can always achieve a minimum rate Ri,min =
2
Ki0 Pi
C 1+K 2 Pj , by treating the signal from user j as
j0
noise. Thus, if user i gets a rate Ri strictly less than
Ri,min by the cooperative scheme, he has an incentive
to deviate from that cooperative scheme and get a higher
2
Ki0 Pi
rate. Thus, if (R1 , R2 ) is a NE, then Ri ≥ C 1+K 2 Pj .
j0

We denote the “cone” of potential equilibrium rate
pairs by Γ := {(R1 , R2 ) : R1 ≥ R1,min , R2 ≥ R2,min }.
Proposition 2. Suppose the decoding order is Di , 1 ≤
i ≤ 6. Any rate pair (R1 , R2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(Di )) is a Nash
equilibrium point.

Proposition 3. Suppose the decoding order is Di , 1 ≤
i ≤ 6. If a rate pair (R1 , R2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(Di )), then
(R1 , R2 ) is not a Nash equilibrium point.

Proof: First consider the decoding order D1 . Under
the decoding order D1 , the achievable region is given by
the following inequalities.

Proof: First we consider the decoding order D1 .
Let (R1 , R2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D1 )). In Proposition 1 we have
proved that if (R1 , R2 ) ∈ Γ, then (R1 , R2 ) is not a Nash
equilibrium point. So, it is sufﬁcient to consider a rate
pair (R1 , R2 ) such that (R1 , R2 ) ∈ Γ but (R1 , R2 ) ∈
B(C(D1 )), i.e., (R1 , R2 ) is in the interior of C(D1 ).
Suppose that (R1 , R2 ) is an equilibrium point. Since the
2
K10 P10
users are selﬁsh and rational, R10 = C 1+K 2 P20 and

2
R20 = C K20 P20 (otherwise users can increase their
rates upto this upper bound without affecting the other
user’s transmission). Since (R1 , R2 ) is in the interior,
ˆ
ˆ
R12 + R21 < R12 + R21 (If not, (R1 , R2 ) will be a
boundary point as argued in the proof of Proposition 2).
However, in this case, user 1 can re-distribute his power
to increase his rate R12 without affecting user 2’s rate,
as argued in the proof of Proposition 2. Thus, user 1
can unilaterally deviate and increase his utility. Thus,
(R1 , R2 ) cannot be an equilibrium point.
We can prove the same result for all other decoding
orders D2 , . . . , D6 by similar arguments. These proofs
are thus omitted.
Now, putting the Propositions 2 and 3, we have the
following characterization of the Nash equilibrium rates

(8)

Consider an (R1 , R2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(D1 )). At the boundˆ

ary point R12 + R21 = R12 + R21 . To prove this, ﬁrst

assume that R12 + R21 < R12 + R21 . Then user 1 can
decrease PU 1 and increase P12 in such a way that R12
ˆ
ˆ
increases but still R12 + R21 < R12 + R21 . This is
possible because the change in P12 and PU 1 will not
affect the rate R21 . Thus, R21 will remain the same and
R12 will increase. Thus R12 + R21 will increase. Note
that R10 and R20 will be unaffected by the change in
P12 and PU 1 . Thus user 2’s rate (R2 = R20 + R21 ) will
remain the same and user 1’s rate (R1 = R10 +R12 ) will

Theorem 1. Suppose the decoding order is Di , 1 ≤ i ≤
6. Then a rate pair (R1,Di , R2,Di ) is a Nash equilibrium
point if and only if (R1,Di , R2,Di ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(Di ))

Corollary 1. If the rate pair (R1 , R2 ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C) then
(R1 , R2 ) is a Nash equilibrium point.

The achievable region of the GGR channel, C, is
given by the convex hull of the achievable regions
C(Di ), 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Thus any point in C is obtained
by time sharing among the various decoding order as
explained in Section II-B. Once the receiver announces
α, each user decides their strategies for each of the
decoding order. Note that each user can also decide
their strategies for each decoding order just before the
beginning of each decoding order. Thus there will be
six decision making instants for each user and such a
formulation comes under dynamic games. However we
will be able to show that the equilibrium rates will not
change. We are omitting the discussion about dynamic
game formulation due to space constraints.
Now, using Theorem 1, we give the complete characterization of the Nash equilibrium region of the GGR
channel.

Proof: If (R1 , R2 ) ∈ B(C) then it can be achieved
only by time sharing among the rates (R1,Di , R2,Di )
such that (R1,Di , R2,Di ) ∈ B(C(Di )). Then, by Theorem 2 the result follows.
Remark: Not all equilibrium points are on the Paretooptimal boundary of the achievable region C. Since
any rate achieved by time sharing among the points of
B(C(Di )), 1 ≤ i ≤ 6, is an equilibrium point and some
decoding orders are inferior to others in some regions,
we can have Nash equilibrium points that are not on the
Pareto-optimal boundary of C.
IV. C ONCLUSION AND F URTHER W ORK
We have established that all rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) such
that Ri ≥ Ri,min , i = 1, 2 which are on the Paretooptimal boundary of the achievable region of the generalized Gaussian relay channel correspond to a NE of the
communication game between the users of the channel.
However these are not the only NE rate points. We have
showed that there are Nash equilibrium points in the
interior of the achievable region of the GGR channel. In
future work we will also generalize the results to more
than two users, and for other cooperative communication
schemes. Since the users can choose strategies before the
beginning of each decoding order

Theorem 2. For the GGR channel, a rate pair (R1 , R2 )
is a Nash equilibrium rate pair if and only if (R1 , R2 ) =
6
i=1 αi (R1,Di , R2,Di ) for some α := (α1 , . . . , α6 )
6
such that
i=1 αi = 1 where (R1,Di , R2,Di ) ∈ Γ ∩
B(C(Di )) for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 6.
Proof: If α := (α1 , . . . , α6 ) is the time sharing parameter vector and (R1,Di , R2,Di ) is the rate
i−1
i
pair achieved during the time ( j=1 αj , j=1 αj ] with
decoding order Di , then the net rate is (R1 , R2 ) =
6
i=1 αi (R1,Di , R2,Di ). Thus, by deﬁnition, any rate
pair (R1 , R2 ) ∈ C if and only if (R1 , R2 ) =
6
i=1 αi (R1,Di , R2,Di ) for some α := (α1 , . . . , α6 )
6
such that i=1 αi = 1 and (R1,Di , R2,Di ) ∈ C(Di ).
Assume that (R1,Di , R2,Di ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(Di )) for all i,
1 ≤ i ≤ 6. Then by Theorem 1 (R1,Di , R2,Di ) is a Nash
i−1
i
equilibrium point during the time ( j=1 αj , j=1 αj ]
and hence no user will deviate during this time. This is
true for 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 and hence for the entire time. Hence
6
the rate pair (R1 , R2 ) =
i=1 αi (R1,Di , R2,Di ) for
6
some α := (α1 , . . . , α6 ) such that i=1 αi = 1 where
(R1,Di , R2,Di ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(Di )) is a Nash equilibrium
point.
6
Now, let (R1 , R2 ) =
i=1 αi (R1,Di , R2,Di ) for
6
some α := (α1 , . . . , α6 ) such that
i=1 αi = 1 but
(R1,Dj , R2,Dj ) ∈ Γ ∩ B(C(Dj )) for some k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 6.
Then, by Theorem 1 (R1,Dk , R2,Dk ) is not a Nash
equilibrium point. Then user 1 or user 2 can have a
k−1
k
unilateral deviation during the time ( j=1 αj , j=1 αj ]
to increase his net rate. Thus, the rate pair (R1 , R2 ) =
6
i=1 αi (R1,Di , R2,Di ) is not a Nash equilibrium point.
