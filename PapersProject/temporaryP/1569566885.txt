established in [2], [3], [17].
In summary, for the point-to-point communication, Abelian
group codes are, in general, inferior to linear codes. But
for certain multiuser communication, they can outperform the
latter.
The next logical step is to characterize the performance limits of codes over non-abelian groups. It has been conjectured
by several authors that non-Abelian group codes are inferior
to Abelian group codes [8] [9] [13]. Moreover, they suggest
that asymptotically good group codes over non-abelian groups
may not exist. This motivates a loosening of the structure of
the code yet further.
In this work, we deﬁne a class of structured codes which
includes the class of group codes and has less structure
compared to group codes. We evaluate the performance of
such codes over the smallest non-Abelian group D6 and show
that these codes have a strictly better performance compared
to Abelian group codes for the point-to-point problem. We
then use these codes for the problem of computation over
MAC and show that these codes are superior to random
codes in certain cases. We use a combination of algebraic
and information-theoretic tools for this task. This observation
broadens our view to structured codes for possible use in
multi-terminal settings.

Abstract—In this paper, we show that good structured codes
over non-Abelian groups do exist. Speciﬁcally, we construct codes
over the smallest non-Abelian group D6 and show that the
performance of these codes is superior to the performance of
Abelian group codes of the same alphabet size. This promises
the possibility of using non-Abelian codes for multi-terminal
settings where the structure of the code can be exploited to gain
performance. We also show that for the problem of computation
over MAC, these codes are superior to random codes in certain
cases.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Algebraically structured codes are an important class of
codes in coding/information theory and communications and
evaluating the information-theoretic performance limits of
such codes has been an area of signiﬁcance [2], [5], [6],
[10], [12], [16]. It is well-known that linear codes achieve the
symmetric capacity of q-ary channels where q is a prime [7]
[6]. Linear codes can also be used to compress a binary source
losslessly down to its entropy [11]. Optimality of linear codes
for certain communication problems motivates the study of
algebraic-structured codes including Abelian and non-Abelian
group codes.
In [11] it has been shown that for some multi-terminal
communication settings, the average asymptotic performance
of the ensemble of structured codes can be better than that of
random codes. In recent years, such gains have been shown
for a wide class of multi-termianl problems [12], [14], [15].
Thus, characterization of the information theoretic performance limits of these codes became important. However, the
structure of the code restricts the encoder to abide by certain
algebraic rules. This causes the performance of such codes to
be inferior to random codes in some communication settings.
Linear codes are highly structured and for some problems in
information theory they cannot be optimal. Moreover, these
codes can only be deﬁned over alphabets of size a power of
a prime.
Group codes are a generalization of linear codes which are
algebraically structured and can be deﬁned for any alphabet.
These codes can outperform unstructured codes in certain
communication problems [12]. Group codes were ﬁrst studied
by Slepian [19] for the Gaussian channel. In [1], the capacity
of group codes for certain classes of channels has been
computed. Further results on the capacity of group codes were

The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we introduce our notation. In Section III, we deﬁne the ensemble of
codes and in Section IV, we analyze the performance of these
codes for the point-to-point problem. We then simplify this
ensemble in Section V and evaluate their performance for the
problem of computation over MAC in Section VI. We compare
the performance of the constructed codes to the performance
of Abelian group codes and random codes in Section VII and
we conclude in Section VIII.
II. P RELIMINARIES
1) Groups: A group is a set G equipped with a binary
operation “·” to form an algebraic structure. The group operation “·” must satisfy the group axioms (closure, associativity,
identity and invertibility). A group is called Abelian if its
operation is commutative and non-Abelian otherwise.
2) Group Codes: Given a group G, a group code C over
G with block length n is any subgroup of Gn [4], [10]. A

shifted group code over G, C + v is a translation of a group
code C by a ﬁxed vector v ∈ Gn .
3) Source and Channel Models: We consider discrete memoryless and stationary channels used without feedback. We
associate two ﬁnite sets X and Y with the channel as the
channel input and output alphabets. These channels can be
characterized by a conditional probability law W (y|x) for
x ∈ X and y ∈ Y . The set X admits the structure of
a ﬁnite Abelian group G of the same size. The channel is
speciﬁed by (G, Y , W ). Assuming a perfect source coding
block applied prior to the channel coding, the source of
information generates messages over the set {1, 2, . . . , M }
uniformly.
4) Achievability and Capacity: A transmission system with
parameters (n, M, τ ) for reliable communication over a given
channel (G, Y , W ) consists of an encoding mapping and a
decoding mapping e : {1, 2, . . . , M } → Gn , f : Y n →
{1, 2, . . . , M } such that for all m = 1, 2, . . . , M ,

Note that for two elements g, h in D6 , g · h may not be
equal to h · g. We construct the ensemble of codes over D6 in
a more complete version of this paper [18]. Here we directly
present the resulting ensemble of codes. Each code in this
k
ensemble has a rate of R = n log 6.

The capacity of the channel is deﬁned as the supremum of the

throughout the paper.
6) Dihedral Groups: A dihedral group of order 2p is the
group of symmetries of a regular p-gon, including reﬂections
and rotations and any combination of these operations. A
dihedral group can be represented as a quotient of a free group
as follows: D2p = x, y|xp = 1, y 2 = 1, xyxy = 1 . Dihedral
groups are among the simplest non-Abelian groups.
7) Notation: In our notation, O( ) is any function of such
that lim →0 O( ) = 0 and for a set A, |A| denotes its size
(cardinality).

III. A C LASS OF S TRUCTURED C ODES
Based on Forney’s analysis of group codes [10], we construct a class of structured codes which we call pseudo-group
codes. The complete description of such codes can be found
in a more complete version of this work [18]. For Abelian
groups, the deﬁnition of pseudo-group codes coincides with
the deﬁnition of group codes but for non-Abelian groups this
class is larger than the class of group codes; i.e. it includes all
group codes as well as some non-group codes. In this paper,
we use these codes for the smallest non-Abelian group D6 and
show that this loosening of the structure results in a better
performance. The generalization of the analysis to dihedral
groups D2p where p is a prime is relatively straight forward.
The group D6 with presentation D6 =
x, y|x3 =
2
1, y = 1, xyxy = 1 can be characterized by a set
{1, x, x2 , y, xy, x2 y} with the following table of operations:

We evaluate the performance of these codes using a random
coding argument in the next section.
IV. M AIN R ESULT
In this section we show the existence of good structured
codes over the non-Abelian group D6 by proving the following
theorem:
Theorem IV.1. For the channel (D6 , Y , W ), let X be a
uniform random variable over the channel input and let the
random variable [X] indicate the coset of {1, x, x2 } in D6
where X belongs to. i.e.
[X] =

2

{1, x, x2 }
{y, xy, x2 y}

if X ∈ {1, x, x2 }
if X ∈ {y, xy, x2 y}

Then the rate R∗ is achievable using pseudo-group codes over
D6 where
R∗ = min log2 6 − H(X|Y ),

Moreover, for a ﬁxed u, let Tm1 ,m2 (u) be the set of all u with
˜

˜

The rest of this section is devoted to give a sketch of the
proof of this theorem. A more complete version of this proof
can be found in [18].
Consider the class of pseudo-group codes over D6 of the form
(1) used for the channel (D6 , Y , W ). The set of messages is
D6 and for each message u ∈ Dk the encoder maps it to

c ∈ Dn where c = G(u) · B. At the receiver, after receiving

the channel output y ∈ Y n , the decoder looks for a message
u ∈ Dk such that c = G(ˆ) · B is jointly -typical with y

> 0 is arbitrary. If it ﬁnds a unique such c, it decodes y to

In the following two sections, we state some recent results
in this direction without proofs. These results will be published
in due course.
V. A S IMPLER C ONSTRUCTION
In Section III, we deﬁned the class of pseudo-group codes
based on Forney’s analysis of group codes and in Section
IV we showed that these codes have a good performance
for the point-to-point communication problem. In this section,
we introduce another class of codes over D6 with similar
properties as those of pseudo-group codes deﬁned in Section
III. The new class of pseudo-group codes deﬁned in this
section have the advantage of a simpler construction. This
enables us to use this ensemble in Section VI for the problem
of computation over MAC.
The new ensemble of codes is constructed as follows:
• For i = 1, · · · , n and j = 1, · · · , k, let

It turns out that this ensemble has the same average performance as the ensemble of codes deﬁned in Section III. i.e. it
can achieve the rate R∗ deﬁned in Theorem IV.1.

present two examples. In the ﬁrst example, we show that the

the rate achievable using Abelian group codes for the pointto-point problem. In the second example, we show that under
certain conditions, the achievable rate using non-Abelian codes
can be strictly larger than the rate achievable using random
codes for the problem of computation over MAC.

C. Comparison

We give an example where the capacity of group codes is
zero whereas the constructed code achieves a strictly positive
rate. Consider the channel depicted in Figure 3 where 1 = 0.1,
2 = 0.2 and 3 = 0.15. If we maximize over all possible la-

If we compare the two achievable rates for the point-topoint problem, we observe that for the case of Abelian group
codes there is an additional term in the minimization which can
be explained by the additional structure of the Abelian group
codes. Indeed, the pseudo-group code over D6 is additive
(homomorphic) with respect to the y generator and is not
homomorphic with respect to the x generator whereas Abelian
group codes are homomorphic with respect to both of their
generators. This means compared to Abelian Group codes, the
constructed codes gain a higher rate by reducing the structure.

We have shown that good structured codes over non-Abelian
groups do exist. We constructed codes over the smallest nonAbelian group D6 and showed that the performance of these
codes is superior to the performance of Abelian group codes
of the same alphabet size. We also showed that such codes can
be used for multi-terminal problems (such as computation over
MAC) and can outperform random codes in such settings.

belings of the channel input alphabet, it can be shown that both
coding schemes achieve the symmetric capacity of the channel
which is equal to 0.0139 bits per channel use. However, if
the labels are assumed to be ﬁxed, the achievable rate using
pseudo-group codes is equal to R∗ = min(0.0139, 0.0227) =
0.0139 and the achievable rate using Abelian group codes is
equal to R = min(0.0139, 0.0227, 0) = 0. Indeed using the
converse provided in [17] we can show that the capacity of
Abelian group codes over this channel is equal to zero. We
observe that for this channel, the codes over D6 outperform
the codes over Z6 .

B. Example 2: Computation Over MAC
Consider the channel depicted in Figure 4 where X,
Z and W take values form D6 and Y is binary.
The channel WY |W is characterized the input-output reX
D6 Multiplier

W =X ·Z

WY |W

Y

Z

Fig. 4: MAC for computation of D6 operation.
lation Y = W · N where N is a random noise
taking values from {1, x, x2 , y, xy, x2 y} with probabilities [ 0.1606 0.1396 0.3545 0.0049 0.0230 0.3173 ]
respectively. Note that the channel WY |W is symmetric. The
achievable rate using non-Abelian codes can be computed as
Rnew = min(R1 , R2 , R3 ) = 0.3936 where R1 = 0.5500,
R2 = 0.4756 and R3 = 0.3936. The achievable rate using
random codes is equal to
Rrandom =

I(XZ; Y ) = 0.2729

We observe that for this example, non-Abelian codes outperform random codes.
