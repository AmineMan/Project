many secondary nodes sharing the spectrum with the primary,
and also, relaying is limited to single node relaying. In [5],
cognitive relaying has been studied for an uplink where a
single dedicated cognitive relay forwards unsuccessful packets
from source nodes during their idle slots under the assumption
of perfect sensing. In [6], a network consisting of a primary
TDMA uplink with some dedicated cognitive relays to help
the primary, and secondary Ad-Hoc network is considered
with stable throughput as performance criterion. However,
only the case of perfect sensing of the primary nodes was
considered and the analysis is limited to collision channel
model for reception which does not capture the multipacket
reception (MPR) capability of modern receivers and is not a
realistic model for Ad-Hoc network where different nodes can
be largely separated in space and interference is likely to be
small. Furthermore, only single node relaying was considered
despite the presence of several dedicated relays in the system.
In this paper, we study the effect of secondary interference
on the primary’s stable throughput which may occur due to
incorrect sensing or even with perfect sensing in the presence of malicious attacks. We adopt the physical interference
model for reception (SINR threshold model) in contrast with
the oversimpliﬁed collision model to calculate the maximum
transmission power and channel access probabilities that secondary users can employ without affecting the primary’s queue
stability. As a method for mitigating the negative effects
of secondary interference, we propose a multinode relaying
protocol that forces all the secondary nodes that can decode
a primary unsuccessful packet to relay that packet using
orthogonal space-time block codes [7] and it is shown that
under this protocol, the more secondary nodes present in the
network, the more beneﬁt for the primary in terms of his
maximum stable throughput due to diversity and/or power gain
introduced while the secondary nodes might beneﬁt by having
access to a larger fraction of idle slots.
The paper is organized as follows: In section II, we describe
the system model. In sections III and IV, we study the primary
node’s stable throughput in the perfect and imperfect sensing
cases respectively. In section V, we propose and analyze
the relaying protocol to beneﬁt of the large population of
secondary nodes. Section VI presents the numerical results
and in section VII, we conclude the paper.
The proofs are omitted due to space limitations but can be
found in [8].

Abstract—We consider a cognitive network consisting of one
primary source-destination pair and N secondary cognitive
source-destination pairs that randomly access the channel during
the primary user’s idle slots. We ﬁrst study the effect of the
secondary nodes’ transmission parameters such as power and
channel access probabilities on the stable throughput of the
primary node. If the sensing is perfect, then the secondary nodes
do not interfere with the primary node and thus do not affect its
stable throughput. In case of imperfect sensing, it is shown that
if the primary node’s arrival rate is less than some calculated
value, then the secondary transmissions do not affect its queueing
stability; otherwise, the secondary nodes should regulate their
transmission parameters to reduce their interference on the
primary. Finally, we propose a multinode relaying protocol based
on distributed space-time orthogonal block codes, that uses the
secondary nodes as relays of the primary node’s trafﬁc to
compensate for the interference they might cause. In this case,
for appropriate modulation scheme and under perfect sensing,
it is shown that the more secondary nodes in the system, the
better for the primary user in terms of his stable throughput.
Meanwhile, the secondary nodes might beneﬁt from relaying by
having access to a larger number of idle slots becoming available
to them due to the increase of the service rate of the primary.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cognitive Multiple Access was proposed as a possible solution for spectrum scarcity as it was shown that large portions
of the licensed spectrum remain idle for long proportions
of time [1], [2]. With cognitive radio technology, secondary
(unlicensed) users are allowed to access the licensed spectrum
if sensed to be idle. At the same time, as the sensing procedure
may be erroneous, some measures must be taken to protect
the primary (licensed) users from possible interference due to
sensing errors at the secondary nodes.
Cognitive radio has been studied from an information theoretic point of view in [3]. However, information theoretic
analysis does not take into account the bursty nature of the
trafﬁc which is essential in studying network layer aspects
such as the stable throughput and the average delay. The
stable throughput of a simple cognitive network consisting
of one primary and one secondary source-destination pairs
was studied in [4], under the SINR threshold model for
reception with relaying for perfect and erroneous sensing.
However, such simpliﬁed model does not capture the effect
of the potential interference induced in a real network with

Under the saturation assumption of the secondary queues, there
is no issue of stability except for the primary queue. The
primary queue evolves as:

II. S YSTEM M ODEL

•

The system consists of one primary source-destination pair
and a secondary Ad-Hoc network consisting of N secondary
source-destination pairs. All nodes have buffers of inﬁnite
capacity to store the packets to be transmitted. Time is slotted
with packet duration equal to one slot duration. The arrival
process to the primary node is assumed to be stationary
with an average rate of λP packets/slot, while the secondary
nodes are assumed to be saturated to avoid queueing interaction. Throughout the paper, we designate the primary source
node with SP , the primary destination with DP and the ith
secondary source node with Si , where i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N }.
The primary source node transmits at power PP while all
secondary nodes transmit at common power P0 .
The distance between node i and node j is denoted by rij ,
where i ∈ {Sk |k = P, 1, 2, ..., N } and j ∈ {DP , Sk |k =
1, 2, ..., N }. For instance, rSi DP denotes the distance between
the ith secondary source node and the primary destination
node. The path loss exponent is assumed to be equal to α
throughout the network. The link between the (i, j) pair of
nodes is subject to stationary Rayleigh block fading with
2
fading coefﬁcients hij ∼ CN (0, σij ) which are independent
among links. All nodes are subject to independent additive
white complex Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance
N0 . To properly model the interference throughout the network, we adopt the SINR threshold model where node j is
able to successfully decode a packet if the received signal-tointerference plus noise ratio (SINR) exceeds some threshold
βj . Upon the success or failure of a packet reception at a
node, an instantaneous and error free Acknowledgment/NonAcknowledgment (ACK/NACK) message is fedback to the
corresponding transmitter.
Both the primary and the secondary users transmit over the
same frequency band where the primary user has the priority
for transmission, while the secondary users are restricted to
use the idle slots of the primary. At the beginning of each
slot, secondary nodes sense the channel and only if a slot is
detected to be idle, do they access the channel in a random
access way. A secondary node transmits with probability q
whenever it detects an idle slot.
Secondary nodes should be “transparent” to the primary
in the sense that their transmissions should not affect some
performance criterion (here, the queueing stability) of the
primary node. If the sensing is perfect, the secondary nodes
do not interfere with the primary and can employ any transmission parameters (power/channel access probability) without
affecting the primary. However, if the sensing is not perfect,
the secondary nodes must limit their interference on the
primary node by controlling their transmission parameters. In
this paper, we restrict the analysis to the following symmetric
case, but the analysis of the general non-symmetric case can
be handled similarly [8]; speciﬁcally, we assume:

In this case, secondary nodes are able to perfectly identify
the primary idle slots where they can access the channel from
the busy slots where they must remain silent.

IV. I MPERFECT S ENSING C ASE
Due to fading and other channel impairments, the secondary
nodes may misidentify the idle slots and hence interfere with
the primary.
Two errors may occur while sensing the channel, namely,
false alarm and misdetection errors. False alarm occurs when
the primary node is idle but it is sensed to be busy. Clearly,
false alarm error does not affect the primary’s stable throughput but degrades the throughput of the secondary nodes.
Misdetection occurs when the primary node is busy but it is
sensed to be idle. Secondary nodes will then transmit with the
primary and may lead to the instability of its queue.
In our case, the probability of the misdetection event Pe
is the same for all secondary nodes by symmetry of the
conﬁguration.
The stability condition of the primary queue in the imperfect
sensing case is given by λP < µP where:

that (1 − qPe )N is the probability that none of the secondary

hence, using random access as a multiple access protocol in

From proposition 1, we can draw some important conclusions:
(i) states that the effect of the interference due to erroneous
sensing at the secondary nodes is the degradation of the service
rate of the primary licensed user. (ii),(iii) and (iv) reveal that
unless a → ∞ i.e. either PP → ∞ or P0 → 0, the primary
node cannot achieve its maximum service rate µmax that is
P
achieved in the case of perfect sensing. Also, for ﬁxed PP ,
secondary nodes have a maximum power - possibly inﬁnite
if λP < µmax (1 − qPe )N - at which they can transmit while
P
remaining transparent to the primary node. Moreover, even
if the interference of the secondary nodes is very high (case
of P0 → ∞), the primary node can still achieve a portion
(1 − qPe )N of its maximum service rate µmax . Finally, (v),
P
(vi) and (vii) show that for ﬁxed PP and P0 , the secondary
nodes can control their interference level on the primary by
adjusting their transmission probabilities q which is sometimes
easier to implement than power control.
For λP < µP to be satisﬁed, we can solve for minimum

V. R ELAYING IN THE P ERFECT S ENSING C ASE
Relaying represents an incentive for the primary nodes
to share their channel resources with secondary users if it
beneﬁts them. In this section, we propose and analyze a simple
multinode relaying protocol in the perfect sensing case which
serves as an upper bound for the imperfect sensing case as well
as a good approximation for systems employing cooperative
and sophisticated sensing techniques.
A. Relaying Protocol
The relaying protocol achieves a throughput gain with no
channel state information (CSI) about hSk DP fading coefﬁcients available at the secondary nodes by using Distributed
Orthogonal Space-Time Block Code (D-OSTBC). That is each
of the secondary nodes that is able to successfully decode a primary packet will mimic an antenna in a regular STC setting of
a multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. Such OSTBC
always exists for one dimensional signal constellations for any
number of relaying nodes [10]. In this case, these OSTBC
schemes achieve full diversity gain and/or power gain at
coding rate =1 while ensuring simple decoding rule based only
on linear processing at the receiver. Hence, the assumption of
one dimensional signal constellation leads to both analytical
tractability as well as simplicity of implementation by avoiding
variable rate systems needed in case of two dimensional
constellations transmitted using orthogonal space-time block
codes [11] or joint decoding and partial diversity gain in quasiorthogonal full rate space-time codes [12].
Each of the relaying nodes must know which antenna it mimics
in the underlying STC used which can be achieved either by
coordination between the secondary nodes or by prior node
indexing and observing ACK/NACK packets generated by the
secondary nodes regarding each primary packet.
The relaying protocol works as follows: If the primary node
transmits a packet and is unsuccessful while one or more
secondary nodes are able to successfully decode that packet,
then these secondary nodes send an ACK message to the
primary and the primary node releases the packet from its
queue. We assume that this ACK will also be heard by all the
secondary nodes and thus the secondary nodes which could
not receive that packet will abstain from transmission until
that packet is successfully delivered to the primary destination
and thus avoid interfering with the primary’s relayed packets.
In the next available primary idle slot, the secondary source
nodes which were able to decode the packet will transmit it
using D-OSTBC as described above. The primary packets are
given priority for transmission, i.e., a secondary source node

relaying the primary’s packets and the rest for secondary

in [8] that for a single secondary node, either both the primary
and the secondary beneﬁt from relaying or none. Please refer

primary packets to relay and none of the other secondary nodes

VII. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK
In this paper, we studied the effect of the interference
introduced on a primary user sharing the spectrum with some
secondary nodes because of erroneous sensing. It is shown
that if the primary arrival rate is less than some ﬁnite value,
there is no need for controlling the secondary nodes’ transmission parameters (power/transmission probabilities), otherwise,
these parameters must be appropriately regulated. It is shown
that if the secondary nodes are forced to relay the primary’s
packets, then the primary beneﬁts from relaying and meanwhile, the secondary nodes might beneﬁt by increasing the
fraction of idle slots available for their transmissions. Future
work includes the analysis of the relaying protocol in the

access probability q or by enhancing the sensing performance
to reduce Pe . Figure 2 plots the normalized maximum stable

be represented by the integral: Γ(s, x) = x ts−1 e−t dt.
Proposition 2:
The success probability Ps as given by (8) is strictly
increasing with N . Moreover, as N → ∞, Ps → 1.
Proposition 3:
N
Only if µmax < Ps [1−(1−Pd ) ] , the maximum possible arrival

Pd
rate at the primary node that keeps the system stable as given
by (6) increases compared to the case of no-relaying.
A sufﬁcient condition is to have µmax < Ps which is clearly
P
satisﬁed for some N , possibly large.
Hence, the beneﬁt for the primary user achieved by relaying
increases with the number of secondary nodes sharing the
spectrum. If the number of secondary nodes in the network
cannot satisfy the condition in proposition 3, then increasing
the secondary nodes’ power (to increase Ps ) will help
satisfying that condition for a smaller number of secondary
relaying nodes (See Figures 3 and 4).
It should be noted that one node relaying (N = 1) always
leads to higher primary stable throughput rate if:

(10)

In other words, if the primary and secondary nodes transmit
at the same power, then one node relaying always helps if the
channel between secondary source and primary destination is
on average better than the channel between the primary source
and primary destination as was shown in [5].
Finally, the effect of relaying on the secondary nodes can
be intuitively understood by noting that by increasing the
