be helpful in increasing the degrees of freedom (DoF) for
broadcast multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) networks,
even if the channel changes independently over time. Several
interesting extensions of [2] have been considered recently,
which include the two-user MIMO broadcast channel (BC)
[3], the three user MIMO-BC [3], [4] and the two-user MIMO
interference channel (IC) [5].
A very relevant question is that whether channel output
feedback (FB) can be helpful with delayed CSI or not. For
the case of the MIMO-BC, this question is answered in a
negative way in [3]: i.e., having output feedback, in addition to
delayed CSI does not increase the DoF region of the MIMOBC, even though it enlarges the capacity region. However,
FB if available in addition to delayed CSI can increase the
DoF for the MIMO interference channel (MIMO-IC). This
is shown explicitly in [6], where the DoF region of the twouser MIMO-IC is completely characterized in the presence of
FB and delayed CSI (also see the parallel work in [7], which
reports similar results). The study of the impact of delayed CSI
on the DoF of X-channels was initiated in [8]. It is shown that
for the two-user X-channel, a sum DoF of 8/7 is achievable
with delayed CSI. The impact of FB on the sum DoF for the
two-user X-channel and the three-user IC is also explored in
[8]. It is shown that a sum DoF of 6/5 is achievable for the
three-user IC with FB alone. Moreover, the optimal sum DoF
of the two-user X-channel with FB is shown to be 4/3. It is
worth noting that for the single-antenna two-user X-channel,
FB alone is sufﬁcient to achieve the outer bound of 4/3, which
holds also for the stronger setting of FB and delayed CSI.
The focus of this paper is on MIMO X-channels with output
feedback and delayed CSI. Throughout the paper, global CSI
is assumed to be present at all the receivers. The sum DoF
of the MIMO X-channel is characterized for the symmetric
antenna conﬁguration, with M antennas at each transmitter
and N antennas at each receiver. It is shown that the sum
DoF of the MIMO X-channel equals the sum DoF of a
MIMO-BC with 2M transmit antennas and N antennas at
each of the receivers. This result highlights the fact that in
the presence of output feedback and delayed CSI, there is
no DoF loss due to the distributed nature of the M -antenna
transmitters. We also focus on the setting of the K-user Xchannel with a single antenna at each terminal. For this model
under the assumption of global output feedback and delayed
CSI, the sum DoF is also shown to be the same as that of a
K-receiver multiple-input single output (MISO) BC [2] with

Abstract—The sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of the two-user
MIMO X-channel is characterized in the presence of output
feedback and delayed channel state information (CSI). The
number of antennas at each transmitters is assumed to be M
and the number of antennas at each of the receivers is assumed
to be N . It is shown that the sum DoF of the two-user MIMO
X-channel is the same as the sum DoF of a two-user MIMO
broadcast channel with 2M transmit antennas, and N antennas
at each receiver. Hence, for this symmetric antenna conﬁguration,
there is no performance loss in the sum degrees of freedom due to
the distributed nature of the transmitters. This result highlights
the usefulness of feedback and delayed CSI for the MIMO Xchannel.
The K-user X-channel with a single antenna at each transmitter and each receiver is also studied. In this network, each
transmitter has a message intended for each receiver. For this
network, it is shown that the sum DoF with partial output
feedback alone is at least 2K/(K + 1). This lower bound is
strictly better than the best lower bound known for the case of
delayed CSI assumption for all values of K.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In currently deployed wireless networks, multiple pairs of
users wish to communicate with each other over a shared
medium. Due to the inherent broadcast nature of the wireless
medium, interference is one of the main bottlenecks in efﬁcient
utilization of communication resources. Several approaches
to combat interference have been proposed in the literature
such as treating interference as noise, or decoding interference
and subtracting it from the received signal. However, for
multiple users, such approaches can be sub-optimal in general.
Recently, more sophisticated schemes, such as interference
alignment and (aligned) interference neutralization have been
proposed for managing interference (see [1] for an excellent
tutorial and the references therein). However, these techniques
are usually based on availability of instantaneous (perfect) and
global channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters. Such
an assumption is perhaps not very realistic in practical systems,
when dealing with fast fading links.
The pioneering work in [2] considers a model in which the
perfect CSI assumption is relaxed to delayed CSI, a setting in
which CSI is available in a delayed manner at the transmitters.
Interestingly, it is shown in [2] that even delayed CSI can

of global feedback is then relaxed to partial (local) feedback,
in which receiver j sends feedback only to transmitter j, for
j = 1, . . . , K. For this model, it is shown that the sum DoF
is lower bounded by 2K/(K + 1). The interest of this lower
bound is that it is strictly larger than the best known lower
bound for the delayed CSI setting [9]. Finally, for the K-user
IC with a single antenna at each terminal and global feedback
and delayed CSI, the sum DoF is shown to be lower bounded

by K/(2+ 2 +. . .+ K ). Interestingly, this shows that for large
values of K, the behavior of the sum DoF of the K-user BC,
K-user X-channel and the K-user IC is similar in the presence
of global FB and delayed CSI.

D ELAYED CSI

We consider the two-user (M, M, N, N )-MIMO X-channel
with fast fading under the assumptions of (A-I) noiseless
channel output feedback from receiver n to transmitter n, for
n = 1, 2 and (A-II) the availability of delayed CSI at the
transmitters (see Figure 1). We denote the transmitters by Tx1
and Tx2 and the receivers by Rx1 and Rx2 . The channel
outputs at the receivers are given as follows:

(1)
(2)

This bound follows from [3] by letting the transmitters cooperate and subsequently using the bound for the MIMO broadcast
channel with feedback and delayed CSI.
We present our main result in the following theorem.

Y2 (t) = H21 (t)X1 (t) + H22 (t)X2 (t) + Z2 (t),
where Xn (t) is the signal transmitted by nth transmitter Txn ;
Hij (t) ∈ CN ×M denotes the channel matrix between the ith
receiver and jth transmitter; and Zn (t) ∼ CN (0, IN ), for n =
1, 2, is the additive noise at receiver n. The power constraints
are E||Xn (t)||2 ≤ P , for ∀ n, t.
For the X-channel, there are four independent messages,
one from each transmitter to each receiver. In particular, we
denote by Wi,j the message from transmitter i to receiver
j. We denote by H(t) = {H11 (t), H12 (t), H21 (t), H22 (t)}
the collection of all channel matrices at time t. Furthermore,
Ht−1 = {H(1), H(2), . . . , H(t − 1)} denotes the set of all
channel matrices up till time (t − 1). Similarly, we denote by
t−1
Yn = {Yn (1), . . . , Yn (t − 1)} the set of all channel outputs
at receiver n up till time (t − 1). A coding scheme with block
length T for the MIMO X-channel with feedback and delayed
CSI consists of a sequence of encoding functions

The converse follows immediately from the MIMO broadcast
channel bounds in (1) and (2). We complete the proof for
Theorem 1 in the next section by presenting coding schemes
with feedback and delayed CSI. We note that for M = N = 1,
Theorem 1 recovers a result of [8], in which the sum DoF of
the single antenna X channel was shown to be 4/3.
A. Coding Schemes
1) Coding scheme for 2M ≤ N : For 2M ≤ N , we have
DoFsum = 2M . We shall only outline the coding scheme
since it is straightforward. To this end, we will show the
achievability of the following quadruple:
(d11 , d12 , d22 , d21 ) = (M, 0, 0, M ),

(4)

which implies that there are M symbols from transmitter 1
and M information symbols from transmitter 2, both intended
for receiver 1. Hence, coding for this system is equivalent to
coding for a MIMO multiple access channel, for which the
achievability follows from standard results.

1, at the end of phase 2, receiver 2 requires 2M N − N 2
additional equations in v-variables for successful decoding
of 2M N information symbols. Furthermore, upon receiving
feedback from receiver 1, transmitter 1 has access to N 2
additional equations in v-variables. Since 2M ≤ 2N , we have
2M N − N 2 ≤ N 2 , i.e., in this case transmitter 1 has enough
information, which if somehow can be supplied to receiver
2 will guarantee successful decoding of v-symbols. Let us
denote these (2M N − N 2 ) by v. Similar to the end of phase
1, transmitter 2 can also reconstruct the side-information vsymbols. At the end of this phase, both transmitters 1 and 2
have access to the side-information symbols (u, v). This is
the key step behind the achievability proof, i.e., the common
availability of side-information symbols before phase 3.

that is, there are M N information symbols at each transmitter
for each receiver to be sent over (2M + N ) channel uses. Let
us denote

as the symbols intended for receiver 2. Note that the symbols
(u11 , v12 ) are present at transmitter 1, and the symbols
(u21 , v22 ) are present at transmitter 2, i.e., the origin of
information symbols is distributed in contrast to the MIMO
broadcast channel. The scheme operates over three phases
described as below:

Phase 3: This phase operates over (2M − N ) channel uses.
The goal is to send u to receiver 1 and v to receiver 2. Note
that from phase 1, receiver 2 has access to u, and from phase
2, receiver 1 has access to v. Recall that each u and v are of
length 2M N − N 2 . Let us denote
u = [˜1 , . . . , u2M N −N 2 ],
u
˜

Phase 1: This phase uses N channel uses. In every channel
use, transmitter 1 sends fresh information symbols for receiver
1, and transmitter 2 sends fresh information symbols intended
for receiver 1. Note that, our choice of the duration for this
phase guarantees that all 2M N information symbols in u11
and u21 are transmitted exactly once and at one antenna. At
the end of phase 1, receiver 1 has N 2 linearly independent
equations in 2M N variables almost surely. Whereas, receiver
2 has N 2 linearly independent equations in same 2M N uvariables.

Using these, both transmitters can compute

(9)

which is the element-wise summation of the u and v sequences. The transmitters send each of these symbols exactly
once on an antenna. In particular, we have a total of 2M
transmit antennas and (2M −N ) channel uses, i.e., this scheme
is feasible as long as
2M N − N 2 ≤ 2M (2M − N )

At the end of phase 1, receiver 1 requires 2M N − N 2
additional equations in u-variables for successful decoding of
2M N information symbols. Note that upon receiving feedback
from receiver 2, transmitter 2 has access to N 2 additional
equations in the u-variables. Since 2M ≤ 2N , we have
2M N − N 2 ≤ N 2 , i.e., transmitter 2 has enough information,
which if somehow can be supplied to receiver 1 will guarantee
successful decoding of the u-symbols. Let us denote these
(2M N −N 2 ) symbols by u. More importantly, upon receiving
feedback from receiver 1, transmitter 1 can subtract out the
contribution from u11 , and decode u21 (this is possible since
u21 has M symbols, the feedback vector is of length N and we
have M ≤ N ). Subsequently, having the CSI of the ﬁrst block,
transmitter 1 can reconstruct the side-information u available
at transmitter 2. To summarize, feedback and delayed CSI
serve a dual purpose for this setting: not only does it provide
side-information at transmitter 2 (for future use), it also lets
transmitter 1 reconstruct the same side-information.

(10)

which is true since N ≤ 2M . At the end of phase 3, receiver
1 gets (2M − N )N equations in 2(2M N − N 2 ) variables.
However, receiver 1 already knows half of these variables,
namely v variables from phase 2, and hence it is left with
˜
˜
2M N − N 2 equations in 2M N − N 2 u-variables. Using
these and the information from phase 1 (i.e., N 2 equations of
phase 1), receiver 1 can decode all 2M N symbols. Similarly,
decoder 2 can also decode a total of 2M N information
symbols.
To illustrate this scheme by an example, consider the case
when N = 3, M = 2, and DoFsum = 4M N/(2M + N ) =
24/7. Phase 1 operates over 3 channel uses and at its end,
receiver 1 has 9 equations in 12 u-variables (6 originating
from transmitter 1 and 6 from transmitter 2). Similarly, at the
end of phase 2, receiver 2 has 9 equations in 12 v-variables (6
originating from transmitter 1 and 6 from transmitter 2). For
this example, there are (2M N − N 2 ) = 3 side-information
symbols intended for receiver 1 (let us denote these additional
symbols by u1 , u2 , u3 ) and three side information symbols for
˜ ˜ ˜
receiver 2 (denoted these symbols by v1 , v2 , v3 ). In phase 3,

Phase 2: This phase uses N channel uses. In every channel use, transmitter 1 sends fresh information symbols for
receiver 2, and transmitter 2 sends fresh information symbols
intended for receiver 2. At the end of phase 2, receiver 2
has N 2 linearly independent equations in 2M N variables v22
and v12 . Whereas, receiver 1 has N 2 linearly independent
equations in the same 2M N v-variables. Similar to phase

to u1 , u2 , u3 from phase 1. Therefore, phase 3 (which is

of duration 2M − N = 1) essentially provides receiver 1
with (2M − N )N = 3 equations in u1 , u2 , u3 symbols and
˜ ˜ ˜
similarly, receiver 2 gets (˜1 , v2 , v3 ). Using information from
v ˜ ˜
phases 1 and 3, receiver 1 can decode 12 information symbols.
Similarly, using information from phases 2 and 3, receiver 2
is able to decode 12 information symbols.
Remark 1: We now give the intuition as to why the total
DoF for the MIMO X-channel turns out to be the same as
that for the MIMO broadcast channel. This is illuminated
in phase 3, which requires complementary broadcasting of
side-information symbols. In particular, we need to transmit
2M N − N 2 symbols to receiver 1 and 2M N − N 2 symbols
to receiver 2. However, to attain this goal, we have a total of
(2M − N ) channel uses allotted for phase 3 and distributed
transmitters equipped with M antennas each. The feasibility
of this scheme is crucially dependent on the omniscience
of these side-information symbols at both transmitters. As
we have shown, feedback and delayed CSI guarantee the
common availability of these side-information symbols at both
the transmitters, effectively creating a 2M -antenna MIMO
broadcast channel for phase 3.
3) Coding scheme for 2N ≤ 2M : For this case, we have
DoFsum = 4N/3. The scheme for this case is a simple
variation as in the previous section and only output feedback
sufﬁces. In the ﬁrst channel use, transmitters 1 and 2 send fresh
information symbols intended for receiver 1 on N antennas
(which is possible since N ≤ M ). In the second channel
use, transmitters 1 and 2 send fresh information symbols
intended for receiver 2 on N antennas. Each receiver has N
equations in 2N variables, and each receiver requires N more
equations for successful decoding. In the third channel use,
transmitter 1 uses feedback from second channel use (which
is side information for receiver 1) and transmitter 2 uses
feedback from the ﬁrst channel use (which is side information
for receiver 1). It is clear that at the end of three channel uses,
each receiver can decode 2N symbols.

receivers. The proof of Theorem 2 is rather straightforward
and is immediate from [2]. To note this, we can proceed by
using a coding scheme consisting of several phases. The ﬁrst
phase is comprised of K channel uses. During the ﬁrst phase,
in each channel use, all transmitters send information for a
ﬁxed receiver. At the end of phase 1, upon receiving global
feedback, each transmitter can decode all information symbols,
thus creating a virtual MISO broadcast channel. The coding
for the subsequent phases follows as in [2].
In the following theorem, we state a lower bound on the
sum DoF for the K-user X-channel with partial feedback.
Theorem 3: The sum DoF of the single-antenna K-user
X-channel with partial feedback is lower bounded as follows:
2K
.
(13)
K +1
We note that this bound is tight for K = 2, for which we
achieve the MISO broadcast channel bound of 4/3 [8]. We
also note here that unlike the case for global feedback, the
lower bound with partial feedback does not scale with K,
the number of users. Nevertheless, the lower bound stated in
Theorem 3 is strictly better than the best known lower bound
for the case with delayed CSI alone [9] for all values of K.
However, without a matching converse, we cannot claim the
optimality of this lower bound.

A. Coding for the 3-user X-channel
Before presenting the proof for Theorem 3, we illustrate the
coding scheme for the K = 3 user X-channel. For this case,
we will show the achievability of 9/6, i.e., we show that a
total of 9 information symbols can be transmitted in 6 channel
uses. We denote an information symbol as sij if it originates
at transmitter i and is intended for receiver j, i, j = 1, 2, 3. In
particular, for this example, we have the following notation:
• s11 , s21 , s31 : symbols intended for receiver 1.
• s12 , s22 , s32 : symbols intended for receiver 2.
• s13 , s23 , s33 : symbols intended for receiver 3.
Transmission occurs over two phases. Phase 1 is of duration
3, and phase 2 is duration 3 (see Figure 2).
Phase 1: During this phase, at time t, transmitters 1, 2
and 3, send s1t , s2t and s3t respectively, for t = 1, 2, 3.
Note that for recovery of the three symbols s11 , s21 , s31
at receiver 1, two more linearly independent equations are
required. These correspond to symbols (A2 (1), A3 (1)) which
need to be delivered to receiver 1. Similarly, the symbol pair
(A1 (2), A3 (2)) needs to be delivered to receiver 2, and the
symbol pair (A1 (3), A2 (3)) to receiver 3.
Phase 2: In this phase we will show that it is possible to
deliver the two complementary symbols to each of the respective receiver in three channel uses. Due to partial feedback
from phase 1, transmitter j has access to Aj (1), Aj (2) and
Aj (3), for j = 1, 2, 3. The coding in this phase works as
follows: at t = 4, transmitter 1 sends A1 (2) and transmitter
2 sends A2 (1), whereas transmitter 3 remains silent. This
enables receiver 1 to obtain A1 (2) and receiver 2 to obtain
A1 (2). At t = 5, transmitter 1 sends A1 (3), transmitter 3 sends

III. K- USER X- CHANNEL WITH O UTPUT F EEDBACK
In this section, we focus on the K-user X-channel. In
this model, we assume that each transmitter and receiver is
equipped with a single antenna. We study two models with
different assumptions on the availability of feedback signals:
a) Global feedback: channel output feedback is present from
all K receivers to all K transmitters, and b) Partial feedback:
transmitter k receives feedback only from receiver k.

global feedback is given as follows:

1 to obtain A3 (1) and receiver 3 to obtain A1 (3). Finally, at
t = 6, transmitter 2 sends A2 (3), transmitter 3 sends A3 (2)
and transmitter 1 remains silent. Consequently, receiver 2 gets
A3 (2) and receiver 3 gets A2 (3). Hence, at the end of this
phase, each receiver has 3 linearly independent equations in 3
information symbols and the decoding is successful.

feedback and delayed CSI, all the K interference components
{I1 , . . . , IK } can be recovered at each of the transmitters, thus
creating a virtual MISO-BC. In the next phase, we use the
scheme of [2] to send the component Ij to receiver j. Hence,
the rate of this scheme is given as K/(1 + K/DoFBC (K)).
As a consequence of Theorems 2 and 4, the behavior of the
MISO-BC, the K-user X-channel and the K-user IC are the
same for large values of K.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
The usefulness of feedback (FB) when available in addition
to delayed CSI has been illustrated by showing that the sum
DoF of the symmetric MIMO X-channel is the same as the
sum DoF of the MIMO-BC. A similar result has also been
shown for the K-user single-antenna X-channel. The result of
Theorem 3 also shows that partial output FB yields a larger
sum DoF when compared to the setting of delayed CSI.
Moreover, it has been shown that the scaling behavior of the
sum DoF for the K-user IC in the presence of global FB and
delayed CSI is the same as that of the K-user MISO-BC.

B. Coding for the K-user X-channel
To show the achievability of 2K/(K +1), we will show that
it is possible to transmit K 2 symbols in K + K(K−1) channel
2
uses. As in case for K = 3, there are two phases. Phase 1 is
of duration K, in which, at time t, each transmitter sends an
information symbol intended for receiver t, for t = 1, . . . , K.
Hence, a total of K 2 symbols are transmitted over this phase,
with a total of K symbols intended for each receiver. At the
end of this phase, each receiver requires (K − 1) additional
equations for decoding the K information symbols, i.e., there
are a total of K(K − 1) additional symbols to be delivered.
Mimicking the scheme for K = 3, we create pairs of these
K(K − 1) symbols and reliably transmit these in K(K − 1)/2
channel uses. Hence, phase 2 is of duration K(K − 1)/2.
Therefore, this scheme can achieve the following sum DoF:

We note here that the proposed scheme only requires channel
output feedback from receiver j to transmitter j, and no CSI
(not even delayed) is required at any of the transmitters.
IV. K- USER IC: F EEDBACK AND D ELAYED CSI
In this section, we focus on the K-user IC. Given the scaling
behavior for the X-channel in Theorem 2, a natural question
arises: does the sum DoF for the K-user IC scale with K in
the presence of global feedback and delayed CSI? We answer
this question in the afﬁrmative in the following theorem.
Theorem 4: The sum DoF of the K-user IC with global
feedback and delayed CSI is lower bounded as follows:

To show the achievability, we operate over two phases. In
the ﬁrst phase, all transmitters send information symbols
simultaneously. The output at receiver j is a combination of the
symbol from transmitter j and an interference component, Ij ,
which is combination of the other (K −1) symbols. Via global
