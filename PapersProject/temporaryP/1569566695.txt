and Linial, London, Rabinovich [10] show that for the problem
of k-unicast in undirected networks, ﬂow solutions approach
the edge-cut bounds up to a factor of Θ(log k). There has
also been discovered a semi-deﬁnite programming relaxation
approach that allows√ approximation of edge-cut bounds
an
up to a factor of Θ( log k log log k) [11]. Interestingly, for
undirected networks, edge-cut bounds can be derived from the
vertex bipartition cutset bound and are hence, fundamental
outer bounds on the capacity region. Thus, [9], [10] also
characterize up to a factor of Θ(log k) the capacity region
of k-unicast in undirected networks. It has been conjectured
that ﬂow solutions in fact, achieve capacity.
Another setting in which edge-cut bounds can be approximated well is the problem of multiple unicast in directed wireline networks with symmetric demands, i.e. for each source
communicating to its destination at a certain rate, there is an
independent message to be communicated from the destination
back to the source at the same rate. Klein, Plotkin, Rao,
Tardos [14] show under this model that ﬂow solutions achieve
within Θ(log2 k) of the edge-cut bounds. We ask the question:
“Are these edge-cut bounds fundamental outer bounds on the
capacity region?” Surprisingly, the answer turns out to be yes
and the proof of this result is one of the main contributions
of this paper. This completes an approximate characterization
of the capacity region for this class of problems. The key
tool we use in the proof is the Generalized Network Sharing
(GNS) bound that was ﬁrst developed in [15] for directed
wireline networks and was also used subsequently for twounicast linear deterministic networks [16].
Another interesting setting is that of groupcast in directed
wireline networks. There is a group of nodes and each node in
the group has one independent message for each other node in
the group. Naor, Zosin [17] show that the maximum sum-rate
achievable by routing ﬂow for groupcast is at least half the
multicut, a simple edge-cut based outer bound on ﬂow. We
ask the question: “Is the multicut a fundamental upper bound
on the sum-rate?”. We ﬁnd that the answer is no, but that twice
the multicut is indeed a fundamental upper bound. This shows
that routing ﬂow approximately achieves the sum-rate-capacity
for groupcast networks.
When there is some kind of symmetry in the network, either
in the underlying graph (undirected or bidirected networks) or
in the trafﬁc (directed network with symmetric demands or

Abstract—We consider the problem of multiple unicast in
wireline networks. Edge-cut based bounds which are simple
bounds on the rates achievable by routing ﬂow are not in
general, fundamental, i.e. they are not outer bounds on the
capacity region. It has been observed that when the problem has
some kind of symmetry involved, then ﬂows and edge-cut based
bounds are ‘close’, i.e. within a constant or poly-logarithmic
factor of each other. In this paper, we make the observation
that in these very cases, such edge-cut based bounds are actually
‘close’ to fundamental yielding an approximate characterization
of the capacity region for these problems. We demonstrate this
in the case of k-unicast in undirected networks, k-pair unicast in
directed networks with symmetric demands i.e. for every source
communicating to a destination at a certain rate, the destination
communicates an independent message back to the source at the
same rate, and sum-rate of k-groupcast in directed networks, i.e.
a group of nodes, each of which has an independent message for
every other node in the group. We place our work in context of
existing results to suggest a meta-theorem: if there is inherent
symmetry either in the network connectivity or in the trafﬁc
pattern, then edge-cut bounds are near-fundamental and ﬂows
approximately achieve capacity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The central problem of network information theory is to
characterize the capacity region of a general network. Wireline
networks are a special class of such networks where the edges
between vertices are orthogonal and noise-free. In this class of
networks, network coding has the potential to provide signiﬁcant advantages in comparison to ﬂow (i.e. routing strategies)
for multicast problems [1] as well as for multiple unicast
problems [2]. Recent results due to Dougherty, Freiling, Zeger
and Chan, Grant suggest that characterizing the capacity region
of a multiple unicast network is a hard problem [3], [4], [5].
In particular, even coding strategies such as linear codes do
not achieve capacity in general [4].
On the other hand, the literature on hardness of cut problems
typically deal with edge-cut bounds which are conventional
outer bounds on ﬂow. But these bounds are not fundamental
bounds on the capacity region [6], i.e. they can often be beaten
if network coding is allowed. Although edge-cut bounds in directed networks are not fundamental, they are combinatorially
well-represented. They are however, hard to approximate in
general [7], [8].
One class of networks for which edge-cut bounds can be
approximated well are undirected networks. Leighton, Rao [9]

groupcast sum-rate), the following picture seems to emerge.
• (Achievability) Algorithmic Meta-Theorem: Edge-cut
bounds can be well-approximated either by ﬂows [9],
[10], [14], [17], [18] or by other means [11].
• (Converse) Information-Theoretic Meta-Theorem: Edgecut bounds are near-fundamental outer bounds on the
capacity region.
• Combined Meta-Theorem: Flow approximately achieves
capacity.
In a companion paper [19], we use the results of this
paper and achievability results similar to [14] which have
been obtained for the class of polymatroidal networks [18] to
study the capacity regions of multiple unicast with symmetric
demands in different classes of Gaussian networks. The rest
of this paper is organized as follows. We set up notation and
preliminaries in Section II. We brieﬂy state the Generalized
Network Sharing (GNS) bound in Section III. We then discuss
k-unicast undirected networks in Section IV, k-pair unicast
directed symmetric-demand networks in Section V and kgroupcast directed networks in Section VI. We ﬁnally conclude
with a discussion in Section VII.

Deﬁnition. Given a k-unicast directed network N = (G, C)
for source-destination pairs {(si ; di )}i∈I , we say that the nonnegative rate tuple (Ri : i ∈ I) is achievable by routing ﬂow
if there exist for each i ∈ I and each e = (u, v) ∈ E(G), real
numbers fi,e ≥ 0 such that i∈I fi,e ≤ Ce ∀ e ∈ E(G), and

The closure of the set of rate tuples achievable by routing
ﬂow is called the ﬂow region and is denoted by F. Deﬁne the
sum-rate-max-ﬂow by Fsum−rate := sup(Ri :i∈I)∈F i∈I Ri
Deﬁnition. Given a k unicast directed network N = (G, C)
for source-destination pairs {(si ; di )}i∈I , we deﬁne the edgecut outer bound, denoted by Redge−cut , to be the set of all nonnegative tuples (Ri : i ∈ I) that satisfy for every E ⊆ E(G),
the inequality i∈J Ri ≤ e∈E Ce where index i ∈ J ⊆ I
if and only if G \ E has no directed paths from si to di . We
deﬁne the multicut, denoted by Rmulticut , to be the minimum
value of e∈E Ce over all E ⊆ E(G) with the property that
G \ E has no directed paths from si to di for each i ∈ I.

II. P RELIMINARIES
Deﬁnition. A k-unicast directed network N for sourcedestination pairs {(si ; di )}i∈I with |I| = k (for instance,
I := {1, 2, . . . , k}) is a tuple (G, C) where
• G = (V, E) is the underlying directed graph with vertex
set V and edge set E, with si , di ∈ V(G) for i ∈ I,
• C = (Ce : e ∈ E(G)) is the edge-capacity vector, with
Ce ∈ R≥0 ∪ {∞} ∀e ∈ E(G).
For each i ∈ I, si has independent information to be
communicated to di at rate Ri .

Remark 1. Rmulticut may in general be strictly
larger than the tighter bound on Fsum−rate given by
sup(Ri :i∈I)∈Redge−cut i∈I Ri .
While it is clear that F ⊆ Redge−cut and F ⊆ C, the
connection between C and Redge−cut is unclear. It is easy to
show examples where C ⊆ Redge−cut . Thus, simple edge-cut
based outer bounds are not in general, fundamental, i.e. they
are not outer bounds on the capacity region. Likewise it is clear
that Fsum−rate ≤ Rmulticut and Fsum−rate ≤ Csum−rate but
Csum−rate and Rmulticut have no apparent connection. Indeed,
[2] provides a series of k-unicast networks, one for each k
1
with k = 2n with Fsum−rate = Rmulticut = k Csum−rate and
C ⊆ (k − )Redge−cut for any > 0. [20] shows that the gap
between F and Redge−cut can be as large as k − for any
> 0.

Notation. For v ∈ V(G), let In(v) and Out(v) denote the
edges entering into and leaving v respectively.
Deﬁnition. Given a k-unicast directed network N = (G, C)
for source-destination pairs {(si ; di )}i∈I , we say that the nonnegative rate tuple (Ri : i ∈ I) is achievable if for any >
0, there exist positive integers N and T (called block length
and number of epochs respectively), a ﬁnite alphabet A with
|A| ≥ 2 and using notation Hv := Πi∈I:v=si A N T Ri (with
an empty product being the singleton set),

Deﬁnition. Given a directed network N = (G, C) with a set
of 2r distinguished vertices w1 , w2 , . . . , wr , w1 , w2 , . . . , wr ,
if a set of edges E ⊆ E(G) has the property that
G \ E has no directed paths from wi to wj whenever
π(i) ≥ π(j), 1 ≤ i, j ≤ r, for some permutation π :
{1, 2, . . . , r} → {1, 2, . . . , r}, then we say that E is a GNS-cut
for {w1 , w2 , . . . , wr ; w1 , w2 , . . . , wr }.

t ≤ T } and {fdi : i ∈ I}. The closure
achievable rate tuples is called the capacity

Theorem 1. (Generalized Network Sharing (GNS) bound from
Kamath-Tse-Anantharam [15])
Let N = (G, C) be a k-unicast directed network for sourcedestination pairs {si ; di }i∈I . If, for J = {j1 , j2 , . . . , jr } ⊆
I and E ⊆ E(G), we have that E is a GNS-cut for

the global dee ∈ E(G), 1 ≤
of the set of
region and is

{sj1 , sj2 , . . . , sjr ; dj1 , dj2 , . . . , djr }, then for all (Ri : i ∈
I) ∈ C, we have j∈J Rj ≤ e∈E Ce .

Deﬁnition. Given a k-pair unicast directed symmetricdemand network N = (G, C) with source-destination nodes
u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , v1 , v2 , . . . , vk , we deﬁne the GNS-cut outer
bound, denoted by RGNS−cut , to be the set of all non-negative
tuples (Ri : 1 ≤ i ≤ k) that satisfy for every E ⊆ E(G), the
inequality i∈J Ri ≤ e∈E Ce whenever E is a GNS-cut
for {w1 , w2 , . . . , wr ; w1 , w2 , . . . , wr } where
• J ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k}, |J| = r,
• w1 , w2 , . . . , wr , w1 , w2 , . . . , wr are distinct,
• for 1 ≤ j ≤ r, (wj , wj ) = (ui , vi ) or (vi , ui ) for some
i ∈ J.

We skip the proof of Theorem 1 due to lack of space. The
essential idea is contained in [15]. The GNS bound is to the
capacity region what the edge-cut bound is to the commodity
ﬂow region, namely an intuitive outer bound that arises from
simple connectivity properties of the underlying graph of the
network.
IV. k- UNICAST UNDIRECTED NETWORKS
We have skipped the natural counterpart deﬁnitions of
F, C, Redge−cut for undirected networks due to lack of space.
All statements in this section refer to k-unicast undirected
networks.

We deﬁne a weak edge-cut outer bound for this class of
networks.
Deﬁnition. Given a k-pair unicast directed symmetricdemand network N = (G, C) with source-destination nodes
u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , v1 , v2 , . . . , vk , we deﬁne the weak-edge-cut
outer bound, denoted by Rweak−edge−cut , to be the set of all
non-negative tuples (Ri : 1 ≤ i ≤ k) that satisfy for every
E ⊆ E(G), the inequality i∈J Ri ≤ e∈E Ce where index
i ∈ J ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k} if and only if G \ E has no directed
paths from either ui to vi or vi to ui or both.

Deﬁnition. A k-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand
network is a 2k-unicast directed network N with 2k
distinct distinguished nodes (source-destination nodes)
u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , v1 , v2 , . . . , vk with source-destination pairs
{si ; di }i∈I where I = {1, 2, . . . , k} ∪ {−1, −2, . . . , −k}
and for i > 0, si = ui , di = vi , while for
i < 0, si = v−i , di = u−i . The rate tuple (Ri : 1 ≤ i ≤ k)
is deﬁned to be in the capacity region C, ﬂow region F,
edge-cut outer bound Redge−cut for the k-pair unicast directed
symmetric-demand network if the rate tuple (Ri : i ∈ I),
given by Ri = R|i| for i ∈ I, lies in the capacity region, ﬂow
region, edge-cut outer bound respectively of the 2k-unicast
directed network.

All edges have unit capacity

Theorems 6, 7 and 8 together imply that routing ﬂow is
approximately capacity-achieving:

Remark 2. There is no loss of generality in assuming
u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , v1 , v2 , . . . , vk distinct since if they aren’t, we
can add more nodes and inﬁnite capacity edges to make them
distinct while obtaining a network with identical capacity
region.

Connectivity graph and reduced connectivity graph for an instance of a 5-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand network

We conjecture that network coding can improve rates by at
most a constant factor α for k-pair unicast symmetric demand
networks, where α does not depend on k.
Conjecture 10. (Analog of the Li and Li conjecture)
F ⊆ C ⊆ α F.
For the 1-pair unicast symmetric demand network in Fig. 1
with v1 = s1 , v2 = d1 the simple XOR coding scheme shows
that if Conjecture 10 is true, then we must have α ≥ 2. It also
shows that in general, C ⊆ Redge−cut for these networks.
Now, we prove the equivalence between weak-edge-cuts
and GNS-cuts for k-pair unicast directed symmetric-demand
networks, thus proving Theorem 8.
Proof: It is easy to see that the inequality obtained from a
GNS-cut can always be obtained from a weak-edge-cut since
a GNS-cut requires stronger disconnections as compared to
a weak-edge-cut. This gives Rweak−edge−cut ⊆ RGNS−cut .
To show RGNS−cut ⊆ Rweak−edge−cut , we now consider
E ⊆ E(G), and say i ∈ J ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , k} if and only
if G \ E has no directed paths from either ui to vi or
from vi to ui or both. We show that E is a GNS-cut
for {w1 , w2 , . . . , wr ; w1 , w2 , . . . , wr } where the 2r vertices
w1 , w2 , . . . , wr , w1 , w2 , . . . , wr are all distinct and for 1 ≤
j ≤ r, (wj , wj ) = (ui , vi ) or (vi , ui ) for some i ∈ J with
|J| = r. We will prove this for the case J = {1, 2, . . . , k}.
The proof for other choices of J is similar.
Deﬁne the connectivity graph Gc as a directed graph over
2k vertices u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , v1 , v2 , . . . , vk as follows. For every
pair of distinct vertices w and z, there is a directed edge from
w to z in Gc if and only if w has a directed path to z in G \ E.
See Fig. 2(a) for an example. Gc is transitively closed, i.e. for
three distinct vertices w, z, x, if w has an edge to z and z has
an edge to x, then w has an edge to x.
Now, deﬁne the reduced connectivity graph Gr as the
directed acyclic graph with vertices represented by the strongly
connected components of Gc . See Fig. 2(b) for an example.
For each i = 1, 2, . . . , k, we have that ui and vi do not lie in
the same strongly connected component. Note that a directed

acyclic graph has at least one sink vertex, i.e. a vertex with no
outgoing edges. Consider the following algorithm that ﬁlls in
the cells of an initially empty k × 2 table with vertex names
from u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , v1 , v2 , . . . , vk .
(1) Pick any sink vertex in directed acyclic graph Gr .
(2) List the vertices of Gc in the strongly connected component represented by the chosen sink vertex.
(a) Pick a vertex w from the list.
(b) If vertex w has been entered previously in the table,
do nothing. Else, add vertex w in the ﬁrst column
of the lowest row in the table not yet ﬁlled. Add the
destination of vertex w in the second column of the
same row, e.g. if v3 was entered in the ﬁrst column
of the lowest available row, then ﬁll u3 in the second
column.
(c) Remove w from the list and go back to (a) if the list
is still non-empty, else proceed to (3)
(3) Modify graph Gr by deleting the chosen sink vertex. If
this graph has non-zero number of vertices, go to step
(1), else quit.
It is easy to verify that the following properties hold upon
termination of the algorithm. For an example, see Fig. 3.
(i) Each of u1 , u2 , . . . , uk , v1 , v2 , . . . , vk shows up exactly
once in the table.
(ii) Each row of the table is made up of vertices ui and vi
for some i.
(iii) In graph Gc , vertex w obtained from the ﬁrst column of
row i does not have an edge to vertex z obtained from
the second column of row j whenever i ≥ j.
Now, if the j th row of the table consists of ui , vi , we set
π(j) = i and (wi , wi ) = (ui , vi ) or (vi , ui ) depending on
whether the ﬁrst entry in the row is ui or vi . This shows that
E is a GNS-cut for {w1 , w2 , . . . , wk ; w1 , w2 , . . . , wk } with
permutation π. This gives Rweak−edge−cut ⊇ RGNS−cut and
completes the proof.

Theorems 11 and 12 together imply that routing ﬂow is
approximately capacity-achieving for sum-rate:
Corollary 13.
1
Rmulticut ≤ Fsum−rate ≤ Csum−rate ≤ 2 Rmulticut . (10)

We give the proof of Theorem 12.
Proof:
Consider a k-groupcast directed network N with groupnodes v1 , v2 , . . . , vk . Let E be a set of edges such that G \ E
has no directed paths from vi to vj for each (i, j) ∈ I.
Let (R(i,j) : (i, j) ∈ I) ∈ C. Observe that E is a GNScut for source-destination pairs {s(i,j) ; d(i,j) }(i,j)∈I:i>j . Theorem 1 gives (i,j)∈I:i>j R(i,j) ≤ e∈E Ce . Similarly, we
can get (i,j)∈I:i<j R(i,j) ≤ e∈E Ce . Adding, we obtain
(i,j)∈I R(i,j) ≤ 2
e∈E Ce , which completes the proof.
Remark 4. For the groupcast network in Fig. 1, the simple
XOR coding scheme shows that the factor 2 in the statement
of Theorem 12 cannot be improved upon.
VII. D ISCUSSION
It is intriguing that the kinds of symmetry that lead to ﬂow edge-cut closeness results also lead to the near-fundamentality
of such edge-cuts. It would be interesting to ﬁnd a deeper
explanation of this phenomenon.
