Abstract—The block dual-diagonal (BDD) parity structure is
widely adopted in many practical irregular quasi-cyclic (QC) lowdensity parity-check (LDPC) codes. These QC LDPC codes have
good error-correcting performance in waterfall region but usually
show relatively high error ﬂoors in low error rate region. In this
paper, by using multi-weight circulants, a new BDD structure
is proposed for the parity part of irregular QC LDPC codes to
lower error ﬂoors and support efﬁcient encoding. Since the parity
part of parity-check matrices has ﬂexible degree distribution
with the aid of multi-weight circulants, QC LDPC codes with
the proposed BDD structure can have large minimum Hamming
distance compared to those with the conventional BDD structure,
especially, in the low-rate case. Simulation results show that QC
LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure have lower error
ﬂoor than those with the conventional BDD structure.

Hamming distance for ﬁnite-length case and good threshold
for asymptotic case [1].
In this paper, a new BDD structure is proposed for irregular
QC LDPC codes to lower error ﬂoors. By adopting multiweight circulants, the parity part of parity-check matrices
can have ﬂexible degree distribution while maintaining BDD
structure and supporting the efﬁcient encoding. Therefore, by
properly adjusting the fraction of degree-2 variable nodes, QC
LDPC codes can have large minimum Hamming distance and
good threshold. The proposed BDD structure improves the
error-correcting performance, especially, in the case of lowrate QC LDPC codes. QC LDPC codes with the proposed
BDD structure which do not include harmful stopping sets
or trapping sets are generated and it is shown via numerical
analysis that they have lower error ﬂoor than QC LDPC codes
with the conventional BDD structure.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes generally
outperform regular LDPC codes in waterfall region and have
a good threshold [1]. However, those LDPC codes of ﬁnite
length are prone to suffer from high error ﬂoors [2] in low
error rate region. The error ﬂoor phenomenon is closely related to minimum Hamming distance and some combinatorial
structures such as stopping sets [3] and trapping sets [2]. In
designing LDPC codes for low error ﬂoors, small minimum
Hamming distance and small-size stopping sets or trapping
sets should be avoided. Most well-known irregular LDPC
codes have many degree-2 variable nodes [1], [4], [5] but it
is known that the minimum Hamming distance of a ﬁnitelength irregular LDPC code tends to get smaller as it has more
degree-2 variable nodes [6], [7].
Recently, irregular quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with the
block dual-diagonal (BDD) parity structure are widely adopted
in many standards such as IEEE 802.16e [4] and 802.11n [5]
because the BDD structure enables the efﬁcient encoding [8],
[9] and leads to good error-correcting performance especially
in waterfall region. The BDD structure consists of mostly
degree-2 variable nodes and therefore, if the rate of QC
LDPC codes with the BDD structure is given, the fraction of
degree-2 variable nodes in the parity-check matrices cannot be
below a certain value. This restriction may prevent QC LDPC
codes from having good degree distributions. Especially, lowrate QC LDPC codes with the BDD structure have so many
degree-2 variable nodes that they cannot have large minimum

where a circulant Hj,l is deﬁned as a matrix whose each row
is a cyclic shift of the row above it. Let M × N be the size
of H. Then M = Jz, N = Lz, and the code design rate
R = 1 − M/N = 1 − J/L. The Tanner graph of C is a
bipartite graph which has H as its incidence matrix.
The weight of a circulant Hj,l is deﬁned as the number of

A circulant of weight 1 is called circulant permutation matrix.
A multi-weight circulant is deﬁned as a circulant of weight
larger than 1. A circulant is entirely described by the positions
of nonzero elements in the ﬁrst column. Let the index of the ith element in the ﬁrst column be i − 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ z. The shift
value(s) of a circulant is deﬁned as the index (indices) of the
nonzero element(s) in the ﬁrst column. Note that a shift value

n2 equals to the number of weight-2 circulants in Hp or the
number of binomials in Hp (x). Since n2 is not a ﬁxed number,
it is usually determined by the desired degree distribution. In
each weight-2 circulant, one has zero shift value and the other
has a nonzero shift value from {1, 2, . . . , z −1}. Let ri and si ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n2 , denote the row index (equal to the column
index) and the nonzero shift value of the i-th binomial in
Hp (x), respectively. Note that 0 ≤ ri ≤ J −1, 1 ≤ si ≤ z −1,
and r1 < r2 < · · · < rn2 . Deﬁne S as the multiset of all
nonzero shift values in Hp , that is, S = {si |i = 1, . . . , n2 }.
Note that an element is allowed to appear more than once in
a multiset.
Unlike the conventional BDD structure, the proposed BDD
structure provides the ﬂexibility in controlling the fraction of
degree-2 and degree-3 variable nodes by adjusting n2 . Note
that for given J and z, the fraction of degree-2 variable
nodes for the rate-R QC LDPC codes with the proposed
BDD structure is (1 − R)(1 − n2 /J) if Hm does not have
degree-2 variable nodes. Even though R is small, the fraction
of degree-2 variable nodes can be decreased by increasing
n2 . Thus QC LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure
have more ﬂexibility in taking any good degree distribution,
which is a desirable property for the irregular QC LDPC codes
because good irregular QC LDPC codes generally have many
degree-3 variable nodes as well as degree-2 variable nodes as
seen in optimal degree distributions [1] and many standards
[4], [5], [12]. Also, QC LDPC codes with the proposed
BDD structure can have larger minimum Hamming distance
and better threshold than those with the conventional BDD
structure.

takes the value from 0 to z − 1 and a multi-weight circulant
has multiple shift values.
QC LDPC codes can be fully represented by binary polynomials as shown in [10]. This polynomial representation is
based on the isomorphism between z ×z binary circulants and
the polynomial ring F2 [x]/(xz + 1). The polynomial paritycheck matrix H(x) of C is deﬁned as
⎤
⎡
h0,0 (x)
h0,1 (x)
···
h0,L−1 (x)
⎢ h1,0 (x)
h1,1 (x)

z−1

where hj,l (x) = i=0 hj,l,i xi ∈ F2 [x]/(xz + 1) and hj,l,i is
the element with the index i in the ﬁrst column of Hj,l . We can
see that the number of terms in hj,l (x) is equal to wt(Hj,l )
and the degrees of all terms in hj,l (x) are equivalent to the
shift values of Hj,l .
QC LDPC codes are also described as protograph-based
LDPC codes [11] because they can be regarded as the lifted
ones from the protographs using cyclic permutations. The
incidence matrix of the protograph P of C is represented as
P = [pj,l ], where pj,l = wt(Hj,l ). By abuse of notation, P
will represent the bipartite graph itself or its incidence matrix
based on their equivalence. Let z be called the lift size of C.
A multi-weight circulant Hj,l is represented as parallel edges
between the horizontal node j and the vertical node l in the
protograph and each edge in the protograph has a shift value
so that the edge is lifted by using the cyclic permutation with
the shift value to generate C.
For convenience, each matrix is divided into the message part and the parity part: H = [ Hm | Hp ], H(x) =
[ Hm (x) | Hp (x) ], and P = [ Pm | Pp ]. Note that the size
of Hm and Hp is M × (N − M ) and M × M , respectively,
and the size of Hm (x) and Pm is J × (L − J) and the size
of Hp (x) and Pp is J × J. Accordingly, a codeword of C is
split into the message part m and the parity part p.

The proposed BDD structure can provide the efﬁcient
encoding by properly determining the nonzero shift values
of weight-2 circulants. Assume that n2 is already determined
according to the desired degree distribution, and J and z are
also given. S is ﬁrstly determined for the efﬁcient encoding
in this section and then ri , i = 1, . . . , n2 and the ordering of
the elements in S are also determined in Section IV.
Recall the efﬁcient encoding of LDPC codes in [8]. A
parity-check matrix H can be partitioned into

and
guarantees that cycles of length 4 do not occur in each weight2 circulant.

where B, T, D, and E form the parity part, T is a lowertriangular matrix, and D is a square matrix. Denote the parity
part of a codeword by p = [ p1 p2 ], where p1 corresponds
to B and D and p2 corresponds to T and E. Then, p1 and
p2 are obtained as

From Theorems 1 and 2, we can clearly determine S
supporting the efﬁcient encoding and avoid cycles of length 4
in each weight-2 circulant for n2 = J and almost all z. Note
that Theorems 1 and 2 hold regardless of ri , i = 1, . . . , J
and in addition, it is not necessary to know every si . For the
efﬁcient encoding, it is only required to determine the multiset
S from which each si will be taken in Section IV.
In the case of n2 < J, we can similarly have
φ(x) = (1 + xs1 )(1 + xs2 ) · · · (1 + xsn2 ) + 1 regardless
of ri , i = 1, . . . , n2 . Hence, {20 mod z, 20 mod z, 21
mod z, 22 mod z, . . . , 2n2 −2 mod z} or the splitted version
of {20 , 20 , 21 , 22 , . . . , 2l−2 } for an integer l < n2 as in
Theorems 1 and 2 can be used as S to support the efﬁcient
encoding and avoid cycles of length 4.

where φ := ET−1 B + D.
Now, consider the efﬁcient encoding of QC LDPC codes
with the proposed BDD structure. First, assume that n2 = J,
which means every diagonal element in Pp is 2. The case of
other value of n2 can be treated similarly as this case. Let
H(x) be represented by a partitioned polynomial parity-check
matrix as
A(x) B(x) T(x)

H(x) =
C(x) D(x) E(x)

IV. S EARCH FOR G OOD QC LDPC C ODES W ITH THE
P ROPOSED BDD S TRUCTURE
It is experimentally shown in [9] that the girth of the
subgraph consisting of only variable nodes of low degree
(i.e., degrees 2 and 3) in H is desired to be large for good
error-correcting performance in the error ﬂoor region. This
observation agrees with the concept of the approximate cycle
extrinsic message degree (ACE) algorithm [13] that are used to
avoid harmful stopping sets and trapping sets. Accordingly, for
the given S in Theorem 1 or 2, we aim to ﬁnd ri , i = 1, . . . , n2
and the ordering of the elements in S for sufﬁciently large girth
of Hp .
The girth of a QC LDPC code is clearly determined by
the structure of the protograph, lift size, and all shift values
assigned to edges. However, we can derive an upper bound on
the girth of QC LDPC codes lifted from a given protograph
without considering the lift size and shift values based on the
concept of inevitable cycles.

We can easily derive the inverse of T(x) as in the top of
this page. Finally, φ(x) is derived as
φ(x) = E(x)T−1 (x)B(x) + D(x)
= (1 + xs1 )(1 + xs2 ) · · · (1 + xsJ ) + 1.
Therefore, φ is a z ×z circulant of weight equal to the number
of terms in φ(x).
For the efﬁcient encoding, the existence of φ−1 should
be guaranteed. A simple way for this is making φ be a
circulant permutation matrix, that is, φ(x) = xk for some
0 ≤ k ≤ z − 1, by ﬁnding proper si , i = 1, 2, . . . , J. Then we
have φ−1 (x) = x−k mod z and p1 and p2 can be efﬁciently
encoded. We can ﬁnd such a S from Theorems 1 and 2 whose
proofs are omitted in this paper. Note that when z is even, si
should not be z/2 to avoid cycles of length 4 inside the i-th
weight-2 circulant of Hp [10].

Deﬁnition 1 ([14], [15]): An inevitable cycle induced by
a protograph is deﬁned as the shortest one of the cycles
which should appear in the QC LDPC codes lifted from the
protograph regardless of the lift size and shift values.

Theorem 1: Assume that z = 2k for all integers
k < J. Then S = {20 mod z, 20 mod z, 21 mod z, 22

in S which maximizes the girth of Hp can be obtained via
extensive search. This full search is a time-consuming job but
for moderate n2 , it is generally manageable because n2 is not
large in most cases.
For given J, L, z, Hp , and degree distributions in H, Hm
should be carefully constructed for QC LDPC codes to have
low error ﬂoors. For this, the submatrix of H consisting of
the columns of low weight should have a sufﬁciently large
girth [9], [13] and thus the construction algorithm in [9],
which will be called the stepwise greedy girth-maximizing
(SGGM) algorithm in this paper, is used for constructing Hm .
It is assumed that Hm only consists of circulant permutation
matrices and zero matrices and its column weights are larger
than or equal to 3.

Subsection II-B. Filled circles and squares represent vertical and horizontal

The protograph of the proposed BDD structure is relatively
simple as shown in Fig. 1.
Deﬁnition 2 ([16]): A (x1 , x2 ; y)-dumbbell graph, denoted
by D(x1 , x2 ; y), is a connected graph consisting of two edgedisjoint cycles X1 and X2 of the numbers of edges x1 ≥ 1
and x2 ≥ 1, respectively, that are connected by a path Y of
the number of edges y ≥ 0.

V. S IMULATION R ESULTS
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed BDD structure,
the error-correcting performance of QC LDPC codes with
the proposed BDD structure is compared with that with the
conventional BDD structure. All simulations are performed
using the belief propagation (BP) decoding under the binary
AWGN channel and the maximum number of iterations is set
to 100.
Four QC LDPC codes with J = 30, L = 45, and z =
45 are generated. The ﬁrst one, denoted by ‘Prop1,’ has the
proposed BDD structure as the parity part and its message
part is constructed from the SGGM algorithm. The second
one, denoted by ‘Conv1,’ has the conventional BDD structure
as the parity part and its message part is also constructed from
the SGGM algorithm. The third one, denoted by ‘Prop2,’ has
the proposed BDD structure as the parity part and is selected
among 200 QC LDPC codes with sufﬁciently large girth whose
parity-check matrices have the message parts randomly lifted
from a randomly constructed protograph. The last one, denoted
by ‘Conv2,’ is the counterpart to ‘Prop2.’ These codes have
the parameters N = 2025 and R = 1/3 and it is noted that
the rate-1/3 QC LDPC codes in ETSI DVB-S2 standards [12]
also have 30 × 45 protographs.
The degree distributions of four QC LDPC codes are shown
in Table I. ‘Conv1’ and ‘Conv2’ has almost the same degree
distribution as the rate-1/3 QC LDPC codes in ETSI DVB-S2
standards. We can see that there are too many variable nodes
of degree 2 in ‘Conv1’ and ‘Conv2’ due to the conventional
BDD structure. These QC LDPC codes have 1.004 as the

Lemma 1 ([16]): D(x1 , x2 ; y) induces the inevitable cycles
of length 2(x1 + x2 ) + 4y.
In the protograph of the proposed BDD structure, we can
ﬁnd n2 dumbbell graphs connected back to back to form a
chain. Let yi , i = 1, . . . , n2 − 1, denote the number of 1’s
along with the shortest path between the i-th and (i + 1)-th
2’s in Pp and yn2 denote the one between n2 -th and the ﬁrst
2’s. Then, we have yi = 2(ri+1 − ri ) − 1 for i = 1, . . . , n2 − 1
and yn2 = 2(J + r1 − rn2 ) − 1. The length of the inevitable
cycles induced by Pp can be obtained in the next theorem.
Theorem 3: The length of the inevitable cycles induced by
Pp is mini:1≤i≤n2 {8 + 4yi }.
Proof: In Pp , there are n2 dumbbell graphs, that is,
D(2, 2; yi ) for i = 1, . . . , n2 . Based on the Deﬁnition 1,
the inevitable cycles induced by Pp are determined only by
D(2, 2; yi ) with the smallest yi . From Lemma 1, the length of
the inevitable cycles is mini:1≤i≤n2 {8 + 4yi }.
According to Theorem 3, yi ’s, i = 1, . . . , n2 , are desired to
have as close values as possible for avoiding short inevitable
cycles in Hp . Although the length of the inevitable cycles
induced by Pp is an upper bound on the girth of Hp , not the
girth itself, these yi ’s are adequate for achieving sufﬁciently
large girth. In addition, since a cycle in Hp is generated by
a walk traversing two or more double edges in Pp [15], a
small yi is more likely to generate short cycles. For yi ’s
determined as equally as possible, the ordering of the elements

threshold under the AWGN channel which is calculated from
[17]. Note that the girths of ‘Conv1’ and ‘Conv2’ are 8 and
6, respectively.
The degree distribution in Table I is used for the proposed
BDD cases ‘Prop1’ and ‘Prop2’ with n2 = 9. For fair
comparison, the number of edges in the parity-check matrices
of ‘Prop1’ and ‘Prop2’ is not larger than that of ‘Conv1’ and
‘Conv2.’ The threshold of these QC LDPC codes is 1.225
which is much larger than that of ‘Conv1’ and ‘Conv2.’ Note
that the girths of ‘Prop1’ and ‘Prop2’ are 8 and 6, respectively.
The frame error rate (FER) and bit error rate (BER) of
the above four QC LDPC codes are shown in Fig. 2. In
both FER and BER, ‘Prop1’ and ‘Prop2’ show better errorcorrecting performance than ‘Conv1’ and ‘Conv2’ in the error
ﬂoor region, respectively.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a new BDD structure is proposed for irregular
QC LDPC codes to achieve low error ﬂoors. By adopting
weight-2 circulants, the parity part of parity-check matrices
can have ﬂexible degree distribution, which can results in large
minimum Hamming distance unlike the case of the conventional BDD structure. The proposed BDD structure can support
the efﬁcient encoding of QC LDPC codes by determining
the set of shift values appropriately. We search for good QC
LDPC codes with the proposed BDD structure by determining
the ordering of nonzero shift values in the proposed BDD
structure and properly locating weight-2 circulants. It is shown
via numerical analysis that QC LDPC codes with the proposed
BDD structure have good error-correcting performance in the
error ﬂoor region compared to those with the conventional
BDD structure.
