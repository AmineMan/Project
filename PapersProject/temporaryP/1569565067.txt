Abstract—We derive a new achievable sum rate for the
symmetric Gaussian K-user interference channel. This sum rate
is shown to be within a constant gap of the outer bound on the
sum capacity of this channel for all values of interference level
outside some outage set. The result is established through the use
of lattice interference alignment. A new lattice-based extension
to the Han-Kobayshi scheme is also introduced.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Handling interference efﬁciently is a major challenge in
multi-user wireless communication. Recently, it has become
clear that this challenge can often be overcome via interference alignment [1], [2]. However, many schemes, such as
the Cadambe-Jafar framework [2] and ergodic interference
alignment [3], require many independent channel realizations
to achieve near-perfect alignment. For static channels, it is
known that similar gains are possible but existing schemes,
such as real interference alignment [4], only apply to the very
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.
One promising direction is the use of lattice codes, as
they can enable alignment on the signal scale. Speciﬁcally,
by taking advantage of the fact that the sum of lattice codewords is itself a lattice codeword, a receiver can treat several
users as one effective user, thereby reducing the number of
effective interferers. For instance, this approach has been
used to characterize the approximate capacity of the manyto-one interference channel [5]. The fully connected case
presents additional challenges, many of which are captured
by the special case of symmetric channels. In this paper, we
derive a new achievable rate region for the symmetric K-user
interference channel. Our schemes rely on the compute-andforward framework [6], which can efﬁciently communicate
integer combinations of codewords by exploiting the linear
mixing provided by the channel. At a high level, implementing
interference alignment with compute-and-forward boils down
to recovering just two equations per receiver. That is, if the
transmitted codewords are denoted by xm , then a receiver can
recover the kth codeword by ﬁrst decoding the equations
a11 xk + a12

where a11 , a12 , a21 , and a22 are integer-valued coefﬁcients.
If the vectors a1 = [a11 a12 ]T and a2 = [a21 a22 ]T are
linearly independent, then the receiver can solve for its desired
codeword xk . This technique performs well strating in the
moderate SNR regime (see Figure 1), and sufﬁces to achieve
rates within a constant gap of the symmetric capacity of the
symmetric K-user interference channel.
II. A PPROXIMATE S UM C APACITY
We consider the symmetric K-user Gaussian interference
channel. This channel consists of K transmitter-receiver pairs
that wish to simultaneously communicate across a shared
channel over n time slots, where the channel gains are constant
over all n channel uses. We assume a real-valued channel
model throughout. Each transmitter has a message wk drawn
independently and uniformly over {1, 2, . . . , 2nRSYM }, and is
equipped with an encoder, Ek : {1, 2, . . . , 2nRSYM } → Rn , that
maps its message into a length-n channel input xk = Ek (wk ).
The channel inputs satisfy the power constraint xk 2 ≤
nSNR, where SNR > 0 is the signal-to-noise ratio. The
channel output at each receiver is a noisy linear combination
of its desired signal and the sum of the interfering terms, of
the form
yk = xk + g

xm + zk ,

(1)

m=k

where g > 0 parametrizes the interference strength and zk
is an i.i.d. Gaussian vector with mean 0 and variance 1. We
deﬁne the interference-to-noise ratio to be INR g 2 SNR and
the interference level to be1
α

log(INR)
.
log(SNR)

Each receiver is equipped with a decoder, Dk : Rn →
{1, 2, . . . , 2nRSYM }, that produces an estimate wk = Dk (yk ) of
ˆ
its desired message wk . A symmetric rate RSYM is achievable
if, for any ǫ > 0 and n large enough, there exist encoders and
decoders that can attain probability of error at most ǫ. The
symmetric capacity CSYM is the supremum of all achievable
symmetric rates.
1 Note that our deﬁnition of INR ignores the fact that there are K − 1
interferers observed at each receiver.

Remark 1: Due to the symmetry of the channel, the symmetric capacity is equal to the sum capacity, normalized by
the number of users.
Much of the previous work on this channel focused on
ﬁnding the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) [4], [7] and generalized
DoF [8] it offers. The DoF is deﬁned as the ratio between the
symmetric-capacity of the channel and the single-user AWGN
channel capacity, in the limit of SNR → ∞. Surprisingly,
the DoF characterization is everywhere discontinuous [7] with
respect to g. This presents an obstacle towards a clean capacity
approximation at ﬁnite SNR.
To overcome this difﬁculty, our approximations allow for
the possibility of an outage set. Speciﬁcally, in the regime
around α = 1, our capacity results take the following shape:
for any constant c > 0, the capacity is approximated within
c bits over the entire range of SNR, and all channel gains g,
except for a set of Lebesgue measure µ(c) which vanishes
rapidly with c. This type of capacity approximation is also
used in [9] and seems to arise from the capacity region itself,
not just the lower bound. That is, it appears that the capacity
may in fact simultaneously vary rapidly with the ﬁne scale
of the channel gains (e.g., the distance to an appropriately
scaled integer) and slowly on the coarse scale (e.g., relative
interference strength). In the high SNR limit, this behavior
shows up as a discontinuity on the rationals but, at reasonable
SNRs, our achievable scheme shows that this variation is in
fact fairly smooth. The theorem below captures our capacity
approximations in a simple form.
Theorem 1: The symmetric capacity of the symmetric
Gaussian K-user interference channel can be lower and upper
bounded as follows:2

The outer bounds in Theorem 1 are based on the outer
bounds from [10] for the two-user interference channel. These
bounds for the K-user interference channel since, from the
perspective of each receiver, adding more interferers cannot
increase its own capacity.
In the noisy interference regime, the inner bound is obtained simply by treating interference as noise. Conversely,
in the very strong interference regime, the inner bound can
be obtained by decoding and removing the interference, as
ﬁrst shown in [11]. Our main contributions are the inner
bounds for the strong, moderately weak and weak interference
regimes. These bounds rely on two different lattice-based
interference alignment schemes whose achievable rates are
stated in Theorems 2 and 3. Note that the rates are expressed in
terms of integer least-squares optimization problems. To obtain
our closed-form inner bounds in these regimes, we make use
of new bounds and techniques based on compute-and-forward
that are developed in [12]. Due to space limitations, proofs are
omitted and the reader is referred to [13] for the full details.
Figure 1 shows the achievable rates given by Theorems 2
and 3 for the three-user symmetric interference channel for
several values of SNR. The rates plotted in the ﬁgure were
found numerically by solving the corresponding integer leastsquares problems. For reference, we have also plotted the
upper bounds of [10] and the rate achievable by time division.
In the sequel we introduce the coding schemes used for
deriving Theorems 2 and 3.

We employ the nested lattice framework originally proposed
in [14]. A lattice Λ is a discrete subgroup of Rn which is
closed under reﬂection and real addition. Formally, for any
t1 , t2 ∈ Λ, we have that −t1 , −t2 ∈ Λ and t1 + t2 ∈ Λ.
We denote the nearest neighbor quantizer associated with
the lattice Λ by QΛ (·) and the Voronoi region by V. The
modulo operation returns the quantization error w.r.t. the
lattice, [x] mod Λ = x − QΛ (x).
A lattice Λ is said to be nested in Λ1 if Λ ⊆ Λ1 . Our
schemes utilizes a chain of K + 1 nested lattices satisfying
Λ ⊆ ΛK ⊆ · · · ⊆ Λ1 . From these lattices, we construct K
codebooks, one for each user. Speciﬁcally, user k is allocated
the codebook Lk = Λθ(k) ∩ V, where V is the Voronoi region
of Λ and the function θ(k) : {1, . . . , K} → {1, . . . , K} maps
between users and lattices. The rate of each codebook Lk is
Rk = 1/n log |Λθ(k) ∩ V|.

Fig. 1. Upper and lower bounds on the sum capacity of a 3-user symmetric Gaussian interference channel with respect to the cross-gain g. The upper bound
(red line) is that of [10] and the lower bound (black line) is the maximum of the achievable rates from Theorems 2 and 3, which were computed numerically,
and the achievable rate for treating interference as noise. The lower bounds from Theorem 1 are not plotted in this ﬁgure. For reference, we have also plotted
the rate achievable via time-division (dotted blue line).

User k encodes its message onto a lattice point from its
codebook, tk ∈ Lk . Each user also has a random3 dither vector
dk which is generated independently and uniformly over V.
These dithers are made available to the decoder. The signal
transmitted by user k is xk = [tk − dk ] mod Λ.
B. Effective multiple-access channel
A channel that often arises in the context of lattice interference alignment is a K-user Gaussian multiple-access channel
(MAC) with integer-valued ratios between some of the channel
coefﬁcients. Speciﬁcally, the output of such a channel can be
written as
gℓ
ℓ=1

bm xm , ℓ = 1, . . . , L.

xeff,ℓ
m∈Kℓ

The channel (2) may describe the signal seen by a receiver
in an interference network, perhaps after appropriate precoding
at the transmitters. In such networks, each receiver is only
interested in the messages from some of the users while
the others act as interferers. Hence, it is beneﬁcial to align
several interfering users into one effective interferer, by taking
advantage of the fact that the sum of lattice codewords is itself
a lattice codeword.
Deﬁnition 1 (Effective users): For the MAC speciﬁed
by (2), we deﬁne L effective users

bm xm

+ z,

(2)

m∈Kℓ

where K1 , . . . , KL are disjoint subsets of {1, . . . , K}. We
assume that the bm ∈ Z are non-zero integers, which opens
up the possibility of lattice alignment.
3 It

can be shown that these random dithers can be replaced with deterministic ones, meaning that no common randomness is required.

Deﬁnition 3 (Effective lattice points): Let tm be the lattice
point transmitted by user m. We deﬁne the effective lattice
point corresponding to effective user ℓ as
teff,ℓ =

bm tm mod Λ.
m∈Kℓ

Let θeff (ℓ) = minm∈Kℓ θ(m) be the index of the densest lattice
contributing to teff,ℓ . Since all lattices are nested, it follows that
teff,ℓ ∈ Λθeff (ℓ) .
When lattice interference alignment schemes are designed
properly, the message intended for the receiver is mapped into
a unique effective user, while multiple interfering users are
folded into a smaller number of effective users. In this case, it
sufﬁces for the receiver to decode only the L effective lattice
points corresponding to the effective users, rather than the K
lattice points transmitted by all users. In our considerations,
the effective lattice points are recovered by ﬁrst decoding
L
L lattice equations of the type v =
ℓ=1 aℓ teff,ℓ mod Λ
with linearly independent coefﬁcient vectors, and then solving
for teff,1 , . . . , teff,L . We use the compute-and-forward framework [6] for decoding the lattice equations.

SCHEMES

In this section, we use the compute-and-forward framework
in order obtain two new achievable symmetric rate-regions.
We develop two coding schemes. The ﬁrst sufﬁces to approximate the symmetric capacity for the very strong, strong and
noisy interference regimes. The second scheme is a latticebased variant of the well-known Han-Kobayashi scheme [15],
which approximately achieves the symmetric capacity in the
moderately weak and weak interference regimes.

4

First scheme - A single-layer lattice code: This scheme uses a
pair of nested lattices Λ ⊆ Λ1 to construct the codebook L =
Λ1 ∩ Λ of rate RSYM . All users encode their messages using
this codebook. Since all interferers arrive at the kth transmitter
with the same gain, they will be aligned into one effective
lattice point. Thus, the K-user MAC seen by the kth receiver
becomes an effective two-user MAC of the form deﬁned in
Section III-B
yk = xeff,k1 + gxeff,k2 + zk ,

(5)

where xeff,k1 = xk , xeff,k2 =
m=k xm are the effective
users, b2
= 1, b2
= K − 1 are the effective users’
eff,k1
eff,k2
weights and g = [1 g]T is the vector of channel gains.
The next theorem gives an achievable rate region for the Kuser interference channel when each receiver jointly decodes
both the effective user xeff,k1 which carries the desired information, and the effective user xeff,k2 which carries the sum
of interfering codewords. The theorem relies on decoding two
independent linear combinations of the effective lattice points.
This is in contrast to the successive decoding technique used
in [11], where ﬁrst the interference is decoded and removed,
and only then the desired lattice point is decoded.
Theorem 2: Let Rcomp,1 ≥ Rcomp,2 be the optimal computation rates for the effective MAC (5) induced by the
symmetric K-user interference channel (1). Any symmetric
rate RSYM < Rcomp,2 is achievable for the symmetric K-user
interference channel (1).
For the two-user case, it is known that in the weak and
moderately weak interference regimes each receiver should
decode only part of the message transmitted by the other
user [10]. A natural extension of this Han-Kobayashi [15]
approach to the K-user case is for each receiver to decode
linear combinations that only include parts of the interfering
messages. This is enabled by using a superposition of two
lattice codewords at each transmitter. See Figure 2 for an
illustration.
Second scheme - Lattice Han-Kobayashi: This scheme employs a chain of nested lattices Λ ⊆ Λ2 ⊆ Λ1 to construct
two codebooks L1 and L2 with rates R1 and R2 , respectively.
Each user k splits its message wk into two messages, a public
message wk1 that is mapped into codebook L1 and a private
message wk2 that is mapped into codebook L2 . It is convenient
to treat each user k as two virtual users with codewords xk1
and xk2 that carry messages wk1 and wk2 , respectively. User
k transmits a superposition of its virtual users’ codewords,
xk =

1 − γ 2 xk1 + γxk2 ,

for γ ∈ [0, 1). The signal seen by the kth receiver is

The receiver aims to decode the effective codewords xeff,k1 ,
xeff,k2 and xeff,k3 while treating the fourth effective codeword xeff,k4 as noise. This is done by using the computeand-forward framework to decode three independent linear
combinations of xeff,k1 , xeff,k2 and xeff,k3 in which xeff,k4
does not participate. It can be shown [13] that for this aim
the effective channel (7) is equivalent to the effective threeuser MAC

As in the two-user interference channel, the value of γ
should be optimized such as to maximize the achievable
rates for decoding the effective users xeff,k1 and xeff,k2 from
the effective three-user MAC. We follow the approach taken
in [10] and choose γ 2 = 1/(g 2 SNR). With this choice, we
can obtain the following theorem (see [13]).
