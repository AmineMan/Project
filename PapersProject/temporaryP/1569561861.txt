Abstract—We determine the capacity of the classical compound
quantum wiretapper channel with channel state information
at the transmitter. Moreover we derive a lower bound on the
capacity of this channel without channel state information and
determine the capacity of the classical quantum compound
wiretap channel with channel state information at the transmitter.

the capacity without CSI. In this channel model the wiretapper
uses classical quantum channels. In Section IV we derive the
capacity of the classical quantum compound wiretap channel
with CSI. In this model both the receiver and the wiretapper
use classical quantum channels, and the set of the states can
be both ﬁnite or inﬁnite.

The compound channel models transmission over a channel
that may take a number of states, its capacity was determined
by [5]. A compound channel with an eavesdropper is called a
compound wiretap channel. It is deﬁned as a family of pairs
of channels {(Wt , Vt ) : t = 1, · · · , T } with common input
alphabet and possibly different output alphabets, connecting a
sender with two receivers, one legal and one wiretapper, where
t is called a state of the channel pair (Wt , Vt ). The legitimate
receiver accesses the output of the ﬁrst channel Wt in the pair
(Wt , Vt ), and the wiretapper observes the output of the second
part Vt in the pair (Wt , Vt ), respectively, when a state t governs
the channel. A code for the channel conveys information to the
legal receiver such that the wiretapper knows nothing about the
transmitted information. This is a generalization of Wyner’s
wiretap channel [14] to the case of multiple channel states.
We will be dealing with two communication scenarios. In
the ﬁrst one only the transmitter is informed about the index
t (channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter), while in
the second, the legitimate users have no information about that
index at all (no CSI). The compound wiretap channels were
recently introduced in [8]. An upper bound on the capacity
under the condition that the average error goes to zero and the
sender has no knowledge about CSI is obtained. The result of
[8] was improved in [4] by using the stronger condition that
the maximal error should go to zero. Furthermore, the capacity
for the case with CSI was derived.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present
some known results for classical compound wiretap channel.
In Section III we derive the capacity of the classical compound
quantum wiretap channel with CSI and give a lower bound of

Let A, B, and C be ﬁnite sets, P (A), P (B), and P (C)
be the sets of probability distributions on A, B, and C,
respectively. Let θ := {1, · · · , T }. For every t ∈ θ let Wt be a
channel A → P (B) and Vt be a channel A → P (C). We call
(Vt , Wt )t∈θ a compound wiretap channel. Wtn and Vtn stand
for the n-th memoryless extensions of stochastic matrices Wt
and Vt . Here the ﬁrst family represents the communication link
to the legitimate receiver while the output of the latter is under
control of the wiretapper. An (n, Jn ) code for the compound
wiretap channel (Vt , Wt )t∈θ consists of stochastic encoders

Theorem 1: The capacity of the classical compound quantum wiretap channel (Wt , Vt )t∈θ in the case with CSI at the
transmitter CS,CSI is given by

Since here only the error of the legitimate receiver is analyzed,
for the result above just the channels Vt , but not those of
the wiretapper, are regarded. It was shown in [4] that by (1),
the largest achievable rate, called capacity, of the compound
wiretap channel with CSI at the transmitter CS,CSI , is given
by

where Bt are the resulting random variables at the output of

the output of wiretap channels.
Proof: Let pt , X (t) , and Dj be deﬁned like in classical
case. Then (1) still holds since the sender transmits through
a classical channel to the legitimate receiver. We abbreviate
X := {X (t) : t ∈ θ}. (Analogously, in the case without CSI,
let p , X n , and Dj be deﬁned like in classical case, then (3)
still holds.)

where Bt are the resulting random states at the output of legal

Proof: Our idea is to send the information in two parts,
ﬁrstly, we send the state information with ﬁnite blocks of ﬁnite
bits with a code C1 to the receiver, and then, depending on t,
(t)
we send the message with a code C2 in the second part. We
don’t require that the ﬁrst part should be secure against the
wiretapper, since we assume that the wiretapper already has
full knowledge of the CSI. By ignoring the security against the
wiretapper, we have only to consider the compound channel
(Wt )t∈θ . Let W = (Wt )t be an arbitrary compound classicalquantum-channel. Then by [3], for each λ ∈ (0, 1) the λcapacity C(W, λ) equals

t ∈ θ such that C(Vt , Wt ) = mint∈θ C(Vt , Wt ). It is wellknown, in information theory, that even in the case without
wiretapper (we have only one classical channel Wt ), the
capacity cannot exceed I(J; Bt ) + ξ for any constant ξ > 0.
Thus, the capacity of a quantum wiretap channel (Wt , Vt )
cannot be greater than

If mint maxp χ(p, Wt ) > 0, then for any required upper bound

code of sufﬁciently large but constant length such that with the
probability at least 1− λ the legal receiver decodes correctly. In

case mint maxp χ(p, Wt ) = 0, we need to do nothing because
in this case the right hand side of (27) is zero. The ﬁrst part
is of length O(1), which is negligible compared to the second
part.
If both the sender and the legal receiver have the full
knowledge of t, then we only have to consider the single
wiretap channel (Wt , Vt ). In [6] and [7] it is shown that there
exists an (n, Jn , λ) code for the quantum wiretap channel

If for every t ∈ θ and n ∈ N, I(P, Bt ) ≥ I(P, Zt )
for all P ∈ P (A) and {wt (j) : j = 1, · · · , Jn } ⊂ S(H n ),
we have CCSI = mint∈θ maxP,wt (χ(P, Bt ) − χ(P, Zt )) (see
[11]).
So far, |θ| was ﬁnite. Now we consider the case when |θ|
can be arbitrary.

Lemma 3 there exists a ﬁnite set θ with |θ | ≤ ( τ )2d and
τ -nets (Wt )t ∈θ , (Vt )t ∈θ such that for every t ∈ θ we can
ﬁnd a t ∈ θ with Wt − Wt ♦ ≤ τ and Vt − Vt ♦ ≤ τ .
(t )
For every t ∈ θ the legal transmitters build a code C2 =
(t )
{wt , {Dt ,j : j}}. Since by [6], the error of the code C2
decreases exponentially to its length, we can ﬁnd an N =
O(− log ξ) such that for all t ∈ θ it holds

The sender sends “t ” if obtaining the state information “t”, we
have tr Wt⊗N − Wt⊗N (wt (j)) ≤ N τ , because we can

for each W there is a k ∈ {1, · · · , K} with W −W (k) ♦ < τ .
