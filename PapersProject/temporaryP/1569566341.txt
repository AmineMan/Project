Abstract— 1 Energy efﬁciency in wireless fading channels is studied in the presence of statistical quality of service (QoS) constraints.
Energy per bit is employed as the performance metric. Minimum
energy per bit and wideband slope expressions are determined
to quantify the energy efﬁciency in the low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime. In particular, the impact of channel and source
variations is investigated. A block-fading model in which fading
coefﬁcients are arbitrarily correlated in one block before assuming
independent realizations in the next one, is considered. Initially, the
effect of fading correlation on energy efﬁciency is analyzed. It is
shown that while minimum energy per bit does not depend on the
fading correlation, wideband slope decreases as positive correlation
increases, resulting in increased energy requirements at low but
nonzero SNR levels. Subsequently, an ON-OFF source arrival model
is considered. It is shown that while the minimum energy per bit
does not get affected by source variations, wideband slope diminishes
with increasing source burstiness. (”THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE
FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD”)

two simplifying assumptions in this work. We assumed that the
arrival rate was constant, and considered a block-fading model
in which the channel fading stayed the same in each block.
In this paper, we extend our analysis and address the impact of
source and channel variations. In particular, while still assuming
block-fading, we allow the fading coefﬁcients to be arbitrarily
correlated in each block. Also, we model random arrivals by
considering a simple ON-OFF source. We interestingly demonstrate that while channel variations known at the receiver improve
the energy efﬁciency under QoS constraints, source variations or
burstiness lead to increased energy requirements.

We consider a ﬂat-fading channel between the transmitter and
receiver. The channel input-output relation can be expressed as
yi = hi xi + ni for i = 1, 2, . . .

where xi and yi are the channel input and output, respectively.

Due to the fact that energy resources, especially in mobile
wireless scenarios, are scarce and have to be conserved, energy
efﬁciency has been an important consideration in most wireless systems. Fundamental limits on the energy efﬁciency of
data transmission has been studied in [1] from an informationtheoretic perspective. In particular, in this work, the tradeoff
between spectral efﬁciency and energy per bit is analyzed in
the wideband regime. The minimum energy required to send one
bit of information reliably is identiﬁed for a general class of
channels. Moreover, wideband slope is introduced as a tool to
investigate the performance at low but nonzero SNR levels.
In addition to energy efﬁciency, another important consideration in wireless systems is to provide quality of service
(QoS) guarantees. For instance, wireless multimedia transmissions, such as video streaming and interactive video, require
certain delay/buffer constraints to be satisﬁed in order to attain
acceptable performance levels. In [2] and [3], effective bandwidth
and effective capacity formulations are provided as performance
metrics to determine the maximum throughput in the presence
of statistical QoS constraints in the form of limitations on buffer
violation probability. Making use of these tools from stochastic
network calculus (see also e.g., [4] and [5]) and the informationtheoretic arguments, we have recently addressed energy efﬁciency
in fading channels under QoS constraints in [7]. However, we had

Above in (1), hi denotes the fading coefﬁcient. Fading coefﬁcients are assumed to be identically distributed, and the fading
distribution can be arbitrary with ﬁnite variance. We consider a
block-fading model and assume that the fading changes independently every m symbols. On the other hand, we assume that in
each duration of m symbols, fading can be arbitrarily correlated.
III. P RELIMINARIES
A. Effective Capacity
The effective capacity formulation provides the maximum
constant arrival rate that a given time-varying service process
can support while satisfying a QoS requirement speciﬁed by θ
[3]. If we deﬁne Q as the stationary queue length, then θ is the
decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length:
lim

q→∞

log P (Q ≥ q)
= −θ.

The above limiting formula implies that for large qmax , we
have P (Q ≥ qmax ) ≈ e−θqmax . Hence, when the threshold is

exponentially with rate controlled by the QoS exponent θ. Note
that as θ increases, more strict QoS constraints are imposed.

IV. E NERGY E FFICIENCY WITH C ORRELATED FADING
In this section, we assume that the source arrival rate is
ﬁxed. As discussed in the previous section, effective capacity,
CE (SNR, θ), characterizes the maximum constant arrival rate in
the presence of QoS constraints described by the QoS exponent
θ, and can also be seen as the maximum average transmission
rate. In the following result, we provide the minimum bit energy
and wideband slope expressions under these assumptions.
Theorem 1: Assume that the source arrival rate is constant.
Assume further that the channel fading changes independently
every m symbols while the channel fading coefﬁcients are
arbitrarily correlated in each duration of m symbols. Then, the
minimum energy per bit and wideband slope expressions as a
function of the QoS exponent θ are given, respectively, by

is the normalized version of the effective capacity in (5) in the
units of bits/channel use. Hence, CE (SNR, θ) can be regarded as
the spectral efﬁciency under QoS constraints. Note that effective capacity provides a characterization of the arrival process.
However, since the average arrival rate is equal to the average
departure rate when the queue is in steady-state [6], effective
capacity can also be seen as a measure of the transmission rate
under buffer constraints.
In our analysis, following the approach in [1], we will study the
minimum energy per bit and the wideband slope, which is deﬁned
as the slope of the spectral efﬁciency curve at zero spectral
efﬁciency. While the minimum bit energy is a performance
measure in the limit as SNR → 0, wideband slope has emerged
as a tool that enables us to analyze the energy efﬁciency at low
but nonzero SNR levels.

Proof: As can be seen from (10) and (12), we only need to
obtain the ﬁrst and second derivatives of CE (SNR, θ) with respect
to SNR at SNR = 0 to determine the minimum energy per bit and
wideband slope. We ﬁrst express the effective capacity given in

coefﬁcients and therefore {zi }’s are identically distributed.
Plugging the expressions in (21) and (22) into those in (10)
and (12), we readily obtain the minimum energy per bit and
wideband slope expressions in (13) and (14).
Remark 1: As can be seen in (13), the minimum energy per
bit, which is achieved in the asymptotic regime in which SNR
vanishes, does not depend on the QoS exponent θ, hence is not
affected by the presence of the buffer limitations. Indeed, this is
the fundamental limit in Gaussian channels [1].
Remark 2: Wideband slope S0 , on the other hand, depends on
θm
the QoS constraints through β = log 2 . Note that we have

S0 =

m

cov {zi , zj } = 1T E (z − E{z})(z − E{z})T 1
i=1 j=1

≥0

(23)

where 1 denotes the m-dimensional column vector of all ones,
and z = (z1 , z2 , . . . , zm )T is the column vector of fading
magnitude-squares. Hence, E (z − E{z})(z − E{z})T is the
covariance matrix of the random vector z and the inequality in
(23) follows from the positive semi-deﬁniteness of this matrix.
This observation leads to the conclusion that the presence of QoS
limitations (or equivalently having θ > 0) reduces the wideband
slope, increasing the energy requirements per bit. Additionally,
higher the value of θ, the more strict the QoS constraints are and
the smaller the value of the wideband slope is.
Remark 3: Finally, we discuss the effect of fading correlation.
Assume that the fading coefﬁcients are fully correlated and z1 =
z2 = . . . = zm = z. In this case, we have
cov(zi , zj ) = E{z 2 } − (E{z})2 = var(z) ∀i, j,

2(E {z})2

m var {z}

+ E {z 2 }

.

(29)

Overall, we note that the wideband slope increases and consequently the energy requirements in the low-SNR regime decreases
if the fading correlation becomes lower. Therefore, variations
in the channel conditions are favorable for improved energy
efﬁciency.
The above conclusion can be illustrated numerically. We consider a Gauss-Markov fading model and assume that the Gaussian
fading coefﬁcients in each block of m symbols follow the
correlation pattern hi = αhi−1 + wi where wi is an independent,
zero-mean Gaussian random variable with variance E{|wi |2 } =
2
2
(1 − α2 )σh , α ∈ [0, 1], and σh is the variance of the fading
coefﬁcients hi . Note that when α = 1, we have full correlation,
whereas α = 0 models the case of independent fading. In Fig. 1,
we plot the normalized effective capacity CE (SNR) as a function
E
of the energy per bit Nb for different correlation factors α when
0
2
θ = 1 and E{z} = E{|h|2 } = σh = 1. As predicted by
Theorem 1, all curves converge to the same minimum energy per
E
bit of Nb min = loge 2 = loge 2 = −1.59 dB as SNR and hence
E{z}
0
CE (SNR) vanish. On the other hand, wideband slopes are different
for different values of α. As discussed above, as α and hence
correlation diminishes from 1 to 0, slopes increase progressively.
It is also interesting note that in the absence of QoS constraints,
i.e., when θ = 0, such a distinction will disappear. The wideband
2
slope becomes S0 = 2(E{z}) , which clearly does not depend on
E{z 2 }
the fading correlations.

(28)

where (28) follows from our assumption that the fading coefﬁcients are identically distributed. Therefore, with full correlation
in fading, we attain the maximum value of cov(zi , zj ) as seen in
(24), and wideband slope is minimized.
The other extreme case is the one in which the fading coefﬁcients {zi }m in each duration of m symbols are uncorrelated
i=1
or independent. Now, we have cov(zi , zj ) = 0 for all i = j.
Hence, we are left with only the variance terms in the double
sum in the denominator of (14), and the wideband slope S0 can
be expressed as

In the following result, we provide the minimum energy per

Theorem 2: Assume that the source arrival rate is random and
follows the described ON-OFF model. As before, the channel
fading changes independently every m symbols while the channel
fading coefﬁcients are arbitrarily correlated in each duration of

are no arrivals in the OFF state. For this ON-OFF model, the
effective bandwidth, which characterizes the minimum constant

the given data arrival scheme under QoS constraints, is given by

As PON = p11 decreases, the wideband slope decreases as well.
Therefore, the source becoming more bursty leads to increased
energy per bit. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 where maximum
average arrival rate vs. energy per bit is plotted and the same
channel fading and correlation model as in Fig. 1 is used. In
this ﬁgure, we assume θ = 1 and α = 0.75. As predicted,
the minimum bit energies are all the same. However, we have
diminishing slopes with decreasing PON . Note that for a ﬁxed
average arrival rate, as PON gets smaller, source becomes more
bursty. Data arrives less frequently but with a higher rate. This
in turn increases energy per bit as implied by smaller wideband
slopes.
Finally, we remark that in the absence of buffer limitations
2
(i.e., when θ = 0), we again have S0 = 2(E{z}) . Hence, in such
E{z 2 }
a case, source and channel variations do not have any impact on
the performance in the low-SNR regime.

hand, the impact of random arrivals on the wideband slope is
perspicuous in (38). When compared to (14), we immediately
notice that having random arrivals leads to the introduction of
θm
the term (˜− 1) log 2 (E {z})2 in the denominator of (38). Notice

that when p11 = 1 and p00 = 0, we have PON = 1, meaning that
we have constant source arrival. In this case, ρ = 1 and indeed
˜
(38) specializes to (14). More generally, we have ρ −1 ≥ 0 for all
˜
p00 , p11 ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore, random arrivals potentially decreases
the wideband slope and increases the energy requirements.
This is more clearly seen in the special case in which p00 +
p11 = 1. Now, we have ρ = p1 and PON = p11 , and the
