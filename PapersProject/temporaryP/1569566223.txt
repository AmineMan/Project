On the Maximum A Posteriori Decoding
Thresholds of Multiuser Systems with Erasures

upper bounds on the MAP thresholds [8], [9]. This paper
focuses, however, on the erasure noise models. The simplicity
of these toy models allows one to perform a thorough analysis
and provide insights into the general case. For each problem,
we derive the appropriate EXIT curve and use the natural
area theorem to obtain an upper bound on the MAP threshold.
We then provide a counting argument that allows numerical
veriﬁcation of the bound’s tightness.
As mentioned earlier, one direct application of this analysis
is veriﬁcation of the threshold saturation phenomenon, the
underlying mechanism behind the impressive performance
of SC codes. While the BP thresholds of SC were recently
observed to get close to the Shannon limits of these considered problems [8], [10], with the MAP threshold evaluated
here, one can see that the BP thresholds of SC codes saturate
not just to some value that can be close to the “capacity”
but this value turn outs to be exactly the MAP threshold of
the underlying ensemble. Since the MAP thresholds can be
shown to converge to the Shannon limit as the node degrees
increase, it is not surprising that SC codes can achieve the
entire capacity region of the corresponding problems.
A. Preliminaries
The degree distribution (d.d.) of a standard LDPC ensemble is deﬁned, from the edge perspective, by the pair
of polynomials (λ, ρ) and, from the node perspective, by
(L, R) [1]. The LDPC ensemble of length n with d.d. (λ, ρ)
is denoted by LDPC(n, λ, ρ). We also consider two edge type
LDPC ensembles [11] whose d.d.s are deﬁned by

Abstract—A fundamental connection between the belief propagation (BP) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding thresholds was derived by Méasson, Montanari, and Urbanke using
the area theorem for extrinsic information transfer (EXIT)
curves. This connection allows the MAP threshold, for the
binary erasure channel, to be evaluated efﬁciently via an upper
bound that can be shown to be tight in some cases.
In this paper, a similar analysis is used to extend these
results to several multiuser systems, namely a noisy SlepianWolf problem and a multiple-access channel with erasures.
The simplicity of these channel models allows for rigorous
analysis and enables the derivation of upper bounds on the
MAP thresholds using EXIT area theorems. In some cases,
one can also show these bounds are tight. One interesting
application is that the MAP thresholds can be compared with
the BP thresholds of spatially-coupled codes to verify threshold
saturation for the corresponding systems.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The graph structure of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes leads naturally to belief propagation (BP), a lowcomplexity message-passing decoding, which is optimal if
the graph has no cycles. On the other hand, maximum a
posteriori (MAP) decoding is globally optimal but its complexity is prohibitively large in many scenarios. Associated
with each decoder is a maximum noise threshold, below
which it is possible to have reliable communication. In many
cases, there is a gap between the BP and MAP thresholds [1].
Evaluating these two thresholds, for an iterative decoding
system, is an important part of understanding the codes and
decoding algorithms.
An interesting example is the threshold saturation phenomenon of spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes, whereby
the BP threshold improves to the MAP threshold [2]. While
determining the BP threshold is straightforward via densityevolution (DE) analysis, evaluating the MAP threshold directly is problematic due to complexity issues. Fortunately,
for LDPC codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC), a
fundamental relationship between the BP and MAP thresholds can be found using extrinsic information transfer (EXIT)
curves. One can use this connection to upper bound the MAP
threshold [3]. This bounding technique has now been used in
various point-to-point communication problems [4], [5], [6]
and also to evaluate the MAP threshold of turbo codes [7].
In this paper, we use a similar analysis to evaluate the MAP
thresholds of LDPC codes over two multiuser systems: the
noisy Slepian-Wolf (SW) problem and the two-user multipleaccess channel (MAC). For more realistic noise models, one
can use generalized EXIT (GEXIT) analysis to compute

Throughout this paper, X[j] is used to denote a vector of
bits where [j] indicates user (or channel) j for j ∈ {1, 2}.

Likewise, Xi represents the ith bit and X [j] is sometimes
[j]
used if the bit index is not emphasized. For simplicity, X∼i
is used when the ith bit is omitted from the vector X[j] .
An erasure is denoted by ?. For SC codes, the (l, r, L, w)
ensemble deﬁned in [2] is considered. Due to the space
limitation, many of the results in this paper are presented
without complete proofs and the details can be found in [12].

i.i.d. Bernoulli- 1 random variables if Z = 0. The decoder

When the BP estimator is used instead of the MAP estimator, one also has the BP-EXIT function. The asymptotic BPEXIT function can be obtained by taking the average BPEXIT function over all the codes Cn and taking n → ∞ and
followed by the number of BP iterations → ∞. Using the
concentration theorem and the fact that, for a ﬁxed number of
iterations, the computation graph for a speciﬁc bit becomes
tree-like as n → ∞, one can compute the asymptotic BPEXIT function as follows.

Assume that the sequences U[1] and U[2] are encoded by

graph for an LDPC code and the SW problem with erasures

Generally speaking, the MAP threshold (along the curve
C) can be deﬁned as the supremum of all parameters such
that h( ) = 0. Likewise, one can deﬁne the BP threshold. By
the optimality of the MAP decoder, one can invoke the data
processing inequality [13] and have the following lemma.
Lemma 3: For the SWE, one has 0 ≤ h( ) ≤ hBP ( ) ≤ 2.
Remark 1: With the above analysis, one can use a similar
approach to [3] to obtain an upper bound on the MAP
threshold. ´More speciﬁcally, by ﬁnding the largest ¯MAP
1
such that ¯MAP hBP ( )d = H(U [1] , U [2] )r, one has MAP ≤
´1
´1
¯MAP which follows from ¯MAP h( )d ≤ ¯MAP hBP ( )d =
´1
H(U [1] , U [2] )r ≤ MAP h( )d .
To compute the area under the BP-EXIT curve, it is more
convenient to consider the extended BP (EBP) EXIT curve
that extends the BP-EXIT by also including the unstable f.p.s.

where f (t) (1 − p) + pt and y(t) 1 − ρ(1 − t). Here, x1
(resp. x2 ) is the average erasure rate of messages from bit
nodes to check nodes corresponding to source 1 (resp. 2) in
the limit of inﬁnite block length and inﬁnite number of BP
iterations. From this, one can write
[1]

(x1 , x2 ) = [x1 /λ(y(x1 )) − γf (L(y(x2 )))] /(1 − γ),

[2]

(x1 , x2 ) = [x2 /λ(y(x2 )) − γf (L(y(x1 )))] /(1 − γ).

Let us express x1 (x) and x2 (x) according to a common
parameter x, say x = x1 , and consider a smooth curve C
from (x1 (1), x2 (1)) = (1, 1) decreasing in both arguments.
This curve C can be characterized by a single parameter ∈
[0, 1], say = ( [1] + [2] )/2, and = 1 corresponds to the

residual graph is zero because if this is true, the MAP decoder
should decode perfectly for all < ¯MAP . One can use the
test in [11] to numerically verify this fact. For simplicity,
we focus on the curve C that extends linearly from (1, 1)
according to 1− [1] = A(1− [2] ) for some A > 0 where, e.g.,
A = 1 represents the symmetric channel condition. In Fig. 2
(a), the function θ(e1 , e2 ) (see [11, p. 11] for deﬁnition) for
the residual graph d.d. is plotted for the case A = 3 and one
2
can see that the maximum of θ(e1 , e2 ) over the unit square
is zero. Thus, the actual rate of the residual graph equals its
design rate, which is zero, with high probability as n → ∞.
This implies that the upper bound is tight and MAP = ¯MAP .

old because ¯MAP hBP ( )d = P (1) − P (xMAP ) = (2 − p)r.
If one considers regular LDPC ensembles of a ﬁxed rate,
using the property P (xMAP ) = 0, the following lemma
shows that, for sufﬁciently high degrees, ¯MAP approaches
the Shannon limit.
Lemma 5: Consider a sequence of (l, r)-regular ensembles where l → ∞ and the rate r = 1 − l is ﬁxed. Then, we
r
have ¯MAP (l, r) → Sh (r) where Sh (r) corresponds to the
boundary of the SW region along the curve C.
Lemma 6: Assume the joint BP decoder is run until it
reaches a f.p. Remove all known bits and merge pairs of
aligned bits that have the same value into larger bit nodes
and obtain a residual graph. The residual graph can be seen
as a two edge type LDPC ensemble and its expected d.d.

A. Channel Model
In this section, we consider the two-user MAC channel
with erasure noise (EMAC) discussed in [10] and evaluate
the MAP threshold when the two users transmit LDPC codes.

[2]
Let the inputs Xi , Xi ∈ {±1} then the output is given by

and therefore the Shannon limit, i.e., the supremum of all
erasure rates that allows reliable communication for both
2
users, is Sh (r1 , r2 ) = min 1 − r1 , 1 − r2 , 1 − 3 (r1 + r2 ) .
[j]
We consider X to be chosen uniformly at random from
LDPC(n, λ[j] , ρ[j] ) for j ∈ {1, 2}, respectively. If one uses
the joint BP decoder operating on the Tanner graph in Fig.
3, then the DE f.p. equation is given by

and yj (xj ) 1 − ρ[j] (1 − xj ) for j = 1, 2. One can express
the f.p. pair (x1 , x2 ) as a function of a common parameter
x, say x = x1 . Thus, one can write (x), x1 (x) and x2 (x)
to emphasize the dependence on x and note that (1) = 1.
With some abuse of notation, we write yj (x) as a shorthand
notation of yj (xj (x)) for j = 1, 2.

Therefore, one can see from (1), Lemma 4 and Corollary

B. EXIT Functions
Deﬁnition 3: Consider sequences of LDPC(n, λ[1] , ρ[1] )
[j]
and LDPC(n, λ[2] , ρ[2] ) ensembles. For each n, pick Cn
[j] [j]
[j]
uniformly at random from LDPC(n, λ , ρ ). Let X be
[j]
chosen uniformly from Cn for j ∈ {1, 2} and Y be the
received sequence at the output of the EMAC with erasure
[1]
probability . The MAP-EXIT function (associated with Cn
[2]
and Cn ) is deﬁned by

0 ≤ h( ) ≤ hBP ( ) ≤ 3/2.
Thus, one can invoke the standard MAP bounding technique,
´1
i.e., ﬁnding the largest ¯MAP such that ¯MAP hBP ( )d = r1 +
r2 and obtaining MAP ≤ ¯MAP as a result.
To conveniently compute the area under the BP-EXIT
curve, we deﬁne the EBP-EXIT curve as follows.
Deﬁnition 4: The EBP-EXIT curve for the EMAC is

Corollary 3: The EBP-EXIT curve for the EMAC satisﬁes

the area theorem 0 hEBP (t)dt = P (1) = r1 + r2 .

0, then ¯MAP
(xMAP ) ≥ MAP upper bounds the MAP

threshold because ¯MAP hBP ( )d = P (1) − P (xMAP ) = r1+r2 .
Again, by considering regular LDPC ensembles of a ﬁxed
rate and using the property P (xMAP ) = 0, ¯MAP can be shown
to approach the Shannon limit.
Lemma 11: Consider a sequence of regular ensembles
(i.e., (l[1] , r[1] ) and (l[2] , r[2] )) and assume l[j] → ∞ so
that rj = (r[j] − l[j] )/r[j] is ﬁxed (for j ∈ {1, 2}). Then,
¯MAP (l[1] , r[1] , l[2] , r[2] ) → Sh (r1 , r2 ).
Lemma 12: Assume the joint BP decoder is run until it
reaches a ﬁxed point. Next, remove all the known bits and
their adjacent edges and check nodes. Further, merge any
pair of bit nodes at the same index that have the same value.
The residual graph can be seen as a two edge type LDPC

as well as Lemma 10 and Corollary 4.
Remark 3: Similar to Remark 2, one can use the test
in [11, p. 11] to show the tightness of the bound. For
example, let us consider the case when user 1 and user 2
use the (3, 6)-regular and (3, 9)-regular LDPC ensembles,
respectively. From Fig. 2 (b), the maximum of θ(e1 , e2 ),
for the corresponding residual graph, over the unit square
is zero. Ths implies that the actual rate of the residual graph
equals its design rate with high probability as n → ∞ and
consequently, the MAP upper bound is tight.
IV. T HRESHOLD S ATURATION OF SC C ODES
One important application of our analysis is that one can
compare the MAP thresholds of uncoupled LDPC ensembles
with the BP thresholds of SC ensembles to observe the
threshold saturation. This can be nicely seen by plotting the
BP-EXIT curves for both the coupled and uncoupled systems.
In Fig. 4 (a), the BP-EXIT curves for the (4, 6, L, 5) SC
ensembles based on the punctured (4, 6)-regular ensemble
(see [8]) are plotted for the SWE with an asymmetric channel
3
condition (A = 2 ). It can be seen that as L increases,
these curves saturate to the MAP threshold of the uncoupled
system. Similarly, in Fig. 4 (b) for the EMAC, the BP-EXIT
curves for the (3, 6, 3, 9, L, 5) SC system, i.e., the two users
use the (3, 6, L, 5) and (3, 9, L, 9) ensembles respectively,
also saturate to the MAP threshold of the uncoupled system.
Similar plots for the SWE with symmetric channel conditions
(A = 1) and the EMAC with symmetric user rates (r1 = r2 )
are also given in [8], [10], bit without rigorous consideration
of the MAP thresholds.
The main result of this paper is the MAP threshold
evaluation and not the BP threshold of SC. Still, this analysis
allows one to observe that the saturation point of the BP
thresholds for SC equals the MAP threshold of the underlying
ensembles for these two multiuser problems. In particular,
