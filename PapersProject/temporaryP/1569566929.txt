High-SNR Analysis of MIMO Linear Precoders

Abstract—For linear MIMO precoders, the diversity is an
important parameter affecting broad tradeoffs in system design,
however, the diversity of many MIMO precoders has not been
available in the open literature. This paper analyzes the diversity of the following MIMO precoders: the zero-forcing (ZF),
regularized ZF, matched ﬁltering and Wiener ﬁltering. Several
interesting properties of these precoders are revealed by this
analysis. It is shown that regularized ZF (RZF) and the matched
ﬁlter (MF) exhibit two-mode diversity: full diversity at low rates
R and error ﬂoor at high rates. The rate threshold of this twomode behavior is analytically determined. The Wiener precoder
is also shown to produce a diversity that depends on the spectral
efﬁciency and can be as small as one and as large as the product
of the number of transmit and receive antennas.

We consider a ﬂat fading channel H ∈ CN ×M , where
M and N are the number of transmit and receive antennas
respectively, with N M . The input-output system model is
given by
y = HTx + n

(1)

where T ∈ CM ×B is the precoder matrix. The number of
information symbols is B min(M, N ) = N , the transmitted
vector is x ∈ C B×1 , and n ∈ C N ×1 is the Gaussian noise
vector. The vectors x and n are assumed independent.
The objective of linear precoding (possibly together with
linear equalization at the receiver) is to transform the MIMO
channel into min(M, N ) parallel channels that can be described by

I. I NTRODUCTION
Although many of the MIMO beneﬁts are realizable when
only the receiver knows the channel, these beneﬁts can
be greatly enhanced when the receiver feeds back to the
transmitter [1]. In MIMO communications, knowledge of the
channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) can be
used in a variety of beneﬁcial ways [2], [3], [4]. Linear
precoding is a simple and efﬁcient method that exploits the
CSIT to match the transmission to the instantaneous channel
conditions [5]. Under certain conditions, linear precoders are
known to approach optimality [6], [7].

γk xk + nk ,

k = 1, . . . , B

where γk is the SINR at the k-th receiver output and we
set B = min(M, N ). Let ρ be the transmitted equivalent
SNR, we deﬁne the outage probability and the outage diversity
as [10]
Pout

The classes of linear precoders include zero-forcing (ZF),
regularized zero-forcing (RZF), matched ﬁltering (MF) and
Wiener ﬁltering. ZF precoding and its variations use various
forms of channel inversion, for example the pseudo-inverse or
other generalized inverses [5].
In this paper, we analyze the diversity of common linear
precoders. It is shown that RZF and MF precoders exhibit a
two-mode diversity behavior that has not to date been precisely
reported or analyzed: they either have full diversity or zero
diversity (error ﬂoor) and the modes are triggered based on
whether the spectral efﬁciency R is above or below a threshold
that is calculated in this work.

In this paper we characterize the diversity gain, d(R, M, N ),
as a function of the spectral efﬁciency R (b/s/Hz) and the
number of transmit and receive antennas. This usually requires
the analysis of the pairwise error probability (PEP). We shall
perform outage analysis for different precoding systems as
the ﬁrst step towards deriving the diversity function. The PEP
analysis follows similarly to [10], [9]. This two-step approach
was ﬁrst proposed in [12] due to the intractability of the direct
PEP analysis for many MIMO architectures.
We denote the exponential equality of two functions
.
f (ρ) and g(ρ) as f (p) = g(p) when limρ→∞ log f (ρ) =
log(ρ)

The diversity of the ZF and Wiener precoding systems are
also calculated. It is shown that these two precoding schemes
exhibit diversity performance similar to their counterparts at
the receive sides [8], [9]. More precisely the Wiener precoder
produces a diversity that is a function of spectral efﬁciency as
well as the number of transmit and receive antennas whereas
the ZF precoder produces a diversity that is only function of
the number of antennas. At very low rates, the Wiener precoder
obtains a maximal diversity which is the product of the number
of transmit and receive antennas, while at very high rates a
minimal diversity is achieved which is the same as the ZF
precoding diversity.

limρ→∞ log g(ρ) . In the following, we shall need to specify

various upper and lower bounds or approximations of the
SINR γ, which will give rise to a number of pseudo-SINR
variables γ , γ , and γ .

IV. R EGULARIZED Z ERO -F ORCING P RECODING

The ZF precoder completely eliminates the interference at
the receiver. ZF precoding is well studied in the literature via
performance measures such as throughput and fairness under
a total (or per antenna) power constraint [13, and references
therein]. One approach to design the ZF precoder is to solve
the following optimization problem [5]

In general, direct channel inversion performs poorly due
to the singular value spread of the channel matrix [17]. One
technique often used is to regularize the channel inversion:

T = arg min E ||Tx||2 ,
2
T

subject to HT = I.

T = β HH (HHH + c I)−1

where β is a normalization factor and c is a ﬁxed constant.
The eigen decomposition of the Wishart channel is HHH =
UΛ UH , where the matrix U ∈ CN ×N is unitary and Λ ∈
RN ×N is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the
eigenvalues of HHH . Let uk be the k-th column of UH and
ukl is the (k, l) entry of the matrix U. Recall that

(5)

The resulting ZF transmit ﬁlter is given by
T = β HH (HHH )−1

y = HTx + n = βUΛ(Λ + c I)−1 UH x + n.

where β is a scaling factor to satisfy the transmit power
constraint [5]: β 2 tr TTH

the maximum exponent which corresponds to αmin dominates

follows closely that of the RZF precoding. The pairwise error

system. Thus we conclude that Theorem 1 applies for TxMF.

This section produces numerical results for the outage probabilities of ZF, regularized ZF (RZF), matched ﬁlter (MF) and
Wiener precoding systems. Figure 1 shows an error ﬂoor for
the regularized ZF and matched ﬁltering precoded 2×2 system
at high rates. However we observe that the maximum diversity
is achieved for any rate R < 2 as predicted by Theorem 1.
Figure 2 shows the outage probabilities of the ZF and Wienerﬁlter precoded 2×2 MIMO systems. The diversities calculated
from the simulations match the theoretical ones. Figure 3
shows the outage probabilities for a 3 × 3 MIMO system with
Wiener precoding. The diversity for the rates R = 1.5, 4, and
5 b/s/Hz is 9, 4 and 1 respectively (cf. Eq (42)).

both systems are equivalent. This can be shown by computing
the SINR of the MMSE equalizer outputs in a MIMO channel

that the outage diversity dRZF = M N if the operating spectral

Linear precoders provide a simple and efﬁcient processing,
and have been shown to be optimal in some scenarios [6],
[7]. This paper studies the high-SNR performance of linearly
precoded MIMO systems. It is shown that the regularized
zero-forcing (RZF) precoding with a constant regularization
parameter and mathced ﬁltering (MF) precoding achieve full
diversity up to a certain spectral efﬁciency, while at higher
spectral efﬁciencies they produce an error ﬂoor. It is also
shown that Wiener ﬁlter precoding (RZF with optimized
regularization parameter) exhibits a rate-dependent behavior
similarly to the linear MMSE MIMO receivers [9]. The zeroforcing pecoding diversity is also analyzed.
