block. The parameter T can be thought of as the channel’s
coherence time. Even if the capacity of the Rayleigh blockfading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel has been
studied extensively in the literature [2], [6], [3], [7], no closedform capacity expression is available to date. Zheng and Tse [3]
showed that the capacity C grows as

Abstract—We analyze the capacity of Rayleigh block-fading
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in the noncoherent setting and prove that unitary space-time modulation (USTM) is
not capacity-achieving when the total number of antennas exceeds
the coherence time of the fading channel. This situation is relevant
for MIMO systems with large antenna arrays (large-MIMO systems). Our result settles a conjecture by Zheng & Tse (2002) in the
afﬁrmative. The capacity-achieving input signal, which we refer
to as Beta-variate space-time modulation (BSTM), turns out to be
the product of a unitary isotropically distributed random matrix,
and a diagonal matrix whose nonzero entries are distributed as
the square-root of the eigenvalues of a Beta-distributed random
matrix of appropriate size. Numerical results illustrate that using
BSTM instead of USTM in large-MIMO systems yields a rate gain
as large as 13% for SNR values of practical interest.

Here, ρ denotes the SNR, M ∗ = min{M, N, T /2 }, with M
and N standing for the number of transmit and receive antennas,
respectively, and O(1) indicates a bounded function of ρ (for
sufﬁciently large ρ). The capacity expression (1) implies that,
at high SNR, the capacity loss due to lack of a priori channel
knowledge is large when the channel’s coherence time T is small.
It also implies that at high SNR, the capacity-maximizing number
of transmit antennas M (for ﬁxed T and a ﬁxed number of receive
antennas N ) is min{N, T /2 }.
When T ≥ M + N (channel’s coherence time larger or equal
to the total number of antennas), the high-SNR expression (1)
can be tightened as follows [3, Sec. IV.B]

I. I NTRODUCTION

The use of multiple antennas increases tremendously the
throughput of wireless systems operating over fading channels.
Speciﬁcally, when a genie provides the receiver with perfect
channel state information (the so called coherent setting), the
capacity of a multiple-antenna fading channel grows linearly
in the minimum between the number of transmit and receive
antennas [1]. In practice, however, the fading channel is not

this case, USTM, i.e., setting X = T Φ, with Φ unitary and
isotropically distributed, achieves (6). When T < M + N , the

implies that USTM is not capacity-achieving at high SNR, as
formalized in the following corollary.

I(x; Y) = h(Y) − h(Y | x).

where

h(u1 ) = log π T −1 /Γ(T ) ; h(v1 ) = log 2π N /Γ(N ) . (13)

Note that Y is conditionally Gaussian given x. Hence, the second

h(Y | x) = N E log ρ x

Lem. 12 and Lem. 13])

(11)

h(Y | σ1 ) = (N − 1)(T − 1) log(πe) + o(1), ρ → ∞

To compute h(Y), we observe that, in the absence of additive
noise W, the columns of Y are collinear with x and, hence,
Y has rank 1. Once Gaussian noise is added, Y becomes full
rank. However, because a rank-1 matrix of dimension T × N is
characterized by T + N − 1 parameters, the remaining T N −
(T + N − 1) = (T − 1)(N − 1) parameters describing Y must
contain information about the additive noise only in the ρ → ∞
limit. Hence, we expect that—for an appropriate choice of the
input distribution—h(Y) should grow as (T + N − 1) log(ρ).
To establish this result, it is convenient to express Y in terms
of its singular value decomposition (SVD). Speciﬁcally, we write
Y as

D. The Capacity-Achieving Input Distribution
Matrix-variate distributions: We are now ready to describe the
input distribution that achieves (6) for the general MIMO case.
The following preliminary results from multivariate statistics
will be needed.
Deﬁnition 4: An m × m random matrix A is said to have the
complex Wishart distribution with n > 0 degrees of freedom
and covariance matrix Σ if A = BBH , where the columns of
the m × n matrix B are independent and CN (0, Σ)-distributed.
In this case, we shall write A ∼ Wm (n, Σ).
Note that when m > n, the matrix A is singular and, hence,
does not admit a pdf. In this case, the probability distribution
on A is sometimes referred to as pseudo-Wishart or singular
Wishart. When m = 1, the Wishart distribution reduces to the
Gamma distribution.
Deﬁnition 5: An m × m random matrix C is said to have a
complex matrix-variate Beta distribution of parameters p > 0
−1
and n > 0 if C can be written as C = TH
AT−1 , where
A ∼ Wm (p, Σ) and B ∼ Wm (n, Σ) are independent, and
A + B = TH T, with T upper-triangular with positive diagonal
elements (Cholesky factorization). In this case, we shall write
C ∼ Betam (p, n).
Let C ∼ Betam (p, n) with p ≥ m > 0 and n > 0. The pdf
of the ordered eigenvalues λ1 > · · · > λm of C takes on two
different forms according to the value of n. If n ≥ m, then

h( h · x ) = h(g) − log

.

Note that maximizing the RHS of (15) amounts to maximizing

these two terms separately.
For the second term on the RHS of (17), we note that, as
E g 2 = E h 2 · x 2 ≤ T N , then
h(g) ≤ Q log(πeT N /Q)

If 0 < n < m, the eigenvalues of C are distributed as follows

(19)

Now note that h 2 ∼ Gamma(N, 1). Hence, for the case Q =
N , we can attain (19) by setting x 2 = T with probability
one (w.p.1). When Q = T − 1, however, we need to choose
˜
˜
x 2 = T N d2 /(T − 1) with d2 ∼ Beta(T − 1, N + 1 − T )
to fulﬁll (19). This follows from Lemma 3 below, which is a
special case of Lemma 6 in Section III-D.
Lemma 3: Let u ∼ Beta(p, n) with p, n ≥ 0; let also
r ∼ Gamma(p + n, 1) independent of u. Then (u · r) ∼
Gamma(p, 1).
For the third term on the RHS of (17), we note that, as T −
Q − 1 ≥ 0, Jensen’s inequality yields

The following lemma generalizes Lemma 3 to matrix-variate
distributions
Lemma 6: Let S ∼ Wm (p + n, Σ) with m > 0, n > 0, and
p ≥ m. Furthermore, let C ∼ Betam (p, n) be independent of
(T − Q − 1) E log x 2 ≤ (T − Q − 1) log(T ). (20)
S. Finally, put S = TH T, where T is upper-triangular with
Equality in (20) is achieved if x 2 = T w.p.1, or if Q = T − 1, positive diagonal elements. Then, A = TH CT ∼ Wm (p, Σ).
Proof: The theorem follows from a generalization to the
in which case both sides of (20) vanish.
Summarizing, when T ≥ N + 1, it is sufﬁcient to take complex case of [16, Thm. 3.3.1] for the nonsingular case n ≥ m,

The use of USTM is motivated by several practical considerations [6], [7], [18]. Is it then worth to replace USTM by the
capacity-achieving BSTM in the large-MIMO setting? In this
section, we shall investigate the rate gain that results from the
use of BSTM instead of USTM when T < M + N .
Asymptotic Analysis: In Corollary 7 below we show that
the rate gain resulting from using BSTM instead of USTM grows
logarithmically in the number of receive antennas.

Proof: The proof is omitted for space limitations and can
be found in [14, Sec. III.C].
Numerical Results: Let C(ρ) be the high-SNR approximation of C(ρ) obtained by neglecting the o(1) term in (6).
Similarly, let L(ρ) be the high-SNR approximation of L(ρ)
obtained by neglecting o(1) in (8). As can be inferred from
the results reported in [3], [7], [8], L(ρ) is a good approximation for L(ρ) when ρ
20 dB. Numerical evidence suggests
that the same holds for C(ρ) and C(ρ). To illustrate the gain
resulting from the use of BSTM instead of USTM for a ﬁnite
(but large) number of receive antennas, we plot in Fig. 1 the
ratio [C(ρ) − L(ρ)]/L(ρ) for different values of T and N , when
ρ = 30 dB and M = min{ T /2 , N }. We observe from Fig. 1
that the rate gain resulting from the use of BSTM instead of
USTM becomes signiﬁcant when the number of receive antennas
N is much larger than the channel’s coherence time T . For
example, when N = 100 and T = 10, the rate gain amounts to
13%. However, when T = N = 100 the rate gain is below 3%.
