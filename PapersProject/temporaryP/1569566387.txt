Abstract—We consider the diamond network where a source
communicates with the destination through N non-interfering
half-duplex relays. Deriving a simple approximation to the
capacity of the network, we show that simple schedules having
exactly two states and avoiding broadcast and multiple access
communication can still achieve a signiﬁcant constant fraction of
the capacity of the 2 relay network, independent of the channel
SNRs. The results are extended to the case of 3 relays for
the special class of antisymmetric networks. We also study the
structure of (approximately) optimal relaying strategies for such
networks. Simulations show that these schedules have at most
N + 1 states, which we conjecture to be true in general. We
prove the conjecture for N = 2 and for special cases for N = 3.1

The Gaussian N -relay half-duplex diamond network.

half-duplex diamond networks. In the rest of the paper: Section II provides the framework of our work, i.e., the network
model, a simple approximation to the capacity of the halfduplex diamond network, the rate achieved by the simple
strategies of interest and a Linear Programming (LP) problem
formulation; Section III establishes lower bounds on the rates
achieved by the simple strategies; Section IV presents our
conjecture regarding the linear number of active states in the
(approximately) optimal schedule.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Calculating the capacity of wireless relay networks is a hard
problem; calculating the capacity when the relays are halfduplex is even harder. Indeed, in half duplex relay networks,
an additional dimension of optimization comes into play:
scheduling the relay states, i.e., whether each relay transmits
(T ) or listens (L) at any given time instance [5]. For example, for the N -relay diamond network in Fig. 1, there exist
2N possible combinations of L, T states, and any capacity
achieving strategy would need to optimize for how long each
of these occurs.
In this paper, we consider half-duplex diamond networks
[7]. Our position is the following: at least for small diamond
networks, there might be no need for such an exponential
size optimization. We base this claim on two observations.
First, following the network simpliﬁcation approach of [4], we
show that even very simple schedules that use only two states
and employ point-to-point connections (no broadcasting and
no multiple access) can (approximately) achieve a rate that
is a signiﬁcant multiplicative fraction of the capacity of the
whole network. This multiplicative fraction is independent of
the strength of the links in the 2 and 3 relay diamond networks
and the operating SNR. Second, the approximately optimal
schedule may have at most N + 1 active states, instead of
the possible 2N . For example, for 2 relays, although 4 states
are possible, at most 3 are employed (this directly follows
from the work in [2]), while for 3 relays, only 4 out of the
8 possible states are employed. This conjecture is supported
by experimental results, as well as analytic proofs for some
special cases.
The aim of this paper is to show that even with reduced
schedule complexity, signiﬁcant rates are achievable for small

II. N ETWORK M ODEL AND P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
A. Network Model
We consider the Gaussian N -relay diamond network where
a source S transmits information to a destination D with the
help of half-duplex relays. At any given time t, each relay Ri
can either listen (L) or transmit (T ), but not both; we denote
by Mi [t] ∈ {L, T } its state. We denote by Ms [t] and Md [t]
the states of the source and the destination, respectively.
Let Xs [t] be the signal transmitted by S at time t, Xi [t] be
the signal transmitted by relay Ri , Yd [t] and Yi [t] the signals
received by D and Ri , respectively. Then
Xi [t] = 0 when Mi [t] = L
Yi [t]

Yd [t]

= 0 when Md [t] = T
where his , hid are the complex channel coefﬁcients between
S and Ri and Ri and D, respectively. Zi [t] and Z[t] are
independent and identically distributed white Gaussian random
processes of power spectral density N0 /2 Watts/Hz.
The power constraints for the source and all the relays are
ﬁxed to P . We can then calculate the individual link capacities
from S to Ri as Ris = log(1 + |his |2 P ) and from Ri to D as
Rid = log(1 + |hid |2 P ). [N ] represents the set {1, 2, · · · , N }
and the relays are ordered such that Ris ≥ Rjs for i < j.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, the term “constant” will mean

B. An Approximation to the Capacity

i∈[N ]

For half-duplex relay networks, the capacity depends not
only on the strength of the channel coefﬁcients, but crucially
also on the L-T scheduling. Let m ∈ M = {L, T }N denote a
particular state of the relays and let L(m) and T (m) be the set
of relays in listening and transmitting state in m, respectively.
In a particular schedule, let p(m) denote the fraction of time
N
the relays are in state m. Let Chd be the capacity of the N relay half-duplex diamond network. [6, Section VI] derives an
upper bound on the capacity of arbitrary half-duplex wireless
networks, which combined with the simpliﬁcation approach
developed in [4] for diamond networks, yields the following
N
upper bound on Chd .

2-relay simple strategy: With two relays, we use the
Mutihop-Decode-Forward (MDF) strategy as deﬁned in [2],
[8]. A pair of relays Ri and Rj (i < j) are operated in a
complementary fashion, using only the two states {L, T } and
{T, L}. Each of the relay performs decode-and-forward. Let
p1 , p2 be the fraction of time (Ri , Rj ) are in the states (L, T )
and (T, L) respectively. Then the maximum rate achieved by
this strategy is given by
Cs2,ij = max min(p1 Ris , p2 Rid ) + min(p2 Rjs , p1 Rjd )
p ,p

p1 +p2 =1

Note that the ﬁrst term is the rate carried by the ﬁrst relay
and the second term is the rate carried by the second relay.
Assuming Ris ≥ Rjs , the maximization can be solved to
obtain ([2], [8])
Ris (Rjs + Rid )
Cs2,ij =
if Ris Rjs < Rid Rjd
Ris + Rid
Rid (Ris + Rjd )
=
if Ris Rjs ≥ Rid Rjd , Rjd < Rid
Ris + Rid
Rjd (Rjs + Rid )
=
if Ris Rjs ≥ Rid Rjd , Rjd ≥ Rid
Rjs + Rjd
The best achievable rate Cs2 by this strategy is given by a
maximization over all possible choices for the two relays, i.e.,
(3)
Cs2 = max Cs2,ij

Rid

The minimization is over all the 2N subsets Λ of the relay
nodes [N ] = {R1 , . . . , RN } and the maximization is over all
schedules p(.) such that m∈M p(m) = 1. Starting with the
cutset-upper bound to the capacity of the network similar to
[4], the main idea in the proof is to show that the values
of the broadcast and multiple-access cuts can be bounded
by the maximum capacity of the individual constituent links
within a certain constant gap. Following [1], [6], we can also
N
show that CLP is achievable by quantize-map-and-forward
N
scheme within an additive constant gap. This is because CLP
is smaller than the cutset-upper bound to the capacity of the
network and these works show that the cutset-upper bound
is achievable within a certain gap. Therefore, we get the
N
following approximation for the capacity Chd
Theorem 2.2: For a N relay half-duplex diamond network,
there exist constants G(N ) and G (N ) such that

Finally, suppose we can show that a particular relaying strategy
achieves a rate C . Then the next result, which follows easily
from Theorem 2.2, can be used to prove bounds on the rates
achievable by our simple strategies.

C. Simple Strategies

pi = 1; ∀i, pi ≥ 0, C ≥ 0

We deﬁne simple strategies to be relaying strategies that
use exactly two states and avoid broadcast at the source and
multiple access at the destination. Concretely, we look at the
rates achievable under the Decode-Forward scheme:
1-relay simple strategy: Let Cs1,i be the maximum
achievable rate over the one hop network S-Ri -D when the
relay node Ri decodes the source message, re-encodes and
transmits it to D. Let p1 , p2 be the fraction of time Ri is in
the L and T state, respectively. Then
Cs1,i = max min(Ris p1 , Rid p2 )

The 2N variables of type p(m) have been numbered as pi with
mi being the corresponding state. LP1 can be visualized in a
matrix form as follows. (All vectors are column vectors)

A[p C] ≥ b; [p C] ≥ 0
where the objective function vector cT is of size 1 × (2N + 1),

where f1 (a, b, c) = a2 b − ab2 + a2 c − 8abc + 8b2 c + ac2 .
Writing f1 as a quadratic expression in c, we have
f1 (a, b, c) = ac2 + (a2 − 8ab + 8b2 )c + ab(a − b)
Clearly, if a2 − 8ab + 8b2 ≥ 0, then f1 (a, b, c) ≥ 0. Since the
equation x2 − 8x + 8 = 0 has two roots approximately equal
to 1.17 and 6.82, as long as a/b ∈ [1, 1.17] ∪ [6.82, +∞],
a2 − 8ab + 8b2 ≥ 0 and hence f1 (a, b, c) ≥ 0. On the other
hand, we can also look at f1 as a quadratic function in c and
look at its discriminant as a function of a, b. We have
Δa,b = (a2 − 8ab + 8b2 )2 − 4a(ab(a − b))

= −1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ 2N ; i = 2N + 1
= −1 for k = 2N + 1; 1 ≤ i ≤ 2N
= 0 for k = 2N + 1; i = 2N + 1
where Λ(k) is the k-th subset of [N ]. b is a (2N + 1) × 1
vector with all zero entries except the last one which is 1. The variable vector [p C] consists of the 2N variables
{p1 , p2 , · · · , p2N } and the (approximate) capacity variable C.
The dual of LP1, denoted by DLP1, is a minimization problem
deﬁned as follows.
(DLP1)
Minimize cT [pd Cd ]
A[pd Cd ] ≤ b; [pd Cd ] ≥ 0

= (a − 2b)2 (a2 − 16ab + 16b2 )
Since the roots of x2 − 16x + 16 = 0 are approximately 1.07
and 14.92, the discriminant Δa,b < 0 if 1.07 ≤ a/b ≤ 14.92,
in which case f1 as a function of c is non-negative. Since
the interval [1, 1.17] ∪ [6.82, +∞] ∪ [1.07, 14.92] covers all
possible values of a/b, we can conclude that f1 (a, b, c) ≥ 0
in all cases. Hence

expressions for capacities, we have

III. P ERFORMANCE OF S IMPLE S TRATEGIES
In [4], it was shown that for full-duplex N -relay diamond
networks, we can always ﬁnd a k-relay subnetwork that apk
proximately achieves k+1 fraction of the full-duplex network
capacity within an additive constant factor; for half-duplex,
this implies the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1: For a N -relay half-duplex diamond network,
there exist a k relay subnetwork that approximately achieves
k
2(k+1) of the capacity of the whole network within constant
additive factors.
Therefore, a 1-relay subnetwork can approximately achieve
1/4 and a 2 relay subnetwork 1/3 of the network’s capacity
for any N . Network simpliﬁcation [4] for half-duplex relays
involves both using fewer relays and fewer number of states in
the schedule. Therefore, what we show below can be thought
of as improved simpliﬁcation bounds for N = 2 and N = 3.
A. 2 Relay Networks
2
As shown in [2], the linear program for CLP can be solved
exactly to obtain closed form expressions. Using them, we can
prove the following result.
Lemma 3.2: For a 2-relay half-duplex diamond network, for
some constants c1 , c2 ,

Proof: We show that Cs1 ≥ 1 CLP and Cs2 ≥ 8 CLP ,

whence the result follows from Lemma 2.3. For brevity,
assume {R1s , R2s , R1d , R2d } = {a, b, c, d}. Note that a ≥ b.
We will show the proofs for the case (ab < cd). The other
cases are similar. In this case, we have

To summarize, we have shown that for the 2-relay diamond
network, we can universally achieve approximately 50% of the
capacity using the 1-relay simple strategy and 88% by using
the 2-relay simple strategy, independent of the channel SNRs.
B. 3 Relay Antisymmetric Networks
For the case of N = 3 relays, it is difﬁcult to obtain
3
closed form expressions for CLP involving the six terms
(R1s , R2s , R3s , R1d , R2d , R3d ). We distinguish the relay networks according to the order of the relative values of these
capacities. Assuming that R1s ≥ R2s ≥ R3s , the Rid values
can occur in six possible permutations. Although bounds can
be obtained for each of the cases separately, we present here
the results for the special case of antisymmetric networks
where R1s ≥ R2s ≥ R3s and R1d ≤ R2d ≤ R3d .
Lemma 3.4: For the anti-symmetric 3-relay half-duplex diamond network, for some constants c3 , c4 ,

IV. T HE C OMPLEXITY OF O PTIMAL S CHEDULES
In general, the optimal schedule in LP1 corresponding to
N
CLP can have 2N active states; we here present our conjecture
that in fact, there always exists an optimal schedule with a
linear number of active states. If true, this offers a signiﬁcant
reduction (from exponential to linear) to the number of states
needed for optimal operation, making it more feasible to
implement such schedules in practice.
Conjecture: For a N relay half-duplex diamond network,
N
there exists a schedule that optimizes the value of CLP and
has at most N + 1 active states.
We support this conjecture in two ways:
Experimental results: Fig. 2 shows numerical evaluation
results for LP1. We plot the average number of active states
in the optimal schedule as a function of the number of relays
N . The average is taken over several random instances of the
networks, where the SNRs of the source to relay and relay to
destination channels are chosen independently and uniformly

In other words [p C] is a feasible solution for LP1. We will
now consider the dual program and solve for the submatrix
of the dual consisting of columns J1 , J2 , J3 , J4 , J9 and rows
I1 , I4 , I7 , I8 , I9 , which is the transpose of S considered above.
Note that the dual variables in the DP1 correspond to the rows
in LP1. The corresponding form of DLP1 with equality is

Proof for special cases: For the case of N = 2 relays,
the claim follows easily by directly evaluating the optimal
schedule [2] and checking that there are at most three states.
We have not been able to come up with a general proof for
N > 2. In what follows, we prove the conjecture for a special
case of N = 3. Redeﬁne {R1s , R2s , R3s , R1d , R2d , R3d } =
{a, b, c, d, e, f } Consider the case when the point to point
capacities of all the relay to destination links dominates those
of the source to relay links or vice-versa.
Lemma 4.1: For a 3-relay half-duplex diamond network
where min{d, e, f } ≥ max{a, b, c} or min{a, b, c} ≥
max{d, e, f }, the optimal solution for LP1 has exactly 4 nonzero states.
Proof: Assume min{d, e, f } ≥ max{a, b, c}. The matrix
corresponding to LP1 is the same as the one mentioned
in the proof of Lemma 3.4. Name the rows of the matrix
as I1 , · · · , I9 and columns as J1 , · · · , J9 . Consider the submatrix S formed using rows I1 , I4 , I7 , I8 , I9 and columns
J1 , J2 , J3 , J4 , J9 and the corresponding form of LP1 with
equality.
S[p1 p2 p3 p4 C] = [0 0 0 0 − 1]

In other words, [pd C d ] is feasible for DLP1. Thus, the objective value of C = C d corresponds to both a dual feasible and
primal feasible solution, which means it is the optimum value
of LP1. Since the optimal schedule given by [p C] has just 4
non-zero states and there are 3 relays, the conjecture is valid
for this case. The case when min{a, b, c} ≥ max{d, e, f } can
be proved in a similar manner by reordering the relays so that
the relay to destination link capacities are in sorted order.
