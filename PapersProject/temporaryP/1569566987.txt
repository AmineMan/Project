and private part. It is the common part of message which
needs to be decoded at the both receivers. Finding capacity
for this simple two user IC is still an open problem, and the
HK scheme is the best known strategy. Recently Etkin, Tse
and Wang considered two user single-input, single-output
(SISO) Gaussian IC, and proposed a scheme (ETW scheme)
which achieves one bit gap to the capacity [3]. The ETW
scheme is a simpler version of the HK scheme with ﬁxed
common-private splitting, but is still shown to be close to the
capacity.
Aforementioned result for two user SISO Gaussian IC
was generalized for two user multiple-input, multiple-output
(MIMO) Gaussian IC in [4], [5], and it was shown that the
ETW-like scheme achieves the constant gap to the capacity.
When there are more than two tranceiver pairs, there are
very few capacity-like results. It is shown that the ETW-like
scheme is generalized DOF (GDOF) optimal for certain
classes of K user MIMO Gaussian IC [6], [7]. In K user
SISO Gaussian IC, signal level alignment is shown to achieve
GDOF of symmetric case. This signal level alignment was
also used to show GDOF result of many-to-one IC [8] and
two user X-channel [9].
Aforementioned capacity-like results are based on schemes
which require coordination of transmitters and/or knowledge
of the interfering channel at each transmitter. Baccelli et al.
investigated capacity of K user SISO Gaussian IC when
there is neither transmitter coordination nor knowledge of
the interfering channel [10]. It can be easily seen that this
strategy is not even GDOF optimal, and hence, it exhibits
inﬁnite gap to the capacity as transmit power goes to inﬁnity.
This implies that the optimal coding scheme for IC could
be signiﬁcantly different from the optimal coding scheme
for p2p channel, and this aspect is explored in [11] to show
that “bad” LDPC codes for p2p channel can be “good”
codes for IC. Nevertheless, performance of JD receiver is
shown to be considerably better than IAN receiver even when
p2p-capacity-achieving codes are used [10].
Motivated by this result, we investigate performances
of “simple” transmission strategies in this paper. We ﬁrst
consider two user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. In this case,
the ETW scheme is already shown to be near-optimal by its
one bit gap to the capacity. Surprisingly, it turns out that
the p2p coding scheme performs better or as nearly good as

Abstract—In this paper, we investigate performances of simple
transmission strategies. We ﬁrst consider two user SISO Gaussian
symmetric interference channel (IC) for which Etkin, Tse and
Wang proposed a scheme (ETW scheme) which achieves one
bit gap to the capacity. We compare performance of point-topoint (p2p) codes with that of the ETW scheme in practical
range of transmitter power. It turns out that p2p coding scheme
performs better or as nearly good as the ETW scheme. Next,
we consider K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. We deﬁne
interference regimes for K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC
and provide closed-form characterization of the symmetric rate
achieved by the p2p scheme and the ETW scheme. Using this
characterization, we evaluate performances of simple strategies
with K=3, and show the similar trend to two user case.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In wireless communication, managing interference has
crucial importance for reliable communication due to its
nature of shared communication medium. Given presence of
interference, a receiver can either treat interference as noise
(IAN receiver) or try to decode interference (joint decoding
receiver) even though it is not ultimately interested in decoding
interference. For an IAN receiver, larger interference would
always result in higher noise ﬂoor, so reducing interference
would be a good transmission strategy. This strategy has
been well adopted in the traditional wireless system design
in the form of orthogonal multiplexing schemes. When a
receiver has multiple dimensions of observation, aligning
interference into sub-dimensions was shown to achieve the
optimal degrees of freedom (DOF) which is strictly greater
than that of orthogonal multiplexing schemes for certain
cases [1]. Still, the focus of the transmission strategy is to
provide interference-free dimension by assuming an IAN
receiver.
Although aforementioned interference-alignment has
brought surprisingly good result with the assumption of an
IAN receiver, it turns out that a receiver needs to decode
interference in some degree if one is interested in the optimal
achievable rate, i.e. capacity. When a receiver is willing
to decode interference, reducing interference or providing
interference-free dimension is not necessarily a good strategy.
Han and Kobayashi looked at this problem more than 30
years ago and proposed well-known Han-Kobayashi (HK)
scheme for two user interference channel (IC) [2]. In the HK
scheme, message of each transmitter is divided into common

range of −1+2P
< a ≤ 1. In strong interference regime,
I(X1 ; Y2 |X2 ) > I(X1 ; Y1 |X2 ) ≥ I(X1 ; Y2 ) holds which
implies that interference-free version of the cross link is better
than interference-free version of the direct link. In Gaussian
channel, this corresponds to the range of 1 < a ≤ 1 + P . In
very strong interference regime, I(X1 ; Y2 ) > I(X1 ; Y1 |X2 )
holds which implies that interference-affected version of the
cross link is better than interference-free version of the direct
link. In Gaussian channel, this corresponds to the range of
a > 1 + P.
As in [10], we deﬁne p2p-capacity-achieving codes as
length n block codes which achieves a rate of R over every p2p Gaussian channel with capacity greater than R as
n → ∞. Note that p2p-capacity-achieving codes excludes the
HK or the ETW schemes. In [10], capacity region with p2pcapacity-achieving codes is characterized. For noisy interference regime, it is given as union of C0 and C1 which are

the ETW scheme. Next, we consider K user SISO Gaussian
symmetric IC. When there are more than two users, the HK
or the ETW scheme is known to be not even GDOF optimal.
Unfortunately, the only capacity-like result for more than two
user case is obtained only for symmetric IC using signal level
alignment as mentioned earlier, and practically implementing
this signal level alignment would be quite challenging.
Therefore, evaluating performance of simple strategies could
have signiﬁcant meaning for practical purpose. In this paper,
we deﬁne interference regimes for K user SISO Gaussian
symmetric IC and provide closed-form characterization of
the symmetric rates achieved by the p2p coding scheme and
by the ETW scheme. Using this characterization, we evaluate
performances of simple strategies with K = 3, and show that
the p2p coding scheme still performs well with respect to the
ETW scheme for practical SNR range.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II,
performance evaluation of simple strategies along with
characterization of the symmetric rate is done for two user
SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. In section III, characterization
of the symmetric rates with the p2p scheme and with the ETW
scheme is done, and performance evaluation is provided for
K user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC. Section IV concludes
the paper. Due to space limitation, all proofs are excluded,
and we refer readers to the full version [12].

A. Interference regimes and achievable region of p2pcapacity-achieving codes
Let us deﬁne two user SISO Gaussian symmetric IC with
channel inputs X1 , X2 and channel outputs Y1 , Y2 as follows.
√
√
Y1 =
P X1 + aP X2 + Z1
(1)
√
√
Y2 =

(2)
where a, P > 0 and Z1 , Z2 ∼ CN (0, 1). Note that
P represents signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and a represents
interference-to-signal ratio (ISR). Because the channel is symmetric, we have
= I(X2 ; Y2 ),

= I(X2 ; Y1 ),

(3c)

I(X1 ; Y2 |X2 )

= I(X2 ; Y1 |X1 ).

(4b)

Note that C0 corresponds to the achievable region of IAN
receiver, and C1 corresponds to the achievable region of
simultaneous decoding receiver which is deﬁned in [13] and
used in [10]. For weak, strong and very strong interference
regimes, the capacity region is equal to C1 , which means
treating interference as noise is meaningful only if interference
is very weak. For very strong interference regime, the sumrate bound in C1 is actually ineffective, i.e. decodability
of intended message without interference is limiting factor
because interference decoding is easy due to strong interfer′
ence, and the capacity region is given as C1 = {(R1 , R2 ) :
R1 < I(X1 ; Y1 |X2 ), R2 < I(X2 ; Y2 |X1 )}. For very strong
interference regime, the capacity of each user is the same
as no interference case. It has also been shown that the
capacity region of p2p-capacity-achieving codes are equal to
the capacity region in strong and very strong interference
regimes [2], [14], [15]. Pictorial explanation of these capacity
regions can be seen in the full version [12].

B. Performance comparison of simple transmission schemes
Let us deﬁne the symmetric rate (Csym ) of a scheme as
Csym = max(R1 ,R2 )∈R min{R1 , R2 }, where R is the achievable region of a scheme. Since p2p-capacity-achieving codes
are known to achieve the capacity region of strong and very
strong interference regimes, we only consider noisy and weak
interference regimes. Achievable region of a “simpler than the
ETW” scheme considered in this section is the union of the
aforementioned capacity region of the p2p-capacity-achieving
codes and the achievable region of a TDMA scheme in which
only one of two users transmit at each time. For convenience,
let us call this uniﬁed scheme as the “p2p scheme”. It is well
known that a TDMA scheme is far from GDOF optimal, and
hence may be thought as a “bad” scheme. Surprisingly, it
will be seen that it is difﬁcult to outperform a TDMA for

For this channel, we would like to deﬁne four interference
regimes according to interference level. In noisy interference
regime, I(X1 ; Y1 ) ≥ I(X1 ; Y2 |X2 ) holds. Roughly speaking,
this implies that interference-affected version of the direct
link (X1 to Y1 ) is better than interference-free version of the
cross link(X1 to Y2 ). In Gaussian channel, noisy interference
√
1+4P
regime corresponds to the range of a ≤ −1+2P
. In
weak interference regime, I(X1 ; Y1 |X2 ) ≥ I(X1 ; Y2 |X2 ) >
I(X1 ; Y1 ) holds which implies that interference-free version
of the direct link is better than interference-free version of
the cross link. In Gaussian channel, this corresponds to the

practical SNR range in noisy and weak interference regimes.
For simplicity, performance comparison will be done in terms
of the symmetric rate. Since the TDMA scheme achieves the
symmetric rate of 1 log2 (1 + 2P ) regardless of interference

regime, it is easy to see that the symmetric rate of the p2p
scheme is given as follows.

It can be easily veriﬁed that f (a1 ) < 0 when P = 100
which implies that P ′ ≥ 100. Thus, we have the following

Note that the above symmetric rate is obtained by sub-optimal
decoding in which common messages are jointly decoded with
treating private messages as noise, and a private message is
decoded given decoded common messages as explained in [3].
As pointed out in [2], [16], jointly decoding all messages at
the same time can be better than this sub-optimal decoding. It
turns out that the aforementioned sub-optimal decoding is no
different from joint decoding in terms of the symmetric rate,
and it is pointed out in Remark 4 of [2]. From now on we

call the symmetric rate of the ETW scheme as Csym . Now
let us state the result for noisy interference regime.

when SNR≤ 30 dB.
Results obtained in this section imply that the ETW scheme
performs closely to or is outperformed by the p2p scheme
when SNR≤ 30 dB. This is surprising given the fact that
the ETW scheme is known to be near-optimal, and implies
that more complicated message splitting is possibly needed in
order to signiﬁcantly outperform the p2p scheme. Although
there are several ways to justify the choice of simple message
splitting used in the ETW scheme as discussed in [3], it
was also pointed out in [3] that this could very well be
sub-optimal. One intuition of simple message splitting can
be obtained from deterministic modeling [17], [18] in which
private information is assigned for the level under noise ﬂoor
to achieve the capacity. In deterministic modeling, this choice
is straightforward because no information is delivered under
noise ﬂoor, but it is not necessarily the case with Gaussian
IC due to randomness of noise. The effort of ﬁnding better
message splitting was given in [19], and certain value of a
was found for which a version of the HK scheme performs
better than the p2p scheme.

Theorem 1 implies that IAN decoding with p2p codes
performs better than the ETW scheme in noisy interference
regime. Similar phenomenon can be seen in [3] in terms of
GDOF although characterization of interference regimes in this
paper is slightly different from that in [3].
Let us see how these two schemes compares in weak
interference regime. Deﬁne

where a, P > 0 and Zi ∼ CN (0, 1). As mentioned earlier,
signal level alignment is shown to achieve GDOF of this
channel, and HK-like scheme would be sub-optimal. This
is because of violation of “interference decodability” in this
channel, which can be easily understood via deterministic
modeling [6], [17]. Nevertheless, investigating performances
of simple strategies still can be meaningful given the fact that
these are considerably easier to implement.
Suppose there is no coordination among transmitters and no
message splitting at each transmitter. As in two user case, we
are interested in the symmetric rate as a performance metric.
To ﬁnd the symmetric rate, we need to evaluate achievable
region of this scheme. Consider now the capacity region C
of Gaussian-p2p codes deﬁned in equation (1) of [10]. As
seen in [10], however, C cannot be thought as the capacity
region of p2p-capacity-achieving codes since it is possible to
gain beneﬁt even without message splitting by coordination in
K user case. This is why MAC-capacity-achieving codes are
deﬁned in [10], and it turns out that C is the capacity region
with MAC-capacity-achieving codes. Simply speaking, C can
be thought as the capacity region with no coordination among
transmitters and no message splitting at each transmitter which
we are interested in, and we will call this region as capacity
region of Gaussian-p2p codes.
Due to symmetry, the symmetric rate is obtained by evaluation on one receiver. Let us consider receiver 1. Let S be some
subset of {2, ..., K}, and let XS be the vector of transmitted
signals Xi such that i ∈ S, and RS be the corresponding
˜ p2p
vector of rates. Then, the symmetric rate Csym with Gaussianp2p codes is given as

the symmetric rate of the ETW scheme with sub-optimal

ETW scheme for two user case is not characterized for strong
interference regime in [3] because the p2p scheme achieves
the capacity. In K user case, however, this is not the case.

We now deﬁne four interference regimes for
this channel. Noisy interference regime satisﬁes

regime satisﬁes I(X1 ; Y1 ) ≤ K I(X1 , ..., XK ; Y1 ) and

I(X1 ; Y1 |X2 , ..., XK ). Note that we know the capacity for
very strong interference regime.
We can characterize the symmetric rate of Gaussian-p2p
codes for each regime.

due to space limitation, we can also characterize interference
regimes and the sum rate of simple schemes for two user
asymmetric case as can be seen in the full version [12] which
possibly provides more insights for interference channel.
Performance of the p2p scheme in MIMO IC was investigated in [20] where the transmit signal covariance optimization
is performed. It would be interesting to compare performance
of this p2p scheme with that of GDOF optimal schemes in [4],
[5].

As in Section II, we would like to compare performances
of the p2p scheme and the ETW scheme for weak interference
regime. Unfortunately, complete analysis like in Section II is
extremely difﬁcult for more than two users. Because of that,
we will restrict our attention to K = 3 with the approximated
symmetric rate. Let us deﬁne the approximated symmetric

Basically, ‘+1’ term inside log expression is dropped for all,

Csym is replaced with (K − 1)(P − 1/a) which is larger
than original. Hence, we may think this as an ETW-favoring
approximation. We now compare performances in terms of
these approximated symmetric rates.

The above result shows that the trend is similar to two
user case even with more than two users, although the result
obtained here is weaker and more limited due to analytical
difﬁculty. Note that the p2p scheme is not shown to achieve
the capacity for strong interference regime unlike two user
case. Hence, it would be worthwhile to compare performances
in this regime, but we expect to see similar trend to two user
case.
IV. C ONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we investigated performances of simple transmission schemes for interference channel. It turns out that very
simple transmission scheme even without message splitting
can be quite good. Although the TDMA scheme is mainly
compared with the ETW scheme for weak interference regime,
we should note that this was because the p2p scheme is already
known to be capacity achieving for strong and very strong
interference regimes with two users. In other words, it is
important to have the receiver structure which is capable of
decoding multiple messages for strong interference, but simple
change in scheduling could be good enough at the transmitter.
Although only symmetric cases are considered in this paper
