The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. A
formal deﬁnition of the rate region of the vector Gaussian
L-terminal CEO problem is given in Section II. In Section
III we derive an outer bound of the rate region of the vector
Gaussian CEO problem by establishing a lower bound on each
supporting hyperplane of the rate region; furthermore, it is
shown that the outer bound coincides with the Berger-Tung
inner bound in the high-resolution regime. A new extremal
inequality, which is the main technical ingredient in the derivation of the outer bound for the vector Gaussian CEO problem,
is given in Section V; the proof of this extremal inequality
relies on the connection between differential entropy and
Fisher information as well as some fundamental estimationtheoretic inequalities. Section VI concludes the paper.
Throughout this paper, for any random object W and m× n
1
random matrix X we deﬁne ΣX = n E[XXT ] and ΣX|W =
ΣX−E[X|W ] ; we assume the logarithm function is to base e
and deﬁne log+ x = max(log x, 0).

Abstract—We derive an outer bound of the rate region of
the vector Gaussian L-terminal CEO problem by establishing a
lower bound on each supporting hyperplane of the rate region.
To this end we prove a new extremal inequality by exploiting the
connection between differential entropy and Fisher information
as well as some fundamental estimation-theoretic inequalities. It
is shown that the outer bound matches the Berger-Tung inner
bound in the high-resolution regime.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The CEO problem, also known as the indirect multiterminal
source coding problem, was introduced by Berger, Zhang, and
Viswanathan in [1]. A series of papers were devoted to the
scalar Gaussian version of the problem [2]–[4], culminating
in a complete characterization of the rate region by Oohama
[5] and Prabhakaran et al. [6] (see also [7] for the solution
to a generalized version of this problem). However, the proof
technique in [5], [6] is not completely suitable for the vector
Gaussian case due to its heavy reliance on the entropy power
inequality. The reason is that the proportionality condition
(on the relevant covariance matrices) for the tightness of the
entropy power inequality is not necessarily satisﬁed in the
vector source setting, though this technical issue can sometimes be resolved by invoking the entropy power inequality
in conjunction with an enhancement argument [8] (see, e.g.,
[9] for bounding the sum rate of the vector Gaussian CEO
problem via this approach).
A new approach to the Gaussian CEO problem was proposed in [10], which is directly applicable to the vector case
due to its estimation-theoretic nature. However, this approach
is only effective for bounding the sum rate part of the rate
region. In order to treat a general supporting hyperplane
of the rate region, one has to resolve the tension among
various information-theoretic quantities, which calls for a
certain extremal inequality. It turns out that in the two-terminal
case [11], [12] the desired extremal inequality is essentially
a strengthened version of the Liu-Viswanath inequality [13].
Unfortunately, to handle the general L-terminal case, one has
to deal with a certain long Markov chain structure and the
extremal inequality needed for that purpose is signiﬁcantly
different from the Liu-Viswanath inequality and its variants
(see, e.g., [14], [15]). Among other contributions of this paper,
we prove such an extremal inequality for the general vector
Gaussian L-terminal CEO problem, which yields an outer
bound of the rate region.

II. P ROBLEM D EFINITION
Let X0 , N1 , · · · , NL be mutually independent m × 1 Gaussian random vectors with mean zero and positive deﬁnite
covariance matrices ΣX0 , ΣN1 , · · · , ΣNL , respectively. Let
Xi = X0 + Ni , i = 1, · · · , L. We refer to X0 as the
remote source and Xi as the noisy observation at Encoder
i, i = 1, · · · , L.
Let {(X0 (t), N1 (t), · · · , NL (t), X1 (t), · · · , XL (t))}∞ be
t=1
i.i.d. copies of (X0 , N1 , · · · , NL , X1 , · · · , XL ). The rate
region of the vector Gaussian L-terminal CEO problem is
deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 1: A rate vector (R1 , · · · , RL ) is said to be
achievable subject to distortion constraint D if for all sufﬁ(n)
ciently large n, there exist encoding functions fi : Rm×n →
{1, · · · , Ki }, i = 1, · · · , L, and decoding function g (n) :

set of all achievable rate vectors subject to distortion constraint

Remark: Clearly, there is no loss of optimality in assuming
g (n) (W1 , · · · , WL ) = E[Xn |W1 , · · · , WL ]. Therefore, R(D)

is not affected if we replace (1) with ΣXn |W1 ,··· ,WL D.

Since R(D) is a (closed) convex set, it sufﬁces to characterize its supporting hyperplanes, i.e., to solve the following
optimization problem

One can readily obtain the following upper bound on
R(D, α) by evaluating the standard Berger-Tung inner bound
[16], [17]. This result is a straightforward generalization of
[12, Theorem 3] from the two-terminal case to the L-terminal
case. The proof is omitted.

It is easy to show that R(D, α) = R(D, α) in the scalar
case (i.e., m = 1), which recovers the well-known result in
[5], [6]. The following result provides a simple and explicit
matching condition for the vector case.

The following theorem, which is a generalization of [12,
Theorem 2] from the two-terminal case to the L-terminal case,
provides a lower bound on R(D, α). The proof of this result
relies on the extremal inequality (i.e., Theorem 5) in Section

VI. C ONCLUSION
A new extremal inequality is established and is leveraged
to derive an outer bound of the rate region of the vector
Gaussian CEO problem. Furthermore, it is shown that this
outer bound coincides with the Berger-Tung inner bound in
the high-resolution regime.
It is now well understood that indirect Gaussian multiterminal source coding is intimately connected with its direct
coding counterpart [10], [20]–[22]. In fact, the direct vector
Gaussian multiterminal source coding problem can be viewed
as a limiting version of the vector Gaussian CEO problem. By
exploiting this connection, one can readily translate the results
in the present work to the direct Gaussian multiterminal source
coding setting [23].
