Throughput Penalty of Fair Scheduling Algorithms
on Multiple Antenna Broadcast Channels

In a non-cooperative approach, Marzetta proposed a scheme
of so called massive MIMO, which involves the installation
of a large number of antennas at base stations to increase
the spectral efﬁciency [3]. This is a promising technique but
the problems of pilot contamination [4] and the physical
installation of massive antennas remain unresolved. These
technical challenges have become so widespread that innovative unconventional systems are now being actively studied.
However, the analysis of such systems is too complicated to
draw any fundamental conclusions. Additionally, since many
existing systems are based on the SCP (single-cell processing)
operation, it may be useful to investigate them in terms of SCP.
Using a simple SCP model, this paper investigates the price
of fairness in terms of the system throughput loss and seeks
fundamental insights into the system parameters of fairness
and system throughput. In a MIMO broadcast channel, [5]
studies an iterative approach to obtain the maximum sum
rate and [6] analyzes the sum-rate offset by different transmit
strategies including dirty paper coding and zero-forcing/block
diagonalization. Reference [7] develops the max-min fair algorithm and investigates the fairness penalty but the analysis is
limited to two-user case in [7]. The capacity region of MIMO
broadcast channels is completely characterized in [8] but the
details of each boundary point has yet to be understood in
terms of throughput and fairness. To provide insights on the
relationship of throughput and fairness, this paper analyzes
the throughput penalty of boundary fair points for MIMO
broadcast channels, in which the max-min fairness and the
max-product fairness points on the boundary are considered.
In this paper, we calculate the sum-rate differences for the
max-sum, the max-product, and the max-min optimal points
on the capacity region boundary and analyze their asymptotic
behaviors at high SNR. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne the fairness
penalty as the sum-rate difference between the achievable sum
rate and the max-min fair rate, and derive it as the logarithmic
ratio of the geometric mean and the harmonic mean of the
beam vectors. By using the random matrix theory, we analyze
the fairness penalty, both when the users have the same average
SNR values and when the users have different SNR values
as well. Interestingly, it is shown for the homogeneous case
that the fairness penalty is negligible when the number of
transmit antennas is large. This result suggests that optimizing
the system for fairness does not penalize the total throughput
under certain conditions.

Abstract—Fairness consideration in the wireless resource
scheduling is important for enhancing the quality of user experience, despite the consequent throughput loss. This paper analyzes
the associated penalty in obtaining a certain fairness criteria
for multiple antenna broadcast channels. We deﬁne a fairness
penalty as the achievable sum-rate difference in the regime of
high SNR. We show that the penalty for the max-product fair
scheduling criterion is negligible and derive the penalty for the
max-min fair scheduling criterion. We analyze ergodic behaviors
for the Rayleigh-fading channel both when the average SNRs are
homogeneous (identical) and when the SNRs are heterogeneous
(different). For the homogeneous case, it is shown that the penalty
diminishes as the number of transmit antennas increases. For
the heterogeneous case, there is an inevitable bias term which is
associated with the users’ SNR distribution.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Two fundamental facets of performance measures are
throughput and fairness. The throughput measure is a useful
metric that optimizes the system resources in the system
perspective so that the total sum rate is to be maximized.
This may result in non-uniform allocation among users, e.g.,
scheduling more power to the better channel users without
considering fairness among users. Although there are many
deﬁnitions of fairness, it generally means the consideration of
each individual user so that the system resources are optimized
from the perspective of that user. In this paper we investigate
the penalty, in terms of the system throughput, to obtain (or
maintain) fairness among users and see how the resulting
penalty behaves, depending on the system parameters for
multiple antenna broadcast channels.
Due to the recent explosive use of smart phones, many
efforts are being taken to increase the spectral efﬁciency, cooperatively among base stations and non-cooperatively as well.
Base station cooperation allows for the intelligent handling of
inter-cell interference, the major predicament of contemporary
mobile communication systems. As a practical example, the
3GPP Standardization Body is working on CoMP (coordinated
multi-point transmission), which is a multi-cell processing
technique to improve the cell-edge users’ performance by
controlling interference, for the LTE-Advanced system [1].
However, the price for base station cooperation involves the
resolution of backhaul issues [2] (and references therein).

If we schedule with the intent to achieve throughput maximization, the users with poor channel quality will be sacriﬁced,
resulting in an unfair allocation. This section deals with such
unfairness issues among users by considering the allocation
of resources with fairness criteria such as max-min and maxproduct scheduling.

It is well known that dirty paper coding (DPC) achieves the
capacity region of MIMO broadcast channel [8]. The boundary
of the capacity region can be characterized by the weighted
sum-rate maximization [7]:
(2)

A. Max-min Fairness

where µ = [µ1 µ2 · · · µK ] is the weight vector, R =
[R1 R2 · · · RK ]T is the rate vector, and C(H, P ) is the
capacity region of the broadcast channel. Optimization (2)
ﬁnds the point on the boundary of the capacity region where
the tangent to the capacity region is deﬁned by the weight
vector. Figure 1 illustrates the characterization of the capacity
region boundary in terms of the weight vector for a two-user
case. By solving all possible µ1 and µ2 satisfying µ1 +µ2 = 1,
the entire boundary of the capacity region can be traced out
[9].
Because of unwieldy complexity, this paper considers a simpler scheme with the zero-forcing beamforming [10], which
will provide a more straightforward analysis and, moreover,
can result in a practical implementation. The performance gap
due to the zero-forcing beamforming instead of DPC will be
presented in [11]. We denote the achievable region by zeroforcing beamforming CZF (H, P ), whose boundary is similarly
traced out by solving the weighted sum-rate optimization.
To calculate the achievable rate by zero-forcing beamforming, we deﬁne gk as the orthogonal projection of hk onto the
null space spanned by {hl }l6=k [10]:

One of the simplest fairness strategies is to maximize the
minimum of all user rates [7]:
C sym (H, P ) =

max

min(R1 , . . . , RK ).

R2C(H,P )

(7)

Here, we denote the resulting rate as C sym since the optimal
point is determined at the supremum of symmetric rates, i.e.,
the boundary point on the capacity region intersecting with the
line deﬁned by R1 = R2 = · · · = RK . Notice that this maxmin fair rate C sym is the maximization of the worst-user’s rate
with all the users operating at the same rate, thereby ensuring
a maximum fair rate.
Unlike the sum-rate maximization optimization, the weight
vector corresponding to C sym depends on the channel realization and the power. With the function in (2), the max-min
achievable rate can be also found by [7]:

which solves for the proportional fair scheduling [13][14].
Speciﬁcally, following the general idea in [13], a proportionalfair scheduler for the MIMO broadcast channel was formulated
in [15] assuming that the DPC technique is exploited at the
transmitter.
Although we cannot obtain the close-form solution to (10),
we can ﬁnd the optimal point iteratively with the weighted
sum-rate maximization [9]. The same argument holds for
zero-forcing beamforming, in which rate vectors and the sum
prod
rate are denoted by Rprod and CZF , respectively. Since the
ZF
optimization is convex, we can use the ﬁxed point iteration in
Algorithm 1.
Figure 2 illustrates the achievable zero-forcing sum rates for
different optimizations when M = 5 and K = 5. As can be
seen, the max sum-rate optimization achieves the highest sum
throughput while the max-min fairness optimization achieves
the lowest sum throughput. Moreover, the rate gap between
the twos seems to remain constant especially when P is large.
This will be referred to as the fairness penalty and further
analyzed in the next section. There is one interesting fact about
the behavior of the product maximization which is illustrated
in the dotted curve marked with triangles in the ﬁgure. As P
increases, the achievable sum rate of the product maximization
converges to that of the sum-rate maximization. We also prove
this theoretically with:

Proof: See [11].
The theorem implies that the throughput loss due to the maxproduct fairness criterion is minuscule in the regime of high
SNR.
V. T HROUGHPUT P ENALTY A NALYSIS AT H IGH SNR

This section investigates the sum-rate loss to maintain the
max-min fairness in high SNR environment. Since the penalty
is negligible for the max-product fair criterion according to
Theorem 2, this analysis is focused on max-min fairness. After
deﬁning the fairness penalty as the throughput loss from the
max-sum rate to the max-min rate, we calculate the penalty
for instantaneous channel realizations. Under the Rayleighfading channel assumption, we investigate the fairness for
homogenous average SNR users and then for heterogeneous
SNR users.

k=1
those of a continuous random variable, e.g., G[X] and H[X],
respectively, where X is a random variable having the same
distribution with kgk k2 . More generally, we assume that every
kgk k2 has 2 -distribution with 2L degrees of freedom. Then
the fairness penalty becomes:
Theorem 6: If kgk k2 has 2 -distribution with 2L degrees
of freedom and there are innumerable users, then

(17)

This represents the rate penalty per user between the maximum
sum
throughput scheduling CZF (H, P ) and the maximum fair
sym
scheduling CZF (H, P ).
From (6) and (9), we can immediately obtain the fairness
penalty as:

Thus far we have assumed that the average strength of
channel gains is the same for all users. However, it is
more likely that users will have different SNR values due
to variations in the wireless environment; e.g., near-far and
interference effects. In this circumstance, pursuing fairness
would be expected to be quite different from the throughput
optimization. We consider this unequal average SNR effect on
the fairness penalty in this subsection.
We assume that the channel gain of each user can be
decomposed into
p ˜
hk =
k = 1, . . . , K,
(22)
k hk ,

We now consider the homogenous SNR case, i.e., all the
users have the same average SNR. Moreover, we assume the
standard i.i.d. Rayleigh fading distribution, where the entries
of hk are i.i.d. complex Gaussian with unit variance.
With the help of random matrix theory [16], we can derive
the ergodic behavior of the fairness penalty as:

where k denotes the average SNR of user k. The elements of
˜
hk are complex Gaussian with zero mean and unit variance.
Unlike the homogeneous SNR case, it is difﬁcult to obtain a
closed-form analytical expression for the heterogeneous SNR
case due to various users’ distribution scenarios. Consequently,
the average SNR distribution does not lend itself to quantiﬁcation. Instead, we investigate the fairness penalty analysis
numerically. Since we deﬁne the fairness penalty at high SNR,
i.e., P ! 1 in (17), we call the penalty at ﬁnite SNR the sum
rate difference in this subsection.
Figure 3 shows the sum rate differences for three sets of
different average SNRs. The top three solid curves illustrate
the sum rate differences when the average SNR for the ﬁrst
user is 0.01, that of the second user is 1, and that of the third
user is 100. Among the top three solid curves, the lowest
curve (circles) is for M = 3, K = 3, the middle curve
(triangles) is for M = 10, K = 3, and the upper curve
(squares) is for M = 100, K = 3. By the same token, the
second three dotted curves illustrate the sum rate differences
for 1 = 0.1, 2 = 1, 3 = 10. The lowest three dashed curve
illustrate the difference for 1 = 2 = 3 = 1, similarly. As
can be seen, there is a constant bias in the sum rate difference
when the average SNR ’s are different. Furthermore, the sum
rate difference is large when the variance in the average SNRs
is large. Additionally, we can see that the sum rate differences
converge as P increases and the convergence rate increases as
M grows.
1) Two-user case (K = 2): Due to the complication of the
users’ distribution, the fairness penalty analysis needs to rely
on the numerical results for the heterogeneous average SNR

(19)

where (·) is the Euler’s digamma function and E denotes the
expectation operator.
Proof: See [11].
Moreover, the fairness penalty becomes negligible when the
number of transmit antennas is large:
Theorem 5: The expected fairness penalty diminishes as M
grows, i.e.,
lim E[ ZF (H)] = 0
(20)
M !1

Proof: See [11].
This implies that pursuing fairness does not sacriﬁce the sumrate performance where the number of transmit antennas is
large. It should be noted that the optimal power allocation
strategies for the max-sum criterion and the max-min criterion are not necessarily the same but the resulting rate gap
diminishes for large transmit antennas. Notice also that this
result only applies for the homogeneous average SNR users.
When the users have different average SNR values, the fairness
penalty is not negligible no matter how many antennas are
installed at the transmitter (as will be discussed in the next
subsection).
For another extreme situation, we consider the case of a
large number of users by assuming that there are a sufﬁciently
large number of transmit antennas so that dimensionality is
not a factor. In this case, we may substitute the geometric

This implies that these fairness scheduling algorithms do not

fairness among users so that the quality of user experience can
be enhanced. When the average SNRs are different among
users, however, there is a constant bias term in the fairness
penalty, which cannot be compensated for by increasing the
number of transmit antennas. The goal of the analysis provided
herein is to provide insight into the tradeoff of throughput
against fairness, thereby allowing for the determination of the
applicability of fair schedulers to enhance the quality of the
user experience.

Notice that p
the second additive term in (24), i.e.,
log2 ((1 + ↵)/2 ↵), serves as a constant bias. Since this bias
term is solely determined by the heterogeneity of the different
SNR values, this bias is inevitable. Notice also that this term is
increasing with respect to ↵ for ↵ > 1, which implies that the
fairness penalty grows as the SNR unbalance increases. Since
the two additive terms are always non-negative and the second
term is monotonically increasing, the fairness penalty can be
considerable despite the application of massive antennas at the
transmitter. This trend is captured in Table I, which shows the
ergodic fairness penalty for heterogeneous two-user Rayleigh
fading channels.
VI. C ONCLUSION
We have investigated the throughput penalty for the maxproduct and max-min fair scheduling algorithms. At high SNR,
we showed that the penalty is negligible for the max-product
fair scheduler. We also showed that the penalty of the max-min
fair scheduler decreases as the number of transmit antennas
increases when all the users have the same average SNR value.
