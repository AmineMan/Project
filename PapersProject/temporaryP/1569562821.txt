behavior was shown to be determined by three transmission
parameters: the input alphabet X, its input distribution P, and
its binary labeling L. First-order optimal (FOO) constellations
were deﬁned as the triplet [X, P, L] that make a BICM system
achieve the SL. The optimality analysis in [15], however, only
considers uniform input distributions. Probabilistic shaping
for BICM was considered in [9], [16]–[18]. Recently, the
ﬁrst-order equivalence between some uniform and nonuniform
constellations for BICM was numerically studied in [19].
The main contribution of this paper is to generalize the
results of [15] to nonuniform input distributions using the
equivalence in [19]. A complete characterization of FOO
constellations for BICM in terms of [X, P, L] is obtained. In
particular, we ﬁnd the geometrical and/or probabilistic shaping
rules that should be applied to a constellation to make it FOO.
We conclude that for BICM systems in the wideband regime,
probabilistic shaping offers no extra degrees of freedom in
addition to what is provided by geometrical shaping.

Abstract—Probabilistic shaping for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
investigated. Using known results for BICM systems with a
uniform input distribution, the combinations of input alphabet,
input distribution, and binary labeling that achieve the Shannon
limit –1.59 dB are fully characterized. It is found that a BICM
system achieves the Shannon limit at low SNR if and only if it can
be represented as a zero-mean linear projection of a hypercube,
which is the same condition as for uniform input distributions.
Hence, probabilistic shaping offers no extra degrees of freedom
to optimize the low-SNR regime of BICM systems, in addition
to what is provided by geometrical shaping.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The most important breakthrough for coded modulation
(CM) in fading channels came in 1992, when Zehavi introduced the so-called bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM)
in [1], usually referred to as a pragmatic approach for CM
[2], [3]. Despite not being fully understood theoretically,
BICM has been rapidly adopted in commercial systems such
as wireless and wired broadband access networks, 3G/4G
telephony, and digital video broadcasting, making it as the
de facto standard for current telecommunications systems.
Signal shaping [4], [5] refers to the use of non-equally
spaced and/or non-equally likely symbols, i.e., geometrical
shaping and probabilistic shaping. In the context of BICM,
geometrical shaping for BICM was proposed in [6]–[8] and
probabilistic shaping in [9].
For the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel,
the Shannon Limit (SL) −1.59 dB represents the average bit
energy to noise-ratio needed to transmit information reliably
when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to zero [10], [11].
The SL is fully determined by the ﬁrst derivative of the mutual
information (MI) function at zero SNR [10, Sec I] [11, eq. (1)].
When discrete alphabets are used with a BICM receiver,
the SL is not always achieved [12]. This was shown in [13]
to be caused by the selection of the binary labeling. The
performance of BICM at low SNR, i.e., in the wideband
regime, was studied in [12]–[14]. In [15], the wideband

Throughout this paper all MIs are given in bits. Vectors
are row vectors x and matrices are denoted by X. The inner
product between two vectors a and b is denoted by a, b . The
Euclidean norm of the vector a is denoted by a . Random
variables are denoted by capital letters X and random vectors
by boldface capital letters X. The probability density function
(pdf) of the random vector Y is denoted by pY (y) and the
conditional pdf by pY |X (y|x). A similar notation applies
to probability mass functions (pmf) of a random variable,
which we denote by PY (y) and PY |X (y|x). Expectations

B. System Model
We consider transmissions over a discrete-time memoryless
AWGN channel. The received vector at any discrete time
instant is Y = X + Z, where X is the real-valued channel
input and Z is a real Gaussian noise with zero mean and
variance N0 /2 in each dimension. The conditional transition

for i = 0, . . . , M − 1 and for some [PC0 (0), . . . , PCm−1 (0)].
Since PCk (1) = 1−PCk (0), the distribution P is fully speciﬁed
by the set of bit probabilities [PC0 (0), . . . , PCm−1 (0)]. An
important special case is the uniform distribution, for which
PCk (0) = 1/2 for k = 0, . . . , m − 1 and P = Um
[1/M, . . . , 1/M ]T .
Throughout this paper, we assume that 0 < PCk (0) < 1 for
all k = 0, . . . , m − 1, i.e., we assume that all constellation
points are used with a nonzero probability. If that was not the
case, the cardinality of the constellation should be reduced.
Hence Pi > 0 for i = 0, . . . , M − 1.

The SNR is deﬁned as snr
Es /N0 = Rc Eb /N0 , where
Es
EX [ X 2 ] is the average symbol energy, Rc is the
transmission rate in information bits per symbol, and Eb is
the average energy per information bit.
We consider the generic BICM scheme in Fig. 1. In the simplest case, a binary encoder is concatenated with a memoryless
modulator Φ via a bit-level interleaver. Multiple encoders
and/or interleavers may be used to obtain probabilistic shaping.
At the receiver, using the channel output Y , the demapper Φ−1
computes metrics Lk for the individual coded bits Ck with
k = 0, . . . , m−1, usually in the form of logarithmic likelihood
ratios. These metrics are then passed to the deinterleaver(s) and
decoder(s) to obtain an estimate of the information bits.
The mapper Φ is deﬁned via the input alphabet X =
[xT , . . . , xT ]T ∈ RM×N , where m bits are used to index
0
M−1
the symbols vectors xi ∈ RN for i = 0, . . . , M − 1,
M = 2m . We associate with each symbol xi a binary m-tuple
(codeword) ci
[ci,0 , . . . , ci,m−1 ] ∈ B m and the probability
0 ≤ Pi ≤ 1, where Pi
PX (xi ). The binary labeling is
denoted by L = [cT , . . . , cT ]T ∈ B M×m and the input
0
M−1
distribution by P = [P0 , . . . , PM−1 ]T ∈ [0, 1]M .
For any constellation [X, P, L], a set of equivalent constellations can be constructed by simultaneously permuting the
rows of X, L, and P. Speciﬁcally, it is possible to permute
the rows of any labeling matrix L such that any other labeling
is obtained. Without loss of generality, we therefore ﬁx the
labeling to be the natural binary code (NBC) from now on,
deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 1 (Natural binary code): The NBC is the binary
labeling Nm
[n(0)T , . . . , n(M − 1)T ]T , where n(i) =
[ni,0 , . . . , ni,m−1 ] ∈ B m denotes the base-2 representation of
the integer 0 ≤ i ≤ M − 1, with ni,m−1 being the most
signiﬁcant bit.
Based on the previous discussion, from now on we use
the name constellation to denote the pair [X, P], where the
NBC labeling is implicit. Assuming independent, but possibly
nonuniformly distributed, bits C0 , . . . , Cm−1 at the input of
the modulator, the symbol probabilities are given by [15, eq.
(30)] [9, eq. (8)]

In what follows, we derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a BICM system, with an arbitrary input alphabet and

next two theorems, which are omitted due to space limitations,
rely on a linear transform introduced in [19]. We refer the
reader to [22] for them.

optimal constellations in terms of the BICM-GMI at low SNR.
The following deﬁnition formally deﬁnes BICM systems that
achieve the SL.
Deﬁnition 5 (FOO constellation): The constellation [X, P]

B. Low-SNR parameters for Uniform Distributions
The low-SNR parameters [µ, Es , α] have been analyzed in
detail for arbitrary input alphabets X under the assumption of
uniform probabilities [15]. Under this assumption, they can be
˜
expressed as functions of the HT of the alphabet X as shown
in the following theorem.
Theorem 1: For a constellation [X, Um ], the low-SNR parameters are

Proof: Expressions (13) and (14) follow from Deﬁnition
4, while (15) can be obtained using [15, Theorem 10] plus
some algebra. For a detailed proof, we refer the reader to [22,
Theorem 6].
Theorem 2 shows that the low-SNR parameters depend on
the input alphabet X, the binary labeling (via ni,k in the
expression for α), and the input distribution (via PCk (u) and
Pi ).

It can be shown that for asymptotically low SNR, i.e., in the

reliable transmission is lower-bounded by Eb /N0 ≥ 1/α ≥

Martinez et al. [21] recognized the BICM decoder in Fig. 1
as a mismatched decoder and showed that the BICM-GMI in
(9) corresponds to an achievable rate of such a decoder. This
means that reliable transmission using a BICM system at rate
Rc is possible if Rc < I (snr).
Deﬁnition 4 (Low-SNR parameters): The low-SNR parameters of a constellation [X, P] are deﬁned as [µ, Es , α], where

Proof: The expressions in (10) are obtained from Deﬁnition 4 and (5), the ones in (11) from from Deﬁnition 4 and
[15, eq. (16)], and the ones in (12) from [15, eq. (50)] and
[15, Theorem 11].

Note that only (16) depends on the input distribution, not
(17). In view of [15, Theorem 12], the only difference between
FOO constellations with uniform and nonuniform distributions
˜
lie in x0 . The ﬁnal theorem gives this statement a more
intuitive interpretation.

For certain distributions, the mean (21) is zero. Speciﬁcally,
µ = 0 if and only if
PC0 (0) = PC2 (0) = PC1 (0)/2 + 1/4.

(22)

Clearly, the uniform case (PC0 (0) = PC1 (0) = PC2 (0) =
1/2) analyzed in [15] fulﬁlls (22). When any other set of
bit probabilities fulﬁlling (22) is used, the resulting constellation will be FOO. This is the case for instance if
[PC0 (0), PC1 (0), PC2 (0)] = [0.3, 0.1, 0.3] which induces via
(2) an input distribution denoted by P1 . The obtained constellation [XOTTO , P1 ] is illustrated in Fig. 2 with ﬁlled
circles, where the area of the circles is proportional to the
corresponding symbol probabilities.
Input distributions do not generally fulﬁll (22). For example, the set of probabilities [PC0 (0), PC1 (0), PC2 (0)] =
[0.2, 0.3, 0.8] gives an input distribution P2 for which the mean
(21) is µ = [−0.4, −1.2]. We deﬁne a new alphabet XOTTO
by subtracting µ from each element in XOTTO . The translated
constellation [XOTTO , P2 ], shown in Fig. 2, is a zero-mean
projected hypercube and thus FOO according to Theorem 4.
In Fig. 3, we show the BICM-GMI for the zero-mean
constellations [XOTTO , P1 ] and [XOTTO , P2 ] in Fig. 2 as well
as for the constellation [XOTTO , U3 ] in [15, Fig. 4 (a)]. As
expected, all the MI curves converge at the SL for low SNR.

B. Numerical Examples
In this section we give numerical examples to illustrate the
analytical results presented in this paper.

here called OTTO (one-three-three-one), which corresponds to
a projected hypercube. This alphabet is

The constellation [XOTTO , U3 ] was shown to be FOO in [15,
Example 4].
In this example, we are interested in the ﬁrst-order behavior
of the constellation [XOTTO , P] for different P. In view of
Theorem 4, this constellation will be FOO if it has zero mean.
Using (20) and (2) in (13), we ﬁnd (after some algebra) that

Based on [15, Theorem 12], the result in Theorem 4 can
be understood as follows. If a constellation with a uniform
input distribution is FOO, it will still be FOO for any other
input distribution PC0 (0), . . . , PCm−1 (0) provided that the
input alphabet is translated to be zero mean. The result in
Theorem 4 also states that a constellation is FOO if and only
if its input alphabet is a linear projection of a hypercube and
it has zero mean. This behavior is illustrated in Example 1
and also in [15, Fig. 4].
We also note that the zero-mean condition in Theorem 4
is the same that guarantees FOO for the coded modulation
MI (CM-MI) [15, Footnote 12]1 . This implies that the only
difference between FOO constellations for the CM-MI and the
BICM-GMI lies on the extra constraint on the input alphabet
to be a linear projection of a hypercube.

Fig. 4. The BICM-GMI for a Gray-labeled 8-PAM alphabet XPAM with
uniform input distribution and bit probabilities [PC0 (0), PC1 (0), PC2 (0)] =
[0.5, p, p] for different values of p. The constellations approach a binary FOO
constellation as p → 0. The NBC-labeled 8-PAM constellation [XPAM , U3 ],
although FOO, is considerably weaker than XPAM for a wide range of SNRs.

The exempliﬁed method holds in full generality: Any alphabet that is FOO with a uniform input distribution is FOO also
with an arbitrary nonuniform distribution, if it is translated to
zero mean. Furthermore, all nonuniform FOO constellations
can be constructed in this manner.
Example 2: M -ary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) alphabets have been shown to be FOO if the NBC is used with
a uniform input distribution, i.e, the constellation [XPAM , Um ]
with XPAM = [−(M − 1), −(M − 3), . . . , M − 1] is FOO
[13] [15, Theorem 14]. In this example, we study the ﬁrstorder behavior of the Gray-labeled 8-PAM alphabet XPAM =
[−7, 7, −1, 1, −5, 5, −3, 3]. The constellation [XPAM , P] is
known not to be FOO for U3 [12, Theorem 3].
The BICM-GMI of XPAM is shown in Fig. 4 for the set
of bit probabilities [PC0 (0), PC1 (0), PC2 (0)] = [0.5, p, p] for
different values of p. For p = 0.5, the uniform distribution
is obtained. As p decreases, the Gray-coded constellation
approaches a zero-mean binary alphabet, which is FOO [9,
Fig. 2] [15, Fig. 3(b)]. The results in Fig. 4 show the tradeoff
between the low- and high-SNR regimes: The SL can be
approached by decreasing p, but this causes a decrease in MI
in the high-SNR regime. Alternatively, the SL can be attained
by switching from the Gray code to the NBC, but this also
comes with a heavy penalty at higher SNRs.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
We have characterized BICM systems that attain the SL
−1.59 dB at asymptotically low SNR, i.e., FOO constellations.
Somewhat disappointingly, the set of probabilistically shaped
FOO constellation is no larger than the set of FOO constellations with uniform distributions, disregarding translations of
