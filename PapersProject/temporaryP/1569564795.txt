Signal-to-Interference-Ratio and reliability regime, where the
density of active nodes is small. For multi-antenna systems,
[5] analyzes interference-alignment in such networks and
[6] analyzes Carrier-Sense-Multiple-Access (CSMA) networks
with multiple antennas using a Poisson approximation for node
positions.

Abstract—An asymptotic technique is presented to characterize
the bits/symbol achievable on a representative wireless link in a
spatially distributed network with active interferers at correlated
positions, N receive diversity branches, and linear MinimumMean-Square-Error (MMSE) receivers. The models analyzed
include analogs to Matern type I and type II networks. It is
found that for our network models, with large N, the correlation
between interferer positions does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
bits/symbol resulting in simple approximations for the data rates
achievable in such networks with moderately large numbers of
diversity branches.
Index Terms—Matern, MIMO, MMSE.

In this work, we consider interference-limited wireless
networks with interferers distributed on a plane with receive
diversity and linear Minimum-Mean-Square-Error (MMSE)
receivers. This diversity could be from multiple antennas,
multiple frequencies or other forms of diversity. We consider
interference-limited networks in order to focus on networks
with a high density of active nodes. The interferers that are
actively transmitting in this work are spatially correlated. In
particular, the active interferers in our model could come from
a dependent thinning of an underlying process of independent
node positions which we call the dependent thinning model.
Note that our dependent thinning model can be used to
analyze hard core models that are very similar to type I and
type II Matern hard-core processes, which have been used to
approximate CSMA networks (see e.g. [7], [3] and others).
Hence our ﬁndings are useful to analyze the behavior of wireless networks that have multi-antenna nodes with CSMA-like
protocols, and networks with signiﬁcant physical limitations
on minimum inter-node separation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In wireless networks with multiple diversity branches such
as multi-antenna systems, interference mitigation can improve
frequency reuse, increasing aggregate data rates. Since signal
and interference strengths are inﬂuenced by relative node
positions, the spatial distribution of nodes strongly inﬂuences
the performance of these networks. Most works on wireless
networks with spatially-distributed nodes assume that the
locations of active nodes are independent, a good model for
networks with uniformly-random spatial node distributions
and uncoordinated transmissions. In many situations however,
active nodes may be spatially correlated, e.g. in networks with
coordinated transmissions such as networks with MediumAccess-Control (MAC), and systems with signiﬁcant physical
constraints on how close nodes may get to each other such as
vehicular networks.
The analysis of wireless networks with spatially correlated
transmitters is well known to be difﬁcult. Most related results
in the literature deal with interference modeling for systems
with no diversity, and utilize bounds or asymptotic approaches
to handle the complexity associated with correlated node
positions. For instance [1] analyzes hard-core networks (where
nodes are prohibited from transmitting in the vicinity of other
nodes), by ﬁnding bounds on the mean interference in these
networks. [2] analyzes clustered networks and [3] and [4]
analyze networks with correlated node positions in the high

We use an asymptotic analysis to handle the complexity
associated with correlated interferer positions, taking the number of diversity branches N and interferers in the network
to inﬁnity but keeping their ratio constant to derive simple
approximations to appropriately normalized versions of the
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) and achievable data rates (bits/symbol) when Gaussian transmissions are
assumed, on a representative link. The asymptotic analysis
indicates that as the diversity order at the receiver increases,
the spatial dependence between active transmitters does not
strongly inﬂuence the data rates in such networks which
result in simple approximate expressions which we validate
by Monte Carlo simulation.

(1) holds. All limiting results refer to this regime. The main
results are given in terms of limiting values of a normalized
α
version of the SINR, βN = N −α/2 rT SINR, at the output
of the MMSE receiver. This normalization is used because
the (un-normalized) SINR grows with the number of diversity
branches as N α/2 .

A. General network model
Consider a circular network of radius R centered at the
origin, with a representative receiver at the origin. The representative receiver is in a link with a representative transmitter
located at a ﬁxed point XT which is at distance rT from the
origin. Note that these points are assumed to be deterministic
in our model.
The representative receiver has N diversity branches (e.g.
antennas or frequency diversity). In addition to the representative transmitter, there are n other potential transmitters in the
network which when active, are co-channel interferers to the
representative link. Some of the potential transmitters will not
be actively transmitting as described later in this section. Let
the potential interferer locations be denoted X1 , X2 , · · · , Xn
with the distance of the i-th potential interferer from the origin
denoted by ri = |Xi |. The n potential interferers are i.i.d. with
uniform probability in the circular network such that the area
density of potential interferers ρp satisﬁes
n = π ρp R 2 .

B. Spatial Correlation Model
The active nodes in the network are assigned nonzero transmit powers by a function g(.) such that P =
g (X1 , · · · , Xn ; XT ), where we emphasize that g(.) could depend on XT . g(.) controls which of the n potential interferers
are transmitting, and since it is parameterized by XT , the
transmit powers of the interferers are a function of the locations of all potential transmitters (potential interferers and the
target transmitter) in the network. We assume that g(.) results
in a distribution of transmit powers that are stationary with
respect to the indexing variable i, i.e. P1 , P2 , · · · , Pi , · · · , Pn
are stationary with respect to i. Note that this is not the same
as requiring spatial stationarity.
The correlation between the positions of the active nodes
needs to satisfy a covariance constraint on the received powers
from the potential interferers. Deﬁne a variable ai (x) which
indicates if pi is less than or equal to x i.e.,

(1)

The average power (averaged over the fading realizations)
received at each diversity branch of the representative receiver
from an interferer at distance ri transmitting with power Pi is
−α
pi = Pi ri , with α > 2. The transmit powers of the potential
interferers, Pi either equal Pt > 0, or zero, and the transmit
power of the representative transmitter is ﬁxed at Pt . Therefore, the vector of transmit powers P = (P1 , P2 , · · · , Pn )
controls which of the potential interferers are active, and the
representative transmitter is always active. We assume that the
power used by the active transmitters Pt = N α/2−1 P , with P
a positive constant. We scale the transmit powers in this way
to keep the system interference-limited (which is the focus of
this work) as N increases. Without this assumption, as the
diversity order of the system increases, the MMSE receiver
will suppress interference to levels comparable to the noise
resulting in a system that is no longer interference-limited.
Scaling the transmit power with the diversity order in this
manner ensures that the system remains interference-limited
enabling a meaningful asymptotic analysis. Note that since
the signal and interference powers are assumed to be equal
in this work, their speciﬁc value does not inﬂuence the SINR
when the noise power is negligible.
The vector y contains the sampled signals at the N diversity
branches of the representative receiver and is given by

for all x > 0 . (4) amounts to requiring that the correlation
between received powers at the origin due to the transmitters

This last requirement simply means that as the size of the
network goes to inﬁnity, the probability of an interferer being
active is independent of its distance from the origin.

a deterministic limit as given in the theorem below.

of variance σ 2 per complex dimension.

Note that ρ is the effective density of active transmissions

of intensity λ. For the Type I process, each point of the
underlying Poisson process that is within a distance h from
another point of the underlying process is removed. For the
Type II process, a point of the underlying Poisson process is
retained only if there is no other point of the Poisson process
within a distance h of it which has a mark of lesser value.
Thus, these processes are the result of dependent thinning of
an underlying Poisson point process. To incorporate an active
transmitter at a particular location, the Matern process has
to be conditioned on having a node at that location which
leads to added mathematical complexity as the probability
of a node being at a particular point is zero. We sidestep
this complexity for HC-I and HC-II by assuming that the
representative transmitter is not part of the random process
but is located at a deterministic point.
Recall that (P1 , P2 , · · · , Pn ) = g(X1 , X2 , · · · , Xn ; XT )
assigns the transmit powers to the potential interferers and
can be deﬁned as follows. For the HC-I model, g(.) assigns
Pi = 0 if either |Xi −XT | < h or ∃j such that |Xi −Xj | < h.
Pi = Pt otherwise. For the HC-II model, g(.) assigns Pi = 0
if either |Xi − XT | < h or ∃j such that |Xi − Xj | < h and
Mi > Mj . Pi = Pt otherwise. These deﬁnitions of g(.) satisfy
(4) as shown in Appendix B.
For the HC-I model, in the limit as R → ∞, Pr(Pi >
0) = exp(−ρp πh2 ), which is the density of a Matern type I
process. For the HC-II model in the limit as R → ∞, Pr(Pi >
1
0) = ρp πh2 (1 − exp(−ρp πh2 )), which is the density of a
Matern type II process. Thus, the mean bits/symbol for these
models are given by (8) with ρ = ρp exp(−ρp πh2 ) or ρ =
1
2
πh2 (1 − exp(−ρp πh )).
Assuming that the approximation in (8) holds, and making
the simplifying assumption that each link in the network is of
length rT , we can approximate the mean bits/symbol per unit
area as

the SINR is not strongly inﬂuenced by the dependence of
the transmit powers as β is only dependent on the marginal
probability that a node is selected to transmit. This leads
to simple approximations to the bits/symbol given later in
this section as the complicated dependence between transmit
powers becomes negligible with large N .
Assuming that all nodes use Gaussian code books we
estimate the bits/symbol using the Shannon formula, CN =
log2 (1 + SINR). By the continuity of the log function it can
be shown that
α

log2 (1 + SINR) − log2 1 + N 2 β

→0

with probability 1 as N → ∞ in the manner of Theorem 1.
Furthermore, applying the bounded convergence theorem in
the manner of [8], we can show that
α

E [log2 (1 + SINR)] − log2 1 + N 2 β → 0.
α

Hence, log2 1 + N 2 β is a good approximation for the mean
bits/symbol when the diversity order N is large.
Additionally, if the noise power is small and the diversity
order of the system is much smaller than the number of
potential interferers n, b is small, and the second two terms
on the LHS of (6) are small. βN can then be approximated as

We apply the above techniques to two hard-core models
which we refer to as HC-I and HC-II, which are closely related
to the Matern Type I and II models commonly used to model
hard-core processes (e.g. see [9]). Hard-core models can serve
as simple models for active nodes in systems with mediumaccess-control (MAC) protocols where nodes that are close
to each other are not allowed to transmit simultaneously. For
instance, the Matern Type II model has been suggested as
a model for CSMA networks [10] in which nodes are not
allowed to transmit if they detect an ongoing transmission in
their vicinity.
In the HC-I model we assume that all n potential interferers
in the radius R network are active unless they are within
a distance h of any other interferer or the representative
transmitter. In the HC-II model, each interferer is assigned
an independent uniform (0, 1] random variable called a mark,
where the mark assigned to the i-th interferer is Mi . All
potential interferers are active unless they are within a distance
h of the representative transmitter, or if they are within a
distance h of any interferer and have a higher mark than that
interferer.
In comparison, the Matern type I and type II point processes
are constructed from an underlying Poisson point process

spatially correlated and receivers have N diversity branches
with linear MMSE processing. In particular, we consider
networks which are the result of the dependent thinning of
an underlying process of independent node positions. The
thinning operation is such that the received powers of pairs
of nodes satisfy a particular covariance criterion which are
satisﬁed by the HC-I and HC-II models deﬁned in Section IV,
which are analogous to Matern type I and II models which are
popular hard-core models in stochastic geometry.
For systems satisfying our model, we ﬁnd that when the
number of diversity branches N grows large, the dependence
of the interferer locations on the bits/symbol of a representative
link in the network plays a diminishing role. As a result, the
mean spectral efﬁciency for large N can be accurately approximated using simple expressions. The asymptotic results are
validated for ﬁnite-sized systems by Monte carlo simulations.
These ﬁndings provide insight into wireless networks with
correlated transmissions, for which only a limited number of
results exist in the literature.

and are given in the corresponding ﬁgures.
Figure 1 illustrates the mean bits/symbol from simulations
of the HC-I model with guard zones that are a multiple of
the length of the representative link. Note from the ﬁgure
that the asymptotic approximation is very close to the simulated mean bits/symbol. For N ≥ 6 diversity branches, the
simulated and asymptotic mean bits/symbol (from (8)) with ρ
deﬁned appropriately) are virtually indistinguishable. Figure 2
illustrates the mean bits/symbol from simulations of the HC-II
model with guard zones that are a multiple of the length of the

approximation is very close to the simulated mean bits/symbol,
even when the number of diversity branches is small. Figure
3 shows the bits/symbol obtained from 100 simulations of the
HC-II process for different receive diversity orders. The concentration of points with increasing diversity order indicates
that the bits/symbol concentrates on the asymptotic prediction
which implies convergence in probability (although the theory
predicts convergence with probability 1).

A. Proof of Main Result
The main property we use to prove this theorem is the
convergence of the empirical distribution function (e.d.f.) of
the pi s which is the proportion of the pi s that are ≤ x.
Note that the pi s are correlated random variables and the
convergence of their e.d.f. is not as straightforward as it would
be if they were uncorrelated. Note that the set of ai s for
which Pi > 0 forms an associated set, since any subset of
independent random variables forms an associated set (see e.g.
[11] Chapter 20). If the associated random variables satisfy
the covariance requirement in (4), it is known that the ai s

From [13], it is known that if the e.d.f. of the received

B. Proof that hard-core model satisﬁes covariance criteria
Consider HC-I model where no interferer within distance
h of another interferer or the representative transmitter are
allowed to transmit. Recall that as n → ∞, R → ∞, and
consider two arbitrary points X1 and Xk . The probability that
1
|X1 − XT | < h or |Xk − XT | < h decay to zero as R2 . Thus
to prove the covariance criteria in the limit as n → ∞, we can
focus on the case that both |X1 −XT | > h and |Xk −XT | > h.
If |X1 − Xk | > 2h, then P1 > 0 if and only if there is
no other interferer in B(X1 , h), where B(X, r) is a disk of
radius r centered on X. Similarly if |X1 −Xk | > 2h, Pk > 0 if
and only if there is no interferer in B(Xk , h). Since B(X1 , h)
and B(Xk , h) are disjoint for |X1 − Xk | > 2h, P1 > 0 and
Pk > 0 are independent. If |X1 − Xk | > 2h, as n, R → ∞,
r1 and rK are asymptotically independent so a1 (x) and ak (x)
are asymptotically independent as well. Furthermore, if |X1 −
Xk | < h, P1 = Pk = 0 and a1 (x) = ak (x) = 0. Let’s denote
the event D1k as the event that h < |X1 − Xk | < 2h. Hence,
conditioned on the complement of the event D1k denoted by
c
D1k , a1 (x) and ak (x) are identically zero or asymptotically
c
independent. Hence Cov(a1 , ak |D1k ) → 0.
Additionally, for notational simplicity, deﬁne the random
c
variables e1 = E[a1 |D1k ], e1 = E[a1 |D1k ], ek = E[ak |D1k ],
