On Cooperation in Multi-Terminal
Computation and Rate Distortion
Milad Seﬁdgaran and Aslan Tchamkerten

Abstract—A receiver wants to compute a function of two correlated sources separately observed by two transmitters. One of the
transmitters is allowed to cooperate with the other transmitter by
sending it some data before both transmitters convey information
to the receiver. Assuming noiseless communication, what is the
minimum number of bits that needs to be communicated by each
transmitter to the receiver for a given number of cooperation
bits?
In this paper, ﬁrst a general inner bound to the above three
dimensional rate region is provided and shown to be tight in a
number of interesting settings: the function is partially invertible,
full cooperation, one-round point-to-point communication, tworound point-to-point communication, and cascade.
Second, the related Kaspi-Berger rate distortion problem is
investigated where the receiver now wants to recover the sources
within some distortion. By using ideas developed for establishing
the above inner bound, a new rate distortion inner bound is
proposed. This bound always includes the time sharing of KaspiBerger’s inner bounds and inclusion is strict in certain cases.

we recover the results of [7], [1], [10], and [8] (assuming no
side information at the receiver).
If instead of recovering f (X, Y ) exactly, the receiver wants
to recover X and Y within some prescribed distortions, we
obtain the rate distortion problem considered by Kaspi and
Berger [3].
Building on ideas used to establish the above inner bound,
we derive a new inner bound for the Kaspi-Berger rate
distortion problem which always includes, and sometimes
strictly, the time sharing of Kaspi-Berger’s two inner bounds
[3, Theorem 5.1] and [3, Theorem 5.4].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we formally
state the problem and provide some background material and
deﬁnitions. In Section III, we present our results, and in
Section IV we provide proof sketches for certain results.

I. I NTRODUCTION
There has been a growing interest in communication problems where instead of recovering sources of information, the
receiver wants to compute a function of them. Related information theoretic works addressed a number of speciﬁc settings
including one and two-round point-to-point communication
[7], cascade network [1], [10], and multiple-access network
[5], [6], [8].
In this paper, we investigate the role of cooperation in
computation and consider the noiseless network conﬁguration
depicted in Fig. 1 which includes all the above settings as
special cases. Two sources, X and Y , are separately observed
by two transmitters, and a receiver wants to compute a
function f (X, Y ) of the sources. Transmitter-X ﬁrst sends
some information to transmitter-Y (cooperation phase), then
both transmitters send information to the receiver. The problem
is to ﬁnd the minimum number of transmitted bits so that the
receiver can compute f (X, Y ) reliably.
We ﬁrst provide a general inner bound for the above
function computation problem. This bound is tight for the case
of unlimited cooperation, i.e., when transmitter-Y knows X,
and for the class of functions that are partially invertible, i.e.,
when X or Y is a function of f (X, Y ). In addition, the bound
is also tight for the above mentioned speciﬁc settings for which

Let X , Y, and F be ﬁnite sets, and f : X × Y → F. Let
{(xi , yi )}∞ be independent instances of random variables
i=1
(X, Y ) taking values over X × Y and distributed according to
p(x, y).
Deﬁnition 1 (Code). An (n, R0 , RX , RY ) code consists of
three encoding functions
ϕ0 : X n → {1, 2, .., 2nR0 }

III. R ESULTS

Deﬁnition 2 (Rate Region). A rate pair (R0 , RX , RY ) is
achievable if, for any > 0 and all n large enough, there exists
an (n, R0 , RX , RY ) code whose error probability is no larger
than ε. The rate region is the closure of the set of achievable
(R0 , RX , RY ).

We ﬁrst provide a general inner bound to the rate region
(see Deﬁnition 2).
Theorem 1 (Inner bound-Computation). (R0 , RX , RY ) is
achievable whenever

The problem we consider in this paper is to characterize the
rate region for given f and p(x, y).
Conditional characteristic graphs play a key role in coding
for computing [11], [4], [8]. Below we introduce a deﬁnition
of conditional characteristic graph tailored for the problem at
hand.

R0 ≥ I(X; U |Y ),
RX ≥ I(V ; X|T, W ),
RY ≥ I(U, Y ; W |V, T ),
RX + RY ≥ I(X, Y ; V, T, W ) + I(U ; W |V, X, T, Y ),
for some T , U , V and W that satisfy

Notation. Given two random variables X and W , where X
ranges over X and W over subsets of X ,1 we write X ∈ W
whenever P (X ∈ W ) = 1.

T − U − X − Y,
V − (X, T ) − (U, Y ) − W,

Recall that an independent set of a graph G is a subset of
vertices no two of which are connected. The set of independent
sets of G is denoted by Γ(G).

and
X ∈ V ∈ M(Γ(GT
X|U,Y )),
(U, Y ) ∈ W ∈ M(Γ(GT |V )).
U,Y

Deﬁnition 3 (Conditional Characteristic Graph). Let T be an
arbitrary discrete random variable taking on values in some set
T . Given (X, T, Y ) ∼ p(x, t, y) and f (X, Y ), Gt , t ∈ T ,
X|Y
is deﬁned as the conditional characteristic graph of X given
Y for T = t. Speciﬁcally, Gt
X|Y is the graph whose vertex
set is X and such that xi and xj are connected if for some
y∈Y

The rate region of Theorem 1 turns out to be tight in a
number of interesting cases which we now list.
The ﬁrst case holds when the function is partially invertible
with respect to X, i.e., when X is a function of f (X, Y ).
Theorem 2 (Partially invertible function). The inner bound is
tight when f (X, Y ) is partially invertible with respect to X.
In this case, the rate region reduces to

i. p(xi , t, y) · p(xj , t, y) > 0,
ii. f (xi , y) = f (xj , y).

R0 ≥ I(X; U |Y ),

Let V be such that X ∈ V ∈ Γ(GT ) and such that
X|Y
(V, X, T, Y ) ∼ p(v, x, t, y). Gt |V , t ∈ T is deﬁned as the
Y
conditional characteristic graph of Y given V for T = t.
Speciﬁcally, Gt |V is the graph whose vertex set is Y and such
Y
that yi and yj are connected if for some (v, xi , xj ), v ∈ V,
xi , xj ∈ X

RX ≥ H(X|U, W ),
RY ≥ I(Y ; W |X, U ),
RX + RY ≥ I(X; U ) + H(X|U, W ) + I(Y ; W |U ),
for some U and W that satisfy

i. p(v, xi , t, yi ) · p(v, xj , t, yj ) > 0,
ii. f (xi , yi ) = f (xj , yj ).

U − X − Y,
X − (U, Y ) − W,

When T is constant, we write the above conditional characteristic graphs as GX|Y and GY |V , respectively.

and
Y ∈ W ∈ M(Γ(GU |X )).
Y

Note that, given (X, T, U, Y ) ∼ p(x, t, u, y) and f (X, Y ),
T
GT
X|U,Y and GU,Y |V , for some V such that X ∈ V ∈
T
Γ(GX|U,Y ), can be deﬁned in the same way as above by
˜
deﬁning the function f (x, u, y) = f (x, y).

In each of the following three cases, one of the links is rate
unlimited.
When there is full cooperation between transmitters, i.e.,
when transmitter-Y has full access to source X, the setting is
captured by the condition R0 ≥ H(X|Y ) and is depicted in
Fig. 2(a).

Deﬁnition 4 (Conditional Graph Entropy [7]). Given
(X, Y ) ∼ p(x, y), the conditional graph entropy is deﬁned
as
def

HGX|Y (X|Y ) =

R0 ≥ H(X|Y ).

with repetitions, e.g., if S = {0, 1}, then {0, 1, 1} is a multiset.

for this case was established in [7, Theorem 1].

inner bound is tight when
RY ≥ R0 + H(Y ) .
(a)

In this case, the rate region reduces to

(b)

R0 + RX ≥ HGX|Y (X|Y ) .
(c)

Finally, when RX = 0 there is no direct link between
transmitter-X and the receiver, and the situation reduces to
the cascade setting depicted in Fig. 2(d). The rate region for
this case was established in [1, Theorem 3.1] (see also [10,
Theorem 2]).

Theorem 6 (Cascade). The inner bound is tight when

In this case, the rate region reduces to

RX = 0.

R0 ≥ H(X|Y ),

In this case, the rate region reduces to

RY ≥ H(f (X, Y )|T ),
RX + RY ≥ H(f (X, Y )) + I(X; T |f (X, Y )),

R0 ≥ HGX|Y (X|Y ),
RY ≥ H(f (X, Y )) .

for some T that satisﬁes
T − X − Y.
Rate Distortion

When condition RX ≥ H(X) holds, the situation reduces
to the two-round communication setting depicted in Fig. 2(b).
The receiver, having access to X, ﬁrst conveys information to
transmitter-Y , which then replies.

Theorem 1, gives an inner bound to the rate-distortion
problem with zero distortion. It turns out that this inner bound
is in general larger than the rate region obtained by Kaspi and
Berger in [3, Theorem 5.1] for zero distortion. The reason
for this lies in Kaspi and Berger achievable scheme upon
which their inner bound relies. In fact, for any distortion
their scheme implicitly allows the receiver to perfectly decode
whatever is transmitted from transmitter-X to transmitterY . By contrast, we do not impose this constraint in the
achievability scheme that yields Theorem 1. More generally,
by relaxing this constraint it is possible to achieve a rate region
that is in general larger than the rate region derived by time
sharing of Kaspi-Berger’s two inner bounds, [3, Theorems 5.1,
5.4].

Theorem 4 (Two-round point-to-point communication). The
inner bound is tight when
RX ≥ H(X) .
In this case, the rate region reduces to
R0 ≥ I(X; U |Y ),
RX ≥ H(X),
RY ≥ I(Y ; W |X, U ),
for some U and W that satisfy

Theorem 7 (Inner bound-rate distortion). (R0 , RX , RY ) is
achievable whenever

U − X − Y,
X − (U, Y ) − W,

R0 ≥ I(X; U |Y )

and

RX ≥ I(V ; X|T, W )

Y ∈ W ∈ M(Γ(GU |X )).
Y

RY ≥ I(U, Y ; W |V, T )

The rate region in the above case RX ≥ H(X) was previously established in [7, Theorem 3]. However, the range of
the auxiliary random variable W was left unspeciﬁed, except
for the condition that U, W, X should determine f (X, Y ). By
contrast, Theorem 4 speciﬁes W to range over independent
sets of a suitable graph.
When RY is unlimited, i.e., when the receiver looks over
the shoulder of transmitter-Y , the setting is captured by
condition RY ≥ R0 + H(Y ) and reduces to point-to-point
communication as depicted in Fig. 2(c) with the transmitter

RX + RY ≥ I(X, Y ; V, T, W ) + I(U ; W |V, X, T, Y )
if there exist some T , U , V and W that satisfy
T − U − X − Y,
V − (X, T ) − (U, Y ) − W,
and if there exist functions g1 (V, T, W ) and g2 (V, T, W ) such
that
Ed(XY, gi (V, T, W )) ≤ Di , i ∈ {1, 2}

R0
for some 0 ≤ α ≤ H(X|Y ) , where the right hand side of above
R0
equation becomes minimized by choosing α = H(X|Y ) .
On the other hand, by letting U = X1 , T = Constant,
p−d
V = Bern( 1−2×d ),3 and W = f (X1 , Y ), Theorem 7 gives
that for R0 = H(X1 |Y ) the sum rate

To show that the the Kaspi-Berger general inner bound
[3, Theorem 5.1] is included into the rate region deﬁned by
Theorem 7, it sufﬁces to set T = U in Theorem 7.
In the speciﬁc case of full cooperation, [3, Theorem 5.4]
provides an inner bound which, in this case, corresponds to
Theorem 7. To see this it sufﬁces to set U = X and V to be
a constant in Theorem 7.
So, from the above statements, it can be concluded that
Theorem 7 includes the rate region derived by time sharing
of two schemes of Kaspi-Berger, [3, Theorems 5.1, 5.4].
Within the following example we show that in some cases,
this inclusion is strict.
Let X = (X1 , X2 ), with X1 independent of X2 , be
independent of Y , where X1 and Y are distributed uniformly
over {1, 2, 3} and X2 = Bern(p), p ≤ 1 . Deﬁne the binary
2
function f (X1 , Y ) to be 1 whenever X1 = Y and 0 otherwise.
Let the distortion function to be hamming distance and the
distortion criteria to be as

RX + RY = H(f (X1 , Y )) + Hb (p) − Hb (d),

is achievable. Comparing (5) and (6) for R0 = H(X1 |Y ) and
noting that
1
Hb ( ) = H(f (X1 , Y )) < H(X1 ) = log2 (3)
3
H(X1 |Y ) < H(X|Y ) = H(X1 |Y ) + Hb (p)
concludes that for this example Theorem 7 strictly includes
the time sharing of two schemes [3, Theorem 5.1] and [3,
Theorem 5.4].
IV. A NALYSIS
Due to space constraint we shall only prove Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 1: Our coding procedure consists
of two phases. In the ﬁrst phase transmitter-X sends
(T (X), U (T (X))) using Slepian-Wolf coding [9] to
transmitter-Y and in the second phase, transmitterX and transmitter-Y send (T (X), V (X, T (X))) and
(T (X), W (Y, T (X), U (T (X)))), respectively using SlepianWolf coding to the receiver where U (T (X)), V (X, T (X))
and W (Y, T (X), U (T (X))) are chosen conditioned on
T (X).
Pick T , U , V and W as in the theorem. These random
variables together with X, Y are distributed according to some
p(v, x, t, u, y, w).
T
For t ∈ T , v ∈ Γ(GT
X|U,Y ) and w ∈ Γ(GU,Y |V ), deﬁne
˜
f (v, t, w) to be equal to f (x, y) for all x ∈ v and (u, y) ∈ w
such that p(x, t, u, y) > 0. Further, for t = (t1 , . . . , tn ), v =
(v1 , . . . , vn ) and w = (w1 , . . . , wn ) let

ˆ
Ed(f (X1 , Y ), f ) = 0,
ˆ
Ed(X2 , X2 ) ≤ d, d ≤ p.
First, we claim that for any value of R0 , in the achievable
scheme [3, Theorem 5.1], we have
RX + RY ≥ H(X1 ) + Hb (p) − Hb (d).

(1)

This is true because in their scheme, whatever X-transmitter
sends to Y -transmitter will be retransmitted to the receiver;
so, the sum rate constraint is at least as big as the point-topoint problem where a transmitter has X, and a receiver who
has Y wants to recover f (X1 , Y ) and X2 with distortions
0 and d, respectively. For the point-to-point case, due to the
independence of X1 and X2 , as well as (X1 , X2 ) and Y , the
minimum number of bits is
R0 (f (X1 , Y )) + Rd (X2 ),

def ˜
˜
˜
f (v, t, w) = {f (v1 , t1 , w1 ), . . . , f (vn , tn , wn )} .

where R0 (f (X1 , Y )) is minimum number of bits for recovering f (X1 , Y ) with zero distortion, which due to [7, Theorem
2] equals to
HGX1 |Y (X1 |Y ) = H(X1 ),

Generate 2nI(X;T ) sequences
(i)

(i)

t(i) = (t1 , t2 , . . . , t(i) ) ,

(2)

and Rd (X2 ) is minimum number of bits for recovering X2
with distortion d, which is equal to

i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2nI(X;T ) }, i.i.d. according to the marginal
distribution p(t).
For each codeword t(i) , generate 2nI(X;U |T ) sequences

Hb (p) − Hb (d).

u(j) (t(i) ) = (u1 (t1 ), u2 (t2 ), . . . , u(j) (t(i) )) ,
n
n

(j)

(3)

Equations (2) and (3) concludes (1).
Second, in the scheme [3, Theorem 5.4] for R0 = H(X|Y )
the minimum sum rate is
RX + RY = H(f (X1 , Y )) + Hb (p) − Hb (d).

(i)

(j)

(i)

j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2nI(X;U |T ) }, i.i.d. according to the marginal
distribution p(u|t), and randomly bin each sequence
(t(i) , u(j) (t(i) )) uniformly into 2nR0 bins. Similarly, generate
2nI(V ;X|T ) and 2nI(U,Y ;W |T ) sequences

RX + RY ≥ α × H(f (X1 , Y )) + (1 − α) × H(X1 )
+ Hb (p) − Hb (d).

(i)

(k)
v (k) (t(i) ) = (v1 (t1 ), v2 (t2 ), . . . , vn (t(i) )),
n

So, (1) and (4) concludes that for any time sharing of two
achievable schemes [3, Theorems 5.1, 5.4] we have
(5)

that X2 = V + Z, where Z = Bern(d) is independent of V .

ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ
(T , V (T ), W (T )) = (T (1) , V (1) (T (1) ), W (1) (T (1) )),

respectively, i.i.d. according to p(v|t) and p(w|t), and randomly bin each sequence (t(i) , v (k) (t(i) )) and (t(i) , w(l) (t(i) ))
uniformly into 2nRX and 2nRY bins, respectively. Reveal
the bin assignment φ0 to the both encoders and the bin
assignments φX and φY to the encoders and decoder.
Encoding: First phase: Transmitter-X ﬁnds a sequence
(t, u(t)) that is jointly robust typical with x, and sends the
index of the bin that contains this sequence, i.e., φ0 (t, u(t))
to transmitter-Y .
Second phase: Transmitter-X ﬁnds a unique v(t) that is
jointly robust typical with (x, t), and sends the index of the
bin that contains (t, v(t)), i.e., φX (t, v(t)) to the receiver.
The transmitter upon receiving the index q0 , ﬁrst ﬁnds a
ˇ ˇ ˇ
ˇ ˇ ˇ
unique (t, u(t)) such that (t, u(t), y) becomes jointly robust
ˇ ˇ ˇ
typical and φ0 (t, u(t)) = q0 , otherwise it declares an errors.
ˇ
Then, it ﬁnds a unique w(t) that is jointly robust typical
ˇ ˇ
with (u(t), y), and sends the index of the bin that contains
ˇ
ˇ
ˇ
ˇ
(t, w(t)), i.e., φY (t, w(t)) to the receiver.
If a transmitter doesn’t ﬁnd such an index it declares an
errors, and if there are more than one indices, the transmitter
selects one of them randomly and uniformly.
Decoding: Given the index pair (qX , qY ), declare
˜ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ
f (t, v (t), w(t)) if there exists a unique jointly robust typical
ˆˆ ˆ
ˆˆ ˆ
ˆ ˆ ˆ
(t, v , w) such that φX (t, v (t)) = qX and φY (t, w(t)) = qY ,
˜(t, v (t), w(t)) is deﬁned. Otherwise declare
ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ
and such that f
an error.
Probability of Error: In each of two phases there are two types
of error.
In ﬁrst phase, the ﬁrst type of error occurs when no (t, u(t))
is jointly robust typical with x. The probability of this errors
is shown to be negligible in [7] due to the number of generated
codewords t and u(t).
ˇ ˇ ˇ
The second type of error occurs if (t, u(t)) = (t, u(t)).
Due to the Markov chain

˜
there is no error, i.e., f (V (1) , T (1) , W (1) ) = f (X, Y ) by
deﬁnition of robust typicality and by the deﬁnitions of T , V
and W . Similarly to [3], one can show this probability of error
goes to zero when other inequalities of the Theorem hold. Due
to the lack of space, we just compute the probability that
ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ
(T , V (T ), W (T )) = (T (1) , V (1) (T (1) ), W (1) (T (1) )), (8)
in all three coordinates. The number of triples that satisfy (8)
is roughly
2nI(X;T ) × 2nI(V ;X|T ) × 2nI(U,Y ;W |T ) .

The probability that each triple that satisfy (8) has the same
bin numbers (qX , qY ) is roughly
2−nRX × 2−nRY ,

(10)

and the probability that the triple become jointly robust typical
is roughly
2−nI(V ;W |T ) .

(11)

So, from (9), (10) and (11), the probability of event (8) goes
to zero, when n is large enough and RX + RY is larger than
I(X; T ) + I(V ; X|T ) + I(U, Y ; W |T ) − I(V ; W |T )
= I(X, Y ; V, T, W ) + I(U ; W |V, X, T, Y )

it can be shown that the probability of this error goes to zero
when
R0 ≥ I(X; U |Y ).

In second phase, the ﬁrst type of error occurs when no
ˇ
v(t), respectively w(t), is jointly robust typical with (x, t),
ˇ y). The probability of each of these
ˇ
respectively with (u(t),
two errors is shown to be negligible in [7] due to the number
of generated codewords v(t) and w(t). Hence, the probability
of the ﬁrst type of error is negligible.
The second type of error refers to the Slepian-Wolf coding
procedure. By symmetry of the encoding and decoding procedures, the probability of error of the Slepian-Wolf coding
procedure, averaged over sources outcomes, over t’s, v(t)’s
and w(t)’s, and over the binning assignments, is the same
as the average error probability conditioned on the transmitters selecting T (1) , U (1) (T (1) ) ,V (1) (T (1) ) and W (1) (T (1) ).
Note that whenever
