respectively. More recently, the exact closed-form expressions
for the random coding error exponent, cutoff rate and critical
rate have been derived in [2] in case of MIMO Rayleigh ﬂat
fading channels. The expurgated error exponent was studied in
[7] in case of a point-to-point discrete memoryless channel and
shown that the expurgated exponent bounds are greater than or
equal to the exponent of the RCEE bounds for all rate pairs.
The prior works have profoundly improved our knowledge on
this topic, but all of the works have ignored the product fading
model.
In this paper, we derive the exact expressions for the random
coding and expurgated error exponents of Rayleigh fading
product MIMO channel [8]. These analytical expressions are
based on the well known Gamma and Hypergeometric functions, and can be used to ﬁnd the necessary codeword length to
achieve the predeﬁned error probability at a given rate below
the MIMO channels capacity. Moreover, we derive the closedform expressions for the ergodic capacity and cutoff rate for
the proposed model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system
model is described in Section II. The formulation of random
coding error exponent, expurgated error exponent, ergodic
capacity and cutoff rate illustrated Section III. Section IV
describes the numerical results of this paper. Finally, Section
V provides the concluding remarks of this work.

Abstract—Along with the channel capacity, the error exponent
is one of the most important information theoretic measures of
reliability, as it sets ultimate bounds on the performance of communication systems employing codes of ﬁnite complexity. In this
paper, we derive the closed-form expressions for the Gallager’s
random coding and expurgated error exponents for Rayleigh
fading product multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels
under the assumption that there is no channel-state information
(CSI) at the transmitter and perfect CSI at the receiver. From the
derived analytical expressions, we get insight into an elementary
tradeoff between the communication reliability and information
rate for the Rayleigh fading product MIMO channels. Moreover,
we can easily compute the necessary codeword length without
the extensive Monte-carlo simulation to achieve predeﬁned error
probability at a given rate below the channel capacity. In
addition, we derive the exact closed-form expressions for the
ergodic capacity and cutoff rate based on easily computable
Meijer G-function. The closed-form expressions for the error
exponents, ergodic capacity and cutoff rate have also been derived
for Rayleigh fading keyhole MIMO channels as the example of
special case.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Shannon gives a stronger form of channel coding theorem
[1], to determine the behavior of error probability Pe , which
is a function of the code length N and information rate
R. This function is called reliability or error exponent of a
communication system [2] and deﬁned as
opt
− ln Pe (R, N )
,
E(R) := lim sup
N
N →∞

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a MIMO communication system with nt
transmit antennas and nr receive antennas, where the channel
remains constant for Tc symbol periods and changes independently to a new value for each coherence time. We consider
the channel coding over Nb independent coherence intervals.
Therefore, for an observation interval of Nb Tc symbol periods,
the received signal is a sequence of {Y1 , Y2 , . . . , YNb } and
given by

(15)

opt
where Pe (R, N ) is the average error probability of the
optimal code of length N and rate R [3]. This expression tries
to ﬁnd the supremum of function E(R), which is difﬁcult to
compute. In [4], Gallager has given an easily computable lower
bound. Following his work, the exact numerical expression of
error exponent can be found and is well known as the random coding error exponent (RCEE) or Gallager’s exponent.
The RCEE was studied for single-input single-output (SISO)
and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) Rayleigh ﬂat fading
channels with average or peak power constraint in [5] and [6],

E. Expurgated Error Exponent
We obtain the RCEE by selecting codewords independently
according to same input distribution. Since the codeword
selection is unbiased, the good codewords and bad codewords
contribute equally to the overall average error probability.
Therefore, as is well known, the random coding bound can
be improved by expurgating the bad codewords from the code
ensemble at low rates. The direct extension of Gallager’s result
on the expurgated bound is given by,

is given by {Θ}m,n = Γ(v − u + m + n − 1). Using the pdf

Fig.1 shows the effect of antenna diversity on the random
coding error exponent Er (R, Tc ) and expurgated error exponent Eex (R, Tc ) for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel
as a function of rate R. We see that for a certain antenna conﬁguration, both the error exponent Er (R, Tc ) and Eex (R, Tc )
decrease with rate R as one expects. Since the improved
antenna diversity by increasing ns , nt and nr decreases the
probability of error, therefore, both the error exponents are
found to increase with ns , nt and nr . It is observed that
although error exponents increase with ns , nt and nr but the
effect of nt and nr on the error exponents is more signiﬁcant
than ns . Similar effect of antenna diversity is observed on the
cutoff rate as illustrated in Fig.2. But the cutoff rate increases
with SNR.

the validity of derived expressions. Also, we present some
numerical results to clear the insight of derived expression.
Based on our formulation and from the observation of numerical results, we can conclude that by expurgating the bad
codewords from the code ensemble, expurgated error exponent
shows an improved result as compared to the random coding
error exponent. In order to maintain a ﬁxed SNR with a certain
power allocation and noise variance, code length should be
increased with the symbol coherence time. On the other
hand, for a ﬁxed symbol coherence time, coding complexity
decreases with SNR but the decreasing rate is low in the high
SNR regime.

which in turn causes an reduction in the error exponent as
one expects. Therefore, in order to maintain a ﬁxed SNR
with a certain power allocation and noise variance, code
length should be increased with Tc which is illustrated in
Table I and II. It should be noted that Table I and II show
the effects of increasing SNR and Tc on the required code
lengths for Rayleigh fading product MIMO channel with
nr = nt = ns = 2 in order to achieve the decoding error
r
ex
probabilities Pe ≤ 10−6 and Pe ≤ 10−6 , respectively at
a transmission rate 2.0 bits/symbol. In both the tables, we
see that coding complexity decreases with SNR and increases
with Tc . But the decreasing rate is not constant, For example,
as illustrated in Table I, increasing SNR from 11dB to 12dB
reduces the 26.7% of the code length but the code length
reduces only 10.5% when SNR increases from 19dB to 20dB.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we derive the closed form analytical expressions for the random coding error exponent, expurgated error
exponent, ergodic capacity and cutoff rate for Rayleigh fading
product MIMO channels in order to investigate the tradeoff
between communication reliability and information rate. The
analytical results are veriﬁed via Monte-Carlo simulation.
Matching between the simulation and analytical results justify
