Free probability, as proposed in [12], [13] allows to infer the
AEDs of sums or products of Hermitian random matrices with
known eigenvalue distribution provided that these Hermitian
random matrices are free. This allowed to deal with a great
number of channel models in wireless communications and
put the basis for the success of free probability in information
theory of wireless channels, see e.g. [8], [10], [14].
Still there are channel models with great practical importance which are not simply sums or products of Hermitian
random matrices with known eigenvalues distributions. The

Abstract—This paper studies the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution (AED) and the mutual information of a multiuser
(MU) multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) channel with a
certain fraction of users experiencing line-of-sight. It shows that
the AED of the channel matrix decomposes into two separate
bulks for practically relevant parameter choices and differs very
much from the common assumption of independent identically
distributed (iid) entries which induces the quarter circle law. This
happens even without antenna correlation at either side of the
channel. In order to tackle this problem the paper makes use of
recent developments in free probability theory which allow to deal
with complex-valued eigenvalue distributions of non-Hermitian
matrices by means of quaternions.

I. I NTRODUCTION
MU-MIMO systems have received a great deal of attention recently as they also serve as a models to describe
the propagation of virtual MIMO systems were the multiple
antennas are not co-located but belong to different cooperating
users. The capacity region of a MU-MIMO system depends
on the singular values of the channel matrix that governs
the propagation from all (virtual) transmitting antennas to all
(virtual) receiving antennas.
In multi-antenna systems, signal propagation is dominated
by two mechanism: line-of-sight and scattering. In single-user
MIMO systems, the line-of-sight component, if present, has
high power, but rank one while the scattered component has
lower power but high rank. In MU-MIMO systems, the line-ofsight component of the channel matrix is not limited to rank
one, as the antennas need not be co-located. Several earlier
works have addressed this scenario, see e.g. [1]–[4].
The rank of the line-of-sight component is typically lower
than the rank of the scattered component as the existence of
a direct path is less probable than the existence of an indirect
path. With the scattered component having higher rank, but
lower power, the question which of the two components is
more important is non-trivial. Furthermore, it is expected that
the interplay of both components is important to understand
the properties of MU-MIMO systems.
In the large system limit, i.e. the number of antennas grows
to inﬁnity with a ﬁxed ratio between the number of transmit
to receive antennas, the properties of MIMO systems can be

are not free, while the terms in (1) are not Hermitian.
In this paper, we will make use of a free probability calculus
for non-Hermitian random matrices recently discovered in
[15]1 to analyze the AEDs of MU-MIMO systems. First, we
will introduce the system model in Section II. Then, analyze
it in Section III making use of the quaternionic extension of
free probability theory discussed in Section IV. Conclusions
are outlined in Section V.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
Consider the MU-MIMO communication link introduced
in (1). This model neglects potential antenna correlation at
transmitter and receiver side. Such correlations can be easily
taken into account by the modiﬁed channel model [9]

will thus ignore antenna correlation in this paper and solely
focus on the more challenging problem of ﬁnding the AED of
HH † .
Assuming users with equal powers2 and following [7], the
random matrices H 1 ∈ CS×T and H 2 ∈ CR×S are assumed
to have iid complex Gaussian entries with zero mean and
variances 1/S and 1/R, respectively, where T, S and R denote
the number of transmit antennas, of scatterers, and of receive
antennas, respectively. The line-of-sight matrix H 0 is not iid,
since some users may not experience line of sight, in general.
Assuming users with equal powers again, it is well modeled
as
H 0 = G0 P 0

III. MU-MIMO S YSTEMS
Using the results outlined in Section IV, we easily ﬁnd:
C OROLLARY 1 Let the entries of the independent T × T
matrices H n be iid4 with zero mean and variance 1/T for all
N
n. Then, the empirical eigenvalue distributions of n=1 H n

and H n converge almost surely to the same limit given by

∀n as T → ∞.
In other words, independent square random matrices with iid
entries behave with respect to multiplication asymptotically
as if they were identical. This means, that running through
the same i.i.d. random channel twice or running consecutively
through two random channels with the same statistics makes
no difference in the large-system limit. By contrast, this does
not even hold approximately if the channel is a diagonal matrix. A more general form of Corollary 1 is found in Theorem 4
which explains this surprising equivalence in distribution by
means of the bi-unitary invariance of the measure of H n .

where G0 is iid complex Gaussian with zero-mean and variance 1/R and P 0 is a diagonal matrix with L ones and T − L
zeros on the diagonal.
Quaternionic free probability allows to ﬁnd complex-valued
asymptotic eigenvalue distributions and is thus well-suited for
the analysis of a channel model like (1). However, H is not
square, in general. Nevertheless, assuming T ≤ R,3 we can
write
˜
H = HP

˜
with H ∈ CR×R and P ∈ {0, 1}R×T with ones on the
diagonal and zeros elsewhere. Obtaining the AED of HH †
˜ ˜†
given the AED of H H is a straightforward exercise in
classical multiplicative free convolution and omitted here due
to space limitations. Similarly, the rectangular matrices H 1
and H 2 can be represented by equivalent square matrices.
Thus, we assume T = R in the sequel for sake of readability
and space limitations and leave the generalization to nonsquare matrices to the reader. We are, thus, left with only
three parameters in the large system limit. One is the relative
scattering attenuation σ introduced in (1). The second one is

More involved calculations based on the results in Section IV lead to:

With the help of (17), Theorem 1 allows to calculate the
asymptotic singular value distribution of the channel (1). The
respective density function is shown in Fig. 1 for 4φ = 4σ =
ρ = 1. This examples was chosen, since the relative scattering
attenuation σ and line-of-sight fraction φ are small, in practice.
In that case, the asymptotic singular value distribution of H
decomposes into two bulks with each bulk being shaped very
similar to the cases of pure scattering and pure line-of-sight
when scaled or shifted appropriately. This deviates strongly
from the quarter circle law that would be obtained, if H were
composed of iid entries.

Mutual information for γ = 9 dB and ρ = 1 versus φ and σ.

sight fraction φ and the relative scattering attenuation σ that
are typical in many practical scenarios are quite deleterious
for the mutual information of the channel. Furthermore, the
ﬁgure seems to suggest that blocking the line of sight is better
than a small, but non-zero value of the line-of-sight fraction
φ. However, Fig. 2 is plotted for constant SNR and blocking
the line of sight will surely decrease the SNR.
The hit in mutual information for small line-of-sight fraction
and relative scattering attenuation is exacerbated in practice by
the fact that analog-to-digital conversion and precise estimation of the scattered paths is challenging in the presence of
much stronger direct paths.

Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues. The method of
choice to deal with real-valued eigenvalue distributions in free
probability is to utilize complex analysis, i.e. to represent a
real-valued eigenvalue distribution

as a limit of a complex-valued holomorphic function G(s),
which is known as the Stieltjes transform and deﬁned by

p(z) =

dP(x)
.
(22)
s−x
Complex-valued eigenvalue distributions are often not holomorphic. They can be represented by a pair of holomorphic
functions representing real and imaginary part. Instead of real
and imaginary part of a complex variable z, one can also
consider z, its complex conjugate z ∗ , and apply the Wirtinger
rule [20] for differentiation, i.e.
∂z
∂z ∗
≡ 0 ≡ ∗.

A. Stieltjes Transform
In order to generalize the Stieltjes transform to two complex
variables z and z ∗ , we ﬁrst rewrite (22) by

We deﬁne the bivariate Stieltjes transform by
2

(35)

RA+B (p) = RA (p) + RB (p) .

(36)

The scaling law of the R-transform generalizes as follows
RzH (p) = zRH (pz)

(37)

(25)

.

p(z) =

log |s − z|2 +

and obtain for free random matrices A and B, with RA (p)
and RB (p) denoting the R-transforms of the respective AEDs,

for z ∈ C. Note that the order of factors does matter here,
since pz = z ∗ p.
While additive free convolution generalizes straightforwardly, this is very different for multiplicative free convolution. Due to space limitations, we refer the reader to [21].

Thus, we have

We deﬁne the R-transform of quaternion argument p in
complete analogy to the complex case in [12] as

This matrix representation directly connects (30) with (31) via

and the deﬁnition (v +iw) ≡ v ∈ C.6 Quaternions are inconvenient to deal with since multiplication of quaternions does
not commute, in general. However, any quaternion q = v + iw
can be conveniently represented by the complex-valued 2 × 2

At ﬁrst sight, the bivariate Stieltjes transform looks quite

performed without quaternionic free calculus as follows:

In a subsequent journal version of this paper, we will include
the more general case of rectangular channel matrices, i.e.

Then, the AED of H is circularly symmetric and given by
pH (z) =

1
2πzf [f −1 (z)]

(41)

with f (s) = df (s)/ds wherever the density is positive and
continuous.
Furthermore, the following lemma relating the Stieltjes
transform of the symmetrized singular value distribution of
a square matrix X to the Stieltjes transform of the eigenvalue
distribution of XX † turns out quite helpful:
L EMMA 1 (TABLE II IN [19]) Let
1
˜
Gλ (s) =
2

pλ (x) + pλ (−x)
dx.
s−x

Then
˜
Gλ (s) = s Gλ2 s2 .

R-diagonal random matrices have the property to behave as
if they are identical with respect to multiplication:
T HEOREM 4 (P ROPOSITION 3.10 [22]) Let the random matrices An have the same AED, be R-diagonal, and asymptotiN
cally free of each other for all n. Then, the AEDs of n=1 An
N
and A1 are identical.
V. C ONCLUSIONS AND O UTLOOK
Line of sight strongly inﬂuences the eigenvalue distribution
of multi-user MIMO channels. If the line-of-sight component
is signiﬁcantly stronger than the scattered paths and/or the
fraction of users who experience line of sight is small, the
eigenvalue distribution is composed of two separate bulks, one
corresponding to the scattered paths and one corresponding
to the direct paths. In that case, the AED can be accurately
approximated by a scaled version of pure scattering and a
shifted version of pure line of sight which, in contrast to the
exact solution, can be given in closed explicit form.
While Stieltjes transforms in one complex variable cannot uniquely deﬁne a complex-valued eigenvalue distribution,
a generalized Stieltjes transform in two complex-valued or
one quaternion-valued variable can do so. Quaternion-valued
Stieltjes transforms allow to deal with a much larger class
