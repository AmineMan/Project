degrees of freedom of the X channel in [5] and [6]. It refers
to a signaling scheme which leads the transmitted messages to
overlap in the receivers where they cause interference while
being distinguishable at the desired receivers. In [8], authors
characterized the generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF) of
this network using a deterministic approach combined with
the interference alignment technique.
The deterministic X channel, physically is the same as the
deterministic interference channel introduced in [9]. Recently,
Niesen and Maddah-Ali in their arxiv report [10] showed that
the binary deterministic (BD) model proposed in [9], although
simpliﬁes the analysis of the channel capacity in certain
scenarios, is not capable of capturing all of the channel characteristics needed for the characterization of the capacity region
of a Gaussian X channel. Preserving more characteristics of
the channel coefﬁcients, they introduced another deterministic
model called Lower-Triangular Deterministic Model, which
is used to characterize the capacity region for Gaussian X
channel within constant bits gap.
In this study we consider a symmetric 2-user scenario in
which the set of channels observed by each receiver is the
same as the other one. We tackle the problem of throughput
maximization in this scenario. In such a symmetric channel,
throughput is an appropriate metric. Following the foot steps
of Minero et al. [3], we assume each of the two transmitters are
active with probability p independent of each other. In order
to simplify our analysis, we adopt a deterministic approach.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The system
model as well as the Virtual Access Point (VAP) representation, is presented in Section II. In Section III, The main
results of the study are provided. Firstly, the upper bounds
are derived for the achievable rates of the network. Then the
Fourier Motzkin Elimination [11] is used to characterize the
rate region, which is the convex hull of some corner points,
for each of which an achievablity scheme is provided. The
optimized throughput and the required signaling scheme is
provided in Section IV. Finally Section V concludes the paper.

Abstract—We study a 2-user symmetric X channel with
random access capability for transmitters from a deterministic
point of view. Transmitters can work in two modes of operation
independent of each other, either active or inactive. There is an
independent message from each transmitter to each receiver. It is
aimed in this study at maximizing the throughput of this network
over the set of rates which can be reliably communicated. To
characterize this rate region, an information theoretic outerbound is derived. Achievability is based on opportunistic signal
transmission along with a linear pre-coding scheme. Once the
rate region is exactly determined, throughput maximization can
be solved as a linear programming problem.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Increasing demand for wireless networks has made channel sharing inevitable in such networks. One of the main
responsibilities of the medium access control (MAC) layer in
each network is to present a procedure to coordinate how the
network users should access the shared wireless medium. The
design of this procedure highly depends on the structure of
the network and the type of the communicated data between
the users. Some of these methods including the Time and
Frequency Division Multiple Access schemes require a central
or partial controller. The other types of access mechanisms do
not have this central brain and each user decides independently
to whether transmit in a given time slot or not. These methods
are usually categorized in the category of random medium
access protocols. ALOHA [1], CSMA, and CSMA/CD [2] are
some examples of random access mechanisms.
Recently, Minero, Franceschetti and Tse [3] have proposed
a novel method with an information-theoretic nature which
captures the behaviors of the nodes in a network for a
general multiple access channel. In this model, the transmitters
can independently be active with certain probability without
having any knowledge about the status of the others. The
random level of interference due to the random set of active
transmitters is exploited to transmit different streams of data
in different states, thereby recovering more information bits
when fewer number of transmitters are active.
In this study, we explore the presence of random access in
a symmetric two-user X network which is comprised of two
transmitters, two receivers and four independent messages;
one corresponding to each transmitter-receiver pair. In fact,
X channel is the simplest Gaussian network in which interference alignment technique is necessary in order to obtain
the capacity or degrees of freedom. Interference alignment,
ﬁrstly introduced in [4], was used to characterize the total

For problem setup,we use the Symmetric Binary Deterministic.
Avestimehr et al. introduced the binary deterministic interference channel [7] which is the ﬁrst order approximation of the
interference channel. In the binary deterministic channel, the
received signals at Rx1 and Rx2 can be represented by:

this model, nij s represent the cut-off noise/path loss values of

X channel with random access feature.

There are four independent messages {w 11 , w12 , w21 , w22 }
in the X channel, where w mk represents the message from
transmitter k to receiver m. The unit average power constraint
is assumed at transmitters. We deﬁne a rate R ij is achievable
if there are deterministic functions f and g respectively for
encoding and decoding such that receiver i can decode w ij
with arbitrarily small probability of error as the block length
is large enough.

the receivers have the same marginal distribution, the observed
output at each receiver from its desired transmitted signals is
a degraded version of its output when only one of them is
active. In other words:

The idea of Virtual Access Points (VAP) model was ﬁrst
proposed in [3]. In this model, each receiver is substituted with
a number of virtual ones, each of which corresponds to a set
of of active transmitters. In this setting, we consider a Binary
Deterministic X channel with two users, each goes active with
probability p. We assume that the transmitters’ states do not
change during each transmission. In this setup, each sender
transmits several streams of data, a subset of which will be
decoded by the receivers when both transmitters are active

(wmk for m, k ∈ {1, 2}). When one of the transmitters is not

active, another subset of messages w mk will opportunistically
be decoded, where the index k determines the active transmitter. When both senders are active and the additive noises at

Where R∗ is the amount of excessive rate which can be
opportunistically decoded when one of the users is not active.
Using the VAP model the equivalent network is modeled with
the same transmitters which are always active but the receivers
ate replaced by three distinct subsets of virtual receivers
according to the different states of the transmitters (see Fig
1). In this setup, the channel throughput can be written as:

III. M AIN R ESULTS
In this section, we ﬁrst derive the information theoretic
bounds governing the achievable rate tuples for the proposed
VAP model for the deterministic symmetric RAC-X. Then
we characterize the capacity region as the convex hull of
some extreme points each of which is achievable. As the
exact characterization of the capacity region of the network
is obtained, we ﬁnd the maximum throughput of the network.

characterize this region, it is enough to ﬁnd the corner points
of this region. This is done by a simple method known as
Fourier-Motzkin Elimination [11].
Using fourier-Motzkin Elimination, it is observed that the
corner points of the system of inequalities in theorem (1)
fall into four different subsets, according to the value of
3

α belonging to one of the intervals [0, 2 ], [ 1 , 2 ], [ 2 , 4 ],

[ 4 , 1]. Some of these corner points are dominated by each
other, i.e. for two given vectors v 1 and v2 , v1 dominates
v2 if each coordinate of v 1 is greater than or equal to the
corresponding coordinate of v 2 . If a dominant corner point
is proved to be achievable, then all the other corner points
being dominated by that are also achievable by decreasing
some rates. Each of these corner points can be deﬁned as a

dominant ones for different values of α. The list of all
dominant corner points can be found in [12]. Due to lack
of space we do not list them all but will provide some
charactresitics of them.

[ 2 , 3 ], the dominant corner point v 8 = [nα, 0, nα, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

maximizes the throughput. Finlay for α ∈ [ 3 , 1] the dominant

rate tuple maximizing throughput for some values of p is v 10 =

The detailed proof of Theorem 1 can be found in [12]. Here
we brieﬂy provide the intuition behind these bounds. The ﬁrst
four inequalities (1a-1d) are directly imposed by the system
model. The next four inequalities (1e-1h) are based on the
multiple access bound for the channel. For example, (1e) can
be derived from the MAC bound

B. Acheivabile Scheme
The dominant corner points of the polytope with respect
to the set of Inequalities in theorem 1 are of three different
types. The ﬁrst type comprises those rate tuples which do
not have any excessive rate for opportunistic decoding, when
the transmitter is not active. The achievable scheme for these
points is the same as that of X channel which is based on
interference alignment [8]. These rate tuples play a fundamental role in contributing to maximizing the throughput. The
rate tuples of the second type are those which do not have
any rate to be transmitted in the X channel scenario. These
rate tuples can be trivially achieved. The third class is the
set of rate tuples for which the total rate is shared between
the two different scenarios. The achievable scheme for this

at receiver one, combined with the inequality R 11p ≤ n(1−α),
which is immediate result of the system model. The inequality
(1i) is introduced in [10] for a general 2-user X channel. The
last four inequalities (1k-1n) are totally information theoretic
bounds derived from Fano’s inequality using similar technique
as in [10].
It can be seen that the rate region described by the set of
linear inequalities in theorem (1) is a convex region. In order to

3

4

(The proof of achievability for this point with another example
can be found in [8]). As for the example set the transmission
signal X1 (most signiﬁcant bit in the left hand side) to be

class is tricky in some cases.The main idea is to exploiting the
locations devoted to the interfering signals in the X channel
setting to transmit a message opportunistically when the other
transmitter is not active.
Among these rate tuples, it is observed that the rate tuple
v7 = [n(1 − α), 0, n(1 − α), 0, nα, 0, nα, 0] always maximizes
the throughput function regardless of the probability p, when
α ∈ [0, 1 ].This rate tuple also contributes to maximizing the
2
the throughput in the other regimes, when the probability of
activeness of each transmitter is low.
Note that, given a rate tuple, when the transmission rates
through both direct and cross links is the same for each of
the transmitter/receiver pairs, the signaling scheme at each of
the transmitters, as well as the decoding scheme at each of
the receivers, is the same. Thus, in such symmetric cases, we
avoid repetition and only sketch the signaling scheme at one
of the transmitters, and likewise the decoding scheme at one
of the receivers.
In order to achieve v 7 , transmitter 1 reserves the ﬁrst
n(1 − α) most signiﬁcant bits of X 1 to carry the information
X
bits of the message w11 . This is the amount of rate required
when both two users are active and is evidently decodable.
RA
The remaining nα bits are devoted to w 11 which are decoded
opportunistically when the other user is not transmitting. At
receiver 1, the received n bits always contain n(1 − α) bits
which are protected form interference and will be decoded
X
eventually as w11 . The remaining nα bits are mixed with the
interference and will opportunistically be decoded when the
other sender is not active.
In the following, we sketch the achievability scheme for the
other points which maximize the throughput for higher activity
probabilities of the transmitters, for the other regimes in terms
of α,.
When α ∈ [ 1 , 2 ], the other point which maximizes the
2 3
throughput for higher activeness probabilities of the transmitters is v8 = [nα, 0, nα, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The required signaling
scheme to achieve this point is to locating the private and
X
common part of w 11 , respectively in the ﬁrst n(1 − α) least
signiﬁcant bits and ﬁrst n(2α − 1) most signiﬁcant bits of X 1
and setting the remaining bits to zero.
The other point which contributes to maximizing the
2 3
throughput when α ∈ [ 3 , 4 ] is v9 = [n(2 − 2α), n(3α −
2), n(2 − 2α), n(3α − 2), 0, 0, 0, 0] which does not require
any excessive rate when one of the transmitters is off. In
the achievable signaling scheme for this rate tuple, the ﬁrst
X
n(1−α) LSB of X1 carry the private part of the message w 11 .
The ﬁrst n(1 − α) most signiﬁcant bits carry the common part
X
of w11 and the next n(3α − 2) bits right after the common
X
X
part of w11 are devoted to w 21 . All the remaining bits are set
X
to zero.In this setting, interfering messages (i.e. w 21 and the
X
common part of w 22 ) are received aligned in the ﬁrst receiver.
3
When α is approaching 1, namely α ∈ [ 4 , 1], the achievable scheme is based on interference alignment (linear precoding). The rate tuple v 10 = [⌊n − nα ⌋ − ⌊ nα ⌋, ⌊ nα ⌋, ⌊n −
3
3
3
nα
nα
nα
3 ⌋ − ⌊ 3 ⌋, ⌊ 3 ⌋, 0, 0, 0, 0] is the one which maximized the
throughput meanwhile provides the maximum sum rate for
the X channel. The achievable scheme for this rate tuple is
9
illustrated in the following example for n = 11 and α = 11

X1 = [w11 (1), w11 (2), w21 (1), w11 (3) + w21 (2), 0, w21 (3),
w11 (3), 0, w21 (3), w11 (4), w11 (5)]
We use the same signaling for X 2 . This way, what is received
in the receiver 1 is
[w11 (1),w11 (2), w21 (1) + w22 (1), w11 (3) + w21 (2) + w22 (2),
w12 (1), w21 (3) + w22 (3) + w12 (2), w11 (3), w12 (3),
w21 (3) + w22 (3), w11 (4), w11 (5) + w12 (3)]
X
As it can be seen, the information bits w 11 (i), i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}
X
and w12 (i), i ∈ {1, 3} can be directly decoded. To decode
X
w11 (5), it is enough to decode the bits Y 1 (8) and Y1 (11)
X
jointly. Joint decoding of Y 1 (7) and Y1 (9) bits,decodes w12 (3)
as well.

IV. T HROUGHPUT O PTIMIZATION
As mentioned earlier, the binary deterministic model represents a ﬁrs-order approximation of the Gaussian channel. We
have assumed the maximum conveyable information across
this channel is 2n bits per channel use, regardless of which set
of transmitters are active. Merging the information theoretic
point of view with the networking one, we can interpret the
parameter p , so as to represent the burstiness of the data
arrivals as well as the probability that each user goes active.
Having found the exact characterization of the capacity region
for the BD symmetric RAC-X, we are now able to formulate
and solve the maximization problem for the throughput. As
mentioned earlier, the network throughput can be written as
follows:

T = max p(1 − p)

which is subject to the constraint that all the rates above
belong to the capacity region of the binary deterministic
,symmetric RAC-X. It can be easily seen that the optimization
of the throughput is a linear programming problem, for each
ﬁxed value of p. So, searching among corner points of the rate
region guarantees ﬁnding the rate tuple R which maximizes
the throughput.As seen in the section II, the dominant corner
points of the rate region vary according to the value of α, so
we consider four different case for the optimization problem.

small values of α is v7 , regardless of the value of p. This implies that each transmitter should dedicate all of its resources
to the desired messages (w 11 and w22 ) at direct receivers.
This leads to the maximum possible decodable rates of the
X network, when both senders are active, as well as some
excessive rate to be conveyed in the absence of the other
transmitter. Therefore, the throughput T is:
T1 = 2pn(1 − pα).

2) 2 ≤ α ≤ 3 : When p is small, it is more likely that one
of the transmitters is not active. In such cases, transmitting
all of the bits which contain information from w 11 and w22
is beneﬁcial. This signaling, when one of the transmitters is
not active, obtains a higher rate. However when both of the
transmitters go active, it suffers a rate loss penalty. Solving
the optimization problem, it can be found out that, for small
values of p, the effective signaling scheme is the one which
achieves the rate tuple v 7 , while as α increases, the effective
signaling is the same as the one used in X-channel, i.e. v 8 .

V. C ONCLUSION
We studied the throughput maximization problem for a
2 user symmetric X channel with random access to the
common wireless medium from a deterministic point of view.
In the optimal signaling scheme, each transmitter, based on the
values of p and α, estimates the state of the other transmitter
and adjusts its encoding rate accordingly. It is observed, for
certain channel gains that interference alignment can improve
the performance of the X channel comparing with the 2 user
interference channel.

4) 4 ≤ α ≤ 1: Using signal transmission with linear precoding makes the X channel preform much better than IC by
exploiting the possibility of suppressing the interference using
the interference alignment. The optimized signaling which is
based on the signal space alignment method is described in
details in [8] and [10]. It can be seen that, depending on the
value of nα, the decision region between the different rate
tuples varies. In this case v7 is sill the main contributing rate
tuple for small values of p. However, the region of contribution
for this signaling is shortened as α increases. For greater
values of p, the best possible signaling is to using the same
scheme as in X channel based on the interference alignment.
The optimal rate tuple in this case is v 10 . It can be seen that
the sum rate transmittable with this rate tuple when both of
transmitters are active is ⌊n − nα ⌋, which is the same as the
3
results of [8].The throughput can be represented as:

3) 3 ≤ α ≤ 3 : Like the previous case, opportunistic
4
decoding is only available for small values of p. Optimizing
the throughput certiﬁes this justiﬁcation; since for the small
values of p, the rate tuple v 7 gives the highest throughput. For
higher values of p, it can be observed that the optimal rate
tuple is v9 .
We can compare this channel with its brother, the 2-user Interference Channel (IC). It is known that, as interference (cross
link strength α) increases, the scheme which achieves the
maximum sum rate in the IC is to decode as much interference
as possible. In our scenario, it can be seen that, as α increases,
it is beneﬁcial to decode the received information over the
cross channel (w12 and w21 ). Interestingly, the throughput is
1
the same as the case 2 ≤ α ≤ 2 , however, the achievable
3
scheme is different.
