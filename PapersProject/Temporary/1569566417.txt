anonymity for the same source-destination pair. To date, the
problem of selecting routes with maximum anonymity while
minimizing packet-loss for a set of source-destination pairs is
yet to be studied.
In this work, given a multipath wireless network with
covert and visible relays, we investigate how to analytically
choose routes for each source-destination pair in order to offer
maximum anonymity while maintaining a packet-loss constraint. We consider two sources of packet-loss: link quality,
determined by transmission power and the distance between
nodes, and packets dropped by covert relays. We formulate the
route selection problem within a rate-distortion framework, in
which the fraction of ﬂow allocated to each route is chosen
to maximize the network anonymity without violating packetloss constraints.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we deﬁne the system and adversary models. In Section III,
we formulate route selection as a rate-distortion problem and
present solution algorithms. Section IV illustrates our results
through simulation study. Section V concludes the paper.

Abstract—In anonymous networks, a subset of nodes is chosen
to act as covert relays to hide timing information from unauthorized observers. While such covert relays increase anonymity,
they cause performance degradation by delaying or dropping
packets. In this paper, we propose ﬂow allocation methods
that maximize anonymity for multipath wireless networks with
predetermined covert relay nodes, while taking into account
packet-loss as a constraint. Using a rate-distortion framework,
we show how to assign probabilities which split the ﬂows from
source to destination among all possible routes and show that
selecting routes according to the assigned probabilities achieves
maximum anonymity given the packet-loss constraint.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In applications requiring anonymous wireless communication, the identities of source-destination pairs for each data
ﬂow should be untraceable. Due to the open wireless medium,
however, an eavesdropper can record timing information about
transmitted packets. If intermediate relays forward messages
as soon as they are received, the timing of the outgoing
and incoming messages at each relay will be correlated. An
eavesdropper can then use trafﬁc analysis to infer sourcedestination pairs.
Designing reliable relays against timing-based trafﬁc analysis is necessary for anonymous networks [1]-[3]. In [4],
the authors showed that, by designing a series of network
relays to embed the packet to be forwarded within a series
of dummy packets (called “chaff packets”), the forwarding
time of the received packet can be randomized in a way that
prevents timing-based trafﬁc analysis. Relays with randomized
forwarding times are denoted covert relays, while other relays
are denoted visible relays [5]. While eavesdroppers are able
to trace packets through visible relays, they are unable to
trace packets through covert relays. Furthermore, in order
to minimize congestion and delays, covert relays may drop
received packets [5]. Consequently, routing packets through
covert relays preserves the anonymity of the source-destination
pairs, but at the cost of reduced throughput and higher packetloss.
In [5] and [8], the authors introduced the problem of
selecting relays as covert and visible based on throughput and
anonymity, under the assumption that each source-destination
pair uses a single route. In typical wireless networks, however,
each source has more than one possible route to the same
destination.
Given a set of covert and visible relays, different routes
will yield different packet-loss as well as different level of

A. Adversary Model
As in [5], we consider global eavesdroppers with knowledge
of the network topology and ability to observe all network
nodes. We assume that packets are encrypted so that eavesdroppers cannot expose source-destination pairs by reading
packet headers. The goal of the eavesdroppers is to identify
source-destination pairs by using timing-based trafﬁc analysis.
B. Relay Deﬁnitions and Notations
In this section, we give the deﬁnition of covert and visible
relays introduced in [5] and specify the notations that will be
used for the rest of the paper.
Deﬁnition 1 (Visible Relays). A visible relay is a relay in
which adversaries are able to trace the forwarded packets back
to the senders. When a sender node ni selects visible relay rj
n
to forward packets, we denote this event by rj i .
As illustrated in Figure 1(a), when visible relay rj is
forwarding packets from n1 , the adversary is able to deduce
that these packets came from node n1 . Hence, we use the
n
superscript n1 in rj 1 to emphasize the adversary’s knowledge
of the source node.

with Lth hop transmission, let the series of intermediate relay
nodes selected by Zi be
RZi = [R1 , R2 , · · · , RL−1 ],
˜

(2)

n
where Rl ∈ {rj i , rj , ri1 i2 ..ik } represents the lth forwarding
relay, which can be either visible, covert or super-node, and
˜
the destination node at the Lth hop. Deﬁne

to be the routes used by the N sources in this network. We
assume that each source chooses its route independently of
other sources. Deﬁne packet-loss rate due to link-quality to be
Pl = L (Zi , RZi ). Furthermore, to reduce latency, if packets
stay in covert relays more than δ time units, they will be
dropped [5]. For each route, deﬁne packet-loss due to packets
dropped by covert relays to be Pc = C (Zi , RZi , δ). (Different
dropping strategies cause different dropping rates; interested
readers can refer to [8] for more discussion about dropping
rate function.)
For source i with transmission rate ηi , and packet-loss rate
Pe (i), let the maximum average packet-loss rate the total

The visible and covert relay assignments

Deﬁnition 2 (Covert Relays). A covert relay transmits packets
according to a pre-speciﬁed probabilistic schedule. When there
are no packets to be forwarded, the covert relay transmits a
dummy packet; otherwise, the covert relay forwards the ﬁrst
packet in its buffer. When sender node ni selects covert relay
rj to forward a packet, we denote this event as rj .
By assumption, adversaries are unable to trace packets by
observing covert relays. As shown in Figure 1(a), if relay
rj is covert, from the eavesdropper’s viewpoint, the current
outgoing packet could be coming from node n1 , node n2 ,
or node n3 . Therefore, unlike the case of visible relays in
Deﬁnition 1, the notation rj is used with no superscripts to
emphasize that the adversary cannot associate a source node
with the observed packets.

represents the fraction of total network throughput originated
at source i. We use H(Z) to represent the uncertainty of all
source-destination pairs. Since eavesdroppers can observe the
timing information R, the uncertainty of the source-destination
pairs to the eavesdropper after timing-based trafﬁc analysis
is deﬁned as H(Z|R). As in [7], we express the network’s
anonymity degree by normalizing the uncertainty of all sourcedestination pairs as

Deﬁnition 3 (Super-node). If there are k covert relays within
one hop of a sender node ni , the set of such k nodes is called
a super-node. The event that any one of the k covert relays
in the super-node is forwarding packets from ni is denoted by
ri1 i2 ..ik

If all the relays in the network are covert, then the timing of
packet transmissions gives the eavesdropper no information
about the source-destination pairs. Hence H(Z|R) = H(Z),
resulting in the maximum anonymity of one.

In the example of Figure 1(b), when node n1 sends a packet
to covert relay rA , eavesdroppers are unable to determine (with
certainty) which one of those three outgoing packets is from
node n1 . In other words, assuming node n1 chose its next hop
relay with equal probability, the three events that node n1 is
sending packets to covert relay rA , covert relay rB , or covert
relay r are indistinguishable. Thus, we use the notation rABC
to represent the event that one of the covert relays rA , rB , or
rC is forwarding a packet from node n1 .

Consider the example of Figure 2 with RB as covert relay.
The source-destination pairs, (S1 ,D1 ), (S2 ,D1 ) and (S3 ,D3 ),
all have multiple routes. The problem considered in this paper
is to ﬁnd the probabilities with which a ﬂow from a source
must be allocated across different possible routes between
that source and a speciﬁc destination in order to maximize
anonymity while satisfying a packet-loss constraint.
Since adversaries can eavesdrop and observe the routes
chosen by sources, denoted by R, maximizing anonymity is
equivalent to minimizing the source-destination pairs information available to eavesdroppers, given by H(Z)−H(Z|R) with
the packet-loss rate as the penalty. Hence, the route selection

C. Network System Model
We consider a network with N sources and M destinations.
Each source i chooses one of the M destinations to send
packets independently of other sources, with transmission rate
ηi . We use Zi , which is a random variable taking a value from
the destination set {D1 , D2 , ...DM }, to represent the sourcedestination pair of source i. We deﬁne PZi (Dj ) to be the
probability of source i choosing destination Dj . Let

We consider the optimization of equation (8) under two
different scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, covert relays do not
drop packets. In the second scenario, we incorporate packetdropping by covert relays. In what follows, we discuss how
to obtain QZi for these two scenarios.

H(Zi ) − H(Zi |R)]

A. Route Selection Without Packet-Dropping by Covert Relays
In this section, we consider the optimization problem of
equation (8) assuming link-quality is the only source for packet
loss. That is, we set the time constraint of the covert relays to
δ = ∞. In this case, the packet-loss rate function in equation
(7) reduces to F (k, j, δ, QZi (j|k)) = L (Zi , RZi ). From [6,10],
∂J
the roots of ∂QZ (j|k) = 0 are

H(Zi ) − H(Zi |RZi )].

Lemma (1) shows that the problem of optimizing the
network’s overall anonymity is equivalent to optimizing the
anonymity of each of the N independent sources individually.
That is, ﬁnding the route for each source-destination pair that
maximizes the anonymity of a given source-destination pair is
independent of all other pairs in the network.
We deﬁne the distortion function for the formulation studied
in this article by averaging the packet-loss rate from each
route. Let QZi (RZi = α|Zi = β) denote the probability that
source i selects route α given the corresponding destination is
β. Assuming the packet losses due to link-quality and packetdropping by covert relays are independent, the packet-loss rate
function can be expressed as
F (Zi , RZi , δ, QZi (RZi |Zi )) = 1 − (1 − Pc )(1 − Pl ).

where qzi (j) = k PZi (k)QZi (j|k) and L(k, j) represents the

by giving the input s. Each value of the parameter s corresponds to a different choice of D, so that varying s allows us
to compute the anonymity-packet loss curve R(D) [6,10].
2 Due to covert relay super-node effect, for multiple routes map to the same
Zi and RZi , we use the route with minimum packet-loss rate for the packetloss rate function F. This is because those multiple routes have the same
anonymity degree.

by Covert Relays

An iterative algorithm for obtaining QZi (j|k) is given as
follows.

When we apply time constraint to covert relays, covert
relays drop the packets staying in buffer more than δ time
units [5]. This increase packet-loss rate. However, the dropping
rate in here is also dependent on the ﬂow allocation, which
is denoted by QZi as described in [8]. Therefore, by solving
∂J
∂QZ (j|k) = 0, where J is as given in equation (8), we obtain

IV. S IMULATION R ESULTS
To verify that our proposed algorithm is optimal, we compare our results with all possible probability assignments.
For simulation, we assume that each source has the same
transmission rate and Zi is uniformly distributed. For the
network shown in Figure 2, with node B acting as a covert
relay without time constraint, i.e., δ = ∞, we compare our
proposed method with all possible probability distributions Q
in Figure 3(a). The ﬁgure shows that our approach is optimal
for this network topology.
Figure 3(b) shows the performance with different
covert relay conﬁgurations, including (RB ), (RA , RB ), and
(RA , RB ,RC ) from Figure 2. When all relays are covert relays,
there is no trade-off between packet-loss rate and anonymity.
Figure 3(b) also shows the maximum anonymity that can be
achieved as a function of the packet-loss constraint D. For
example, when only relay RB is covert, given D is equal to
0.035, the maximum anonymity is 0.788. In order to achieve
this maximum anonymity, the source-destination pair (S1 , D1 )
selects RA and RB to be 0.157 and 0.843, respectively.

where TZi (QZi (αj |β)) = F (β, αj , δ, QZi (αj |β))
+ QZi (αj |β)F ′ (β, αj , δ, QZi (αj |β))
2) Solving the polynomial equation (12) for each QZi (αj |β)
in terms of λ by giving nth order approximation. Then all
the roots can be described in terms of λ. 3) By using the
property j QZi (αj |β)) = 1, we can solve for λ. Once we
ﬁnd λ, we can obtain QZi (αj |β). 4) Let new a equal to

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the problem of route selection in
order to maximize anonymity in wireless networks subject to a
constraint on packet loss. We formulated the problem within a
rate-distortion framework, in which each node independently
chooses a ﬂow allocation among multiple routes. We introduced algorithms for optimal route selection under two cases,
namely the case where covert relays drop packets in order
to avoid congestion, and the case where covert relays do not
drop packets. We evaluated the performance of our algorithms
in both cases via simulation study. While the example for
simulation used the network in Figure 2, the formulation is
applicable to wireless networks with multiple intermediate
hops with prespeciﬁed covert relays.
The main focus of this work was to ﬁnd the optimal route
selection for a given set of covert and visible relays with
independent sources. In our future work, we will investigate
ﬂow allocation when the sources are dependent. We will also
study the problem of joint optimization of both the route
