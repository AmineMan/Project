Characterization of the Constrained Capacity of
Multiple-Antenna Fading Coherent Channels
Driven by Arbitrary Inputs

In this paper, in view of the fact that practical constraints
pertaining to the transmission and reception of information
often dictate the use of discrete inputs (such as PSK or QAM
constellations) in lieu of the ideal capacity achieving Gaussian
ones, we study the constrained capacity of multiple-antenna
fading coherent channels driven by arbitrary (discrete) inputs.
In particular, we focus on the antenna-uncorrelated and the
antenna-correlated Rayleigh fading coherent channel and the
Ricean fading coherent channel, offering insight and concrete
guidelines for signal and system design.
The characterization of the constrained capacity of channels
driven by non-Gaussian inputs is considerably more complex
than the characterization of the channel capacity achieved
by Gaussian inputs. We pursue the analysis by leveraging
asymptotic expansions of the constrained capacity of fading
coeherent channels driven by arbitrary discrete inputs whose
origins trace back to the I-MMSE identity [5], [6]. Other
applications of the I-MMSE identity [7] also appear in [8],
[9], [10], [11]. Due to space limitations, the detailed technical
proofs are referred to [6].

Abstract—This paper characterizes the constrained capacity of
multiple-antenna fading coherent channels driven by arbitrary
discrete inputs in the regime of high signal-to-noise ratio (snr).
In particular, we capitalize on key asymptotic expansions to
unveil the effect on the constrained capacity of various channel
and system parameters, such as the fading model, the number
of transmit and receive antennas, antenna correlation and the
characteristics of the signalling scheme. It is also shown that
the effect of certain parameters on the constrained capacity
is radically different from their effect on the channel capacity
achieved by Gaussian inputs.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In recent years, the surge of interest in multiple-antenna
communications systems has been due to the realization that
the capacity of the canonical independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading coherent channel, where the
receiver knows the channel state but the transmitter knows only
the channel distribution, scales as [1]:1
C(snr) = min(nt , nr ) log(snr) + O(1)

(1)

so that, at high signal-to-noise ratio (snr), the potential gain
in reliable information transmission rate of a multiple- over a
single-antenna system grows (linearly) with the minimum of
the number of transmit or receive antennas, min(nt , nr ).
Of particular relevance has also been the characterization
of the capacity of multiple-antenna communications systems
that embody prominent channel features that go beyond the
canonical model. The crux of the characterizations, which
for analytical tractability have been usually pursued in the
asymptotic regimes of low and high snr, are afﬁne expansions
of the capacity in terms of fundamental performance measures
that unveil the effect of various factors such as the number
of transmit and receive antennas, antenna correlation, antenna
polarization, line-of-sight components, spatially colored noise,
interference, or even key signal features, offering thus a more
realistic view of the potential of multiple-antenna communications (e.g. see [2], [3], [4]).

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a fading channel with nt transmit and nr
receive antennas which can be modeled as follows:
√
y = snr · Hx + n
(2)
for a single use of the channel, where y ∈ Cnr represents the
vector of complex receive symbols, x ∈ Cnt represents the
vector of complex transmit symbols, n ∼ CN (0, I) ∈ Cnr
is the random noise vector and H ∈ Cnr ×nt is the random channel matrix with unit-power random entries, so that
E tr HH† = nt nr . We take the input to conform to an
equiprobable multi-dimensional constellation with cardinality
1
M, i.e., x ∈ {x1 , x2 , . . . , xM }, with Σx = E xx† = nt · I.
We also take the input, the noise and the channel to be
independent. The parameter snr relates to the signal-to-noise
ratio per receive antenna.
We consider a channel matrix that incorporates Rayleigh
fading, Ricean fading as well as transmit and receive antenna

The following Theorem deﬁnes the high-snr behavior of the
constrained capacity when the probability density function of
the squared pairwise Euclidean distance between (noiseless)
receive vectors and the higher-order derivatives obey some
(n)
smothness properties, i.e., pd2 d2 , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . are conij
ij
tinuous and integrable in [0, ∞).
Theorem 1: In the regime of high-snr, the constrained capacity of a multiple-antenna fading coherent channel driven
by arbitrary equiprobable discrete inputs can be expanded as
follows:

where H0 ∈ Cnr ×nt is a deterministic matrix, Hw ∈ Cnr ×nt
is a canonical complex Gaussian random matrix with independent zero-mean and unit-variance circularly symmetric
complex Gaussian random entries and ΘT ∈ Cnt ×nt and
ΘR ∈ Cnr ×nr are unit-diagonal Hermitian positive semideﬁnite matrices with the correlation coefﬁcients between
the nt transmit and the nr receive antennas, respectively.
The Ricean K-factor K corresponds to the ratio between
the deterministic and random component energies. Since the
term H0 corresponds to line-of-sight or diffracted components,
H0 = aR a† where the vectors aT ∈ Cnt and aR ∈ Cnr are
T
associated with the transmit and receive array responses to a
plane wave so that aT 2 = nt and aR 2 = nr . 2
We assume that the receiver knows the channel matrix
realization and that the transmitter knows only the channel
matrix distribution. We also assume that the sequence of
random channel matrices over time is stationary and ergodic.
Consequently, the constrained capacity, achieved by coding
over multiple fading blocks, is given by:
√
(4)
C (snr) = EH I x; snr · Hx + n H
√
where I x; snr · Hx + n H is the mutual information be√
tween input vector x and the output vector y = snr · Hx + n
conditioned on a realization of the channel matrix H.
We pursue an asymptotic characterization of the constrained
capacity exclusively. In particular, we concentrate on the
asymptotic regime of high snr, because the behavior of the
capacity associated with Gaussian inputs is identical to the
behavior of the constrained capacity associated with arbitrary
proper complex inputs in the asymptotic regime of low snr [2].
III. C ONSTRAINED C APACITY C HARACTERIZATION
We build upon the high-snr characterization of the constrained capacity of multiple-antenna fading coherent channels
driven by arbitrary discrete inputs in [5], [6]. A key element of
the characterization is the squared Euclidean distance between
the (noiseless) receive vectors Hxi and Hxj associated with
the transmit vectors xi and xj given by:

The availability of the distribution of the pairwise Euclidean
distances, which is simple to compute in view of the fact
that (5) is a quadratic form in Gaussian random variables for
the most common fading channel models, paves the way to
the characterization of the constrained capacity via Theorem
1. The resulting expansions enable one to articulate about
the impact on the constrained capacity of certain system
parameters.3

Theorem 2 deﬁnes the impact of the number of transmit and
receive antennas as well as the characteristics of the signalling
scheme on the constrained capacity of the canonical i.i.d.
Rayleigh fading coherent channel with arbitrary equiprobable
discrete inputs, in the regime of high snr. In particular, in
view of the bounds in (12), this Theorem is consistent with
the fact that constellations with poor sphere-packing properties
require more signal-to-noise ratio than constellation with good
sphere-packing properties in order to achieve a certain target
constrained capacity in the regime of high snr.
The number of receive antennas controls the rate at which
the constrained capacity value tends to its inﬁnite-snr value,
so that a multiple-receive antenna system requires less signalto-noise ratio than a single-receive antenna system in order to
achieve a certain target constrained capacity in the regime of
high snr. The number of transmit antennas, as opposed to its
effect on the capacity of the canonical i.i.d. multiple-antenna
Rayleigh fading coherent channel [1], does not affect directly
the multiplexing ability of the system because the inﬁnite-snr
constrained capacity value depends solely on the number of
constellation points or vectors. Instead, a higher-dimensional
(complex) space, in comparison to a lower-dimensional one,
enables the construction of more efﬁciently packed multidimensional constellations. This, in view of the bounds in
(12), suggests that a multiple-transmit antenna system requires
potentially less signal-to-noise ratio than a single-transmit
antenna system in order to achieve a certain target constrained
capacity in the regime of high snr. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate
that the asymptotic expansions capture this behavior.

of a Rayleigh fading channel without antenna correlation for
a certain signal-to-noise ratio in the regime of high snr. This
is due to the fact that the value of the bounds in the correlated

In general, the bounds in (22) suggest that the constrained
capacity of a Ricean fading channel is normally higher than
the constrained capacity of the canonical i.i.d. Rayleigh fading
channel for a certain signal-to-noise ratio in the regime of high
snr. This is due to the fact that the function

However, and in contrast to the capacity of a multipleantenna Ricean fading channel [12], the constrained capacity
of a Ricean fading channel can also be lower than the
constrained capacity of a Rayleigh fading channel for a certain
signal-to-noise ratio in the regime of high snr. This aspect is
illustrated further with two examples.
Example 1: Consider a 2 × 2 Ricean fading channel with
two equiprobable discrete inputs x1 = [1 0]T and x2 = [0 1]T ,

Examples 1 and 2 suggest that, due to the bounds in (25)

signal-to-noise ratio than the Rayleigh fading channel, in order
to achieve a certain target constrained capacity in the regime of
