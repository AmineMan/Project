the support of signal and channel coefﬁcients are known to the
transmitter, whereby the image of this particular subspaces
under T is contained in some subspace up to dimension
SF . In both cases an additional factor, logarithmic N , is
necessary for the unknown location of the supports. However,
in the worst case, the sparsity of the inputs to T behave
multiplicatively. The essence of this contribution is to establish
conditions on T under which the overall compressibility still
behaves only additively in S and F . This has a relevant
impact on the complexity of the output set T (ΣS , ΣF ) and
hence substantially improve the rate in compressed sampling.
Furthermore, understanding the coupling between two sparse
sources directly generalizes to the coupling of ﬁnitely many
sources.
In their recent work [1], Hedge and Baraniuk considered
(S, F )-sparse circular convolutions in RN , see Section III, and
formulated a restricted isometry property (RIP) for the set of
all differences in the union of the image of all (S, F )-sparse
circular convolutions. It turns out that their proof approach
leads to difﬁcult mathematical problems, which according to
the authors’ knowledge are still unsolved. Since the proof
in [2, Lemma 5.1] relies on a linear structure, which may
not be present for the image of bilinear maps, more strict
conditions on T and the input sets X and Y are needed to
control the norm of the output set. However, the authors could
establish in this work the result of Hedge and Baraniuk for a
certain restriction on Euclidean convex cones. Another special
case occurs for S and F dimensional subspaces, which are
“properly” separated. In this case, the image under the circular
convolution is isomorphic to the set of all simple tensors,
which in turn is isomorphic to the set of rank-1 operators from
X to Y . Hence the main theorem implies certain results from
the theory of rank-1 matrix recovery [3], [4], [5]. Moreover,
the developed framework applies to all bilinear operations
which have a certain restricted norm multiplicativity property
on convex cones in an arbitrary basis. This enables compressed
sensing on “sparse” output sets, which can not be written as a
ﬁnite union of subspaces, and leads to generalized structured
sparsity models [6], [7], [8].
The outline of this paper is as follow. In Section II the
fundamental concept of bilinear maps T on ﬁnite dimensional Euclidean spaces is introduced. The authors formulate
a sufﬁcient condition in Deﬁnition 1, which ensures a better
probability as in [2] for the RIP on the image of such bilinear
maps. Some important and simple couplings T for certain
communication scenarios are discussed in Section III. Here the

Abstract—For several communication models, the dispersive
part of a communication channel is described by a bilinear
operation T between the possible sets of input signals and channel
parameters. The received channel output has then to be identiﬁed
from the image T (X, Y ) of the input signal difference sets X and
the channel state sets Y . The main goal in this contribution is to
characterize the compressibility of T (X, Y ) with respect to an
ambient dimension N . In this paper we show that a restricted
norm multiplicativity of T on all canonical subspaces X and
Y with dimension S resp. F is sufﬁcient for the reconstruction of output signals with an overwhelming probability from
O((S + F ) log N ) random sub-Gaussian measurements. Thus,
in this case, the number of degrees of freedom of each output
grows only additively instead of multiplicatively with the input
dimensions (sparsity) S and F . This is a relevant improvement in
the output compressibility and suggests a substantially reduced
rate in compressed sampling algorithms.

I. I NTRODUCTION
From an abstract point of view, a dispersive communication
channel is given as a bilinear operation T (s, h) between the
input signal s and the channel parameter h plus additive noise
n. For example, on RN this action could be represented as a
matrix multiplication, i.e. the received signal is then:
r = Hs + n.

(1)

and the corresponding channel matrix H ∈ RN ×N is given
by the action Hs = T (s, h). If the channel matrix is known
at the receiver and the possible input signals s exhibit a
linear structure the set of all outputs Hs is a linear space.
However, if the channel matrix has unknown parameters and
the signal set is for example only a union of subspaces, the
set of all possible outputs usually looses its linearity and
the receiver is thus confronted with the determination of r
from a non-linear manifold. Then, in order to provide efﬁcient
sampling and reception in such a non–coherent setting, it is
of fundamental importance to characterize the complexity of
the output set and relate it to structural properties of the
channel and of the possible transmit signals. In compressed
sensing for example, such an assumption is the sparsity S of
the signal set, i.e. the transmitter might operate in a peaky
fashion and the data is concentrated only on unknown but
small sets of S
N sample points. Let us denote this union
of so called canonical subspaces with ΣS . Even more, the
set of non–zero coefﬁcients in the vector h ∈ RN during
transmission can be small as well, i.e. concentrated on subsets
of cardinality F
N such that h ∈ ΣF . The intrinsic
dimension for sampling the signal r in (1) is S + F as soon

X has dimensionality S if the space span X has dimension
S.

main result is applied to some channel models, e.g. circular
convolutions, which establishes an additive behavior of the
sparsity S and F of the signal inputs and channel states.
Section IV concludes this work with a conjecture for the RIP
on the image of all (S, F )-sparse circular convolutions.

B. Main Theorem
Our main theorem provides a generalized compressed sensing framework by a stable embedding of certain (S, F )-sparse
signal models which can not be anymore described by Ksparse signal models ΣK . Since T has the RNMP, there
exists by Deﬁnition 1 a subset O ⊂ X × Y such that the
representation by T and O leads to a stable embedding of
channel outputs T (s, h) received over a ﬁxed but unknown F sparse channel state h ∈ Y if the difference set of all channel
outputs T (s1 − s2 , h) is a subset of T (X, Y ).
Theorem 1: Let 2 ≤ S, F, N, M ∈ N with SF ≤ N and
X, Y ⊂ RN are S resp. F dimensional convex cones. If the
bilinear map T : X × Y → RN has the restricted norm multiplicativity property with bounds α and β, then a realization
of a sub-Gaussian matrix Φ : RN → RM with M ≤ N and
[Φ]ij ∼ N (0, 1/M ) fulﬁlls for every z ∈ T (X, Y )

II. M AIN R ESULT
Every bilinear map T : RN × RN → RN is a binary
operation on RN and deﬁnes therefore a multiplication on RN .
The N dimensional linear space RN , +, ·, T is then called
an associative algebra1 over R. Since we are interested in a
stable embedding of the output (image), we have to equip the
algebra with a norm · . In our main Theorem 1 we need for
the proof technique, based on [2], a nesting in the 2 -norm,
i.e. we have to bound the norm of the output z by the product
of the norms of the inputs x, y from below and above. This
is a very strict property for algebras since this would imply
that the nullspace of T is N := (0, X) ∪ (Y, 0), i.e. T is
non-singular on X × Y . If we remove all singularity points
in X × Y we obtain a subset O ⊂ X × Y on which T is nonsingular. But then there could still exist a sequence on ∈ O\N
such that limn T (on ) = 0. The following deﬁnition exclude
such sequences and provides how close 0 can be approached.
Deﬁnition 1 (Restricted norm multiplicativity property):
Let X, Y ⊂ RN . Then the bilinear map T : X × Y → RN

Proof: The main idea follows the technique in [2], where
Baraniuk et al. considered a linear subspace Z of RN with a
δ/4-net R for Z 1,1 and obtained by the measure concentration
phenomenon of Gaussian matrices Φ, that for every r ∈ R and
any δ ∈ (0, 1) it holds2 :

In the following we will only consider R with standard
inner product product and the corresponding Euclidean norm

x := x, x . For a given subset X ⊆ RN we will denote
the shell in X with inner and outer radii α and β by X α,β :=
{ x ∈ X | α ≤ x ≤ β} and abbreviate further X α := X 0,α .
The functional x 0 denotes the cardinality of the support of
x in the Euclidean basis {ei }N −1 , i.e. the sparsity of x with
i=0
respect to the Euclidean basis. A convex set X ⊂ RN is a
convex cone if for every x ∈ X and λ ≥ 0 it follows λx ∈ X.

Remark 1: It is known [9], that for ﬁnite–dimensional algebras there always exists β < ∞. Obviously, β is always an
upper bound on O and this simpliﬁcation will become relevant
in the proof of Theorem 1. If α = β(= 1), then the norm is
called multiplicative on O , but only few algebras are norm–
multiplicative.
Essentially, the implicit use of the set O removes the redundancy in representing T (X, Y ), i.e. removing unnecessary
direction pairs in X × Y . Surely, the exact determination of
the set O is a combinatorial hard problem and depends on
T as well as on the subsets X and Y . Moreover, this set in
general lacks for linear or convex properties.

Both, the constant δ and the dimension of Z determine then

x ∈ X (p) := X + p and y ∈ Y (q) := Y + q. The image
T (X (p), Y (q)) is the covering set of the point T (p, q) and
the union forms a covering for Z 1,1 by (13). Note that this
covering sets in Z are not necessarily convex! By using the
triangle inequality and a zero addition in p, q we have for any
T (p, q) ∈ R that all z = T (x, y) ∈ T (X (p), Y (q)) ∩ Z 1,1

(i.e. (x, y) ∈ O1 ∩ X (p) × Y (q)) satisfy:

on the cardinality of R, but now in terms of the covering
numbers N (X 1 , X δ/d ) and N (Y 1 , Y δ/d ). For this we need
to control the norm of z by elements in X × Y which is
possible if T has the RNMP, since the set O does not contain
”bad” representation pairs for Z := T (X, Y ). It is in fact not
necessary to give an explicit parametrization of O. The only
information needed for the proof are the bounds α and β.
Every normalized z ∈ Z 1,1 can be represented as an element
from the image under T of O1 := { o ∈ O | T (o) = 1} ⊂
X × Y . Since T has the RNMP on O we have by Deﬁnition 1
for (x, y) ∈ O1 :

(18)

we obtain the upper bound
Φz ≤ (1 + A)c + ΦT (p, q) .

(19)

The main tool of the proof is the measure concentration in
(8). But there is no norm nesting T (p, q) since in general
˜
˜
(p, q) ∈ O1 . Even if (p, q) ∈ O1 we don’t get from
(13) a tight scaling for vanishing . Therefore we use the
continuity property (bilinearity) of T to upper and lower bound
T (p, q) in terms of for every Cartesian product of two
convex covering sets X (p), Y (q). Let us deﬁne the preimage of T (X (p), Y (q)) ∩ Z 1,1 by

where O1,X and O1,Y are projections of O1 to X resp. Y .
˜
These are axial lines in the shells, see Fig. 1. Note, that O1
can not be written as a Cartesian product, since only certain
pairs are allowed.
The algebraic part of the proof goes as follows: Any
realization of Φ is a linear map on a ﬁnite–dimensional normed
space RN and hence bounded, i.e. there exist A ≥ −1 s.t.

Hence there exist a representation set for Z 1,1 by pairs in
X 1,1 × Y 1/β,1/α . Since α ≤ 1 ≤ β we can also choose a

representation set O1 which is contained in the symmetrized
set of convex shells X a,b ×Y a,b with common inner and outer

and since x−p ∈ X and y−q ∈ Y we can apply the universal
upper bound β of the RNMP in (2) to get:

and from absolute homogeneity of · we have with (10):

˜
α y ≤1≤β y

T (p, y − q) + T (x − p, q)

˜
Z −1 (p, q) := (x, y) ∈ X (p) × Y (q) ∩ O1 .

(14)

If this set is not empty (otherwise (p, q) can be dropped from
P × Q), just grap one pair (x, y) ∈ Z −1 (p, q). But then there
exist3 (c, d) ∈ X × Y s.t. (x, y) = (p + c, q + d) and so:

where 1 + A ≥ 0 denotes the smallest upper bound (operator
norm of Φ restricted to Z). If we can show that A ≤ δ we
have shown the upper bound in (4). Since Φ is linear and
Z a cone (not necessarily convex), it is enough to ﬁnd an
upper bound in (14) for all z ∈ Z 1,1 . Let P ⊂ X a,b and
Q ⊂ Y a,b be -nets for X a,b resp. Y a,b with ∈ (0, 1) and
deﬁne R := {T (p, q) : (p, q) ∈ P × Q} ⊂ Z. It follows that
|R| ≤ N (X b , X )N (Y b , Y ). Thus, every z ∈ Z 1,1 can now
be represented with (13) by a pair (x, y) ∈ X a,b × Y a,b with

T (p, q) = T (x − c, y − d)
= T (x, y) − T (x, d) − T (c, y) + T (c, d) .
3 If X is a convex cone, then p is the aphex point of the covering set X (p)
which is again a convex cone (non-symmetrical), precisely X 1 = X . Hence
x−p ∈ X . If X is a linear space, then X is a ball (symmetric) with center
at the origin and so x − p ∈ X again.

III. A PPLICATIONS
Before using the theorem we will discuss the following
observations. A simple coupling T in (1) is given by the
pointwise multiplication, e.g. a fading channel:

T (p, q) ≤ T (x, y) + T (x, d) + T (c, y) + T (c, d)
2

≤ 1 + 2βb + β

≤ 1 + β(2b + 1) = 1 + c .

Let us discuss the discontinuity of this norm estimation. If we
have α = β, hence norm multiplicativity, then we would get
c = 3. But in fact, this is to bad, since the shells are now unit
spheres and every p, q is normalized and hence by the norm
multiplicativity T (p, q). But this gives c = 0. To respect this
fact we deﬁne c and get for all net point pairs

call such a restricted circular convolution an (S, F )-sparse
circular convolution, see [1]. In general there doesn’t exists
a lower bound α > 0 for sparse circular convolutions, since
the nullspace of T can contain elements (s, h) with s = 0
and h = 0. One can prevent this behavior by restricting the
domain of T to certain convex sets X, Y ⊂ RN .

norm multiplicativity bound α > 0 on any disjoint convex
subsets X, Y ⊂ RN . Hence we can not apply efﬁciently
our theorem on these sets. But actually this is not necessary
here, since for any S, F dimensional subspaces X, Y the
output z has sparsity less than min{S, F } with respect to the
Euclidean basis. In this simple case we can immediately apply
the original Lemma 5.1 in [2] to establish the RIP on X Y
with probability

Then we can use the measure concentration in (8) to obtain
from (19) and (20) with probability larger than in (9)

b) Sparse Circular Convolutions on Positive Cones:
If we assume the channel is only an on/off channel or a
fading channel with positive parameters hi ≥ 0 and the signal
parameters are also positive, then we can easily establish the
following lower bound:

In many communication schemes the coupling of channeland signal parameters is given by bilinear maps T and sparsity
is present in both inputs to T . It is therefore of general interest
for several engineering applications to characterize the compressibility of the whole output set. In this paper we provide
such a characterization once the RNMP can be established,
uniformly or in some probabilistic setting. However, a uniform
treatment of the exemplary case of (S, F )–sparse circular
convolutions is still an open problem. It is also not fully
understood whether the RNMP is only a sufﬁcient or really a
necessary condition for a scaling with O(S +F ). In particular,
it is important to know whether to the following conjecture is
true: Let (X, Y ) be (S, F )–sparse canonical subspaces in RN
(S, F ≥ 2). Does then any realization of a sub-Gaussian matrix
Φ : RN → RM with M ≤ N and [Φ]ij ∼ N (0, 1/M ) fulﬁlls

Hence we obtain together with (32) for positive inputs

The positive elements in span{ei }i∈I with I ⊂ {0, . . . , N −1}
form a canonical (Euclidean) S = |I|-dimensional positive
convex cone X. If X and Y are canonical S resp. F dimensional positive convex cones, then we can apply our theorem
with the norm bounds derived in (33), to establish the RIP
on X Y . With a result of Rogers-Zhong [11] and Rogers
[12] we can ﬁnd an upper bound for the covering number
of S ≥ 3 dimensional positive cones X 1 by N (X 1 , X ) ≤
S
(4/ ) 7S log S. For S = 2 we can upper bound this by the
covering √
number with S-dim ˜-balls contained in X , where
√
˜ = /(2 2). Hence (3/˜)2 = (6 2/ )2 ˜-balls resp. -cones
cover the whole unit ball and hence X 1 . But this number is
less than (4/ )2 14 log 2 and thus Rogers bound holds also for
all S ≥ 2. A rough estimate shows that Rogers bound can
S
be upper bounded for S ≥ 2 by (18/ ) . Since α = 1 and
˜
β = min{S, F } in (33) we get d = d = 21β with (24).
For = δ/d we can hence establish the RIP on X Y by

Here we use the fact, that every simple tensor ˜ ⊗ h has a
s ˜
˜
unique representation up to scalars by ˜ and h, [13]. This
s
implies a norm multiplicativity, i.e. ˜ ⊗ h = ˜ h .

The covering number for an S dimensional ball X 1 ⊂ RN

with X can be upper bounded by N (X 1 , X ) ≤ (3/ ) [10].
Together with the norm multiplicativity (35), 1 = α = β, we
get d = 12 and obtain by Theorem 1 as probability bound

c) Sparse Circular Convolutions and Tensor Products:
A main property of the circular convolution is that the
image of Euclidean basis vectors (ei , ej ) is again an Euclidean basis vector. Let X := span{ei }i∈I and Y :=
span{ej }j∈J with |I| = S and |J| = F . Then it is easy
to show that X
Y = span{ek }k∈I⊕J where I ⊕ J :=
{ (i + j) mod N | i ∈ I, j ∈ J}. If |I ⊕ J| = SF then the
subspaces X, Y are “properly” separated [1] and one can
show easily that the image is Hilbert isomorph (isometric) to
the set of all simple tensor products. This means, there exist
isomorphism, s.t. on these extremal pairs (X, Y ) the norm ·
becomes multiplicatively. Hence we get for all (s, h) ∈ X ×Y
