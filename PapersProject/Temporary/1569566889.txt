A. Previous Results on Capacity of Multiple Access Protocols

Abstract—While there has been much research on the capacity
of the collision channel for multiple access protocols, there
has been little investigation on their fundamental performance
with multipacket reception (MPR)-capable channels, which allow
more than one simultaneous transmissions to be successfully
received. In this paper we investigate the properties of these
MPR channels and provide an upper bound for their multiaccess
capacities with a genie-aided argument. Our results not only give
insights into the limiting efﬁciency with which multiaccessing
can be performed in the MPR environment, but also generalize
familiar results from classical multiaccess theory.

While networks in practice are of ﬁnite sizes, the inﬁnite
population model has been analyzed in the literature because
its performance results are indicative of that for large networks
and can also provide a lower limit to the best that the ﬁnite
population models can achieve. The inﬁnite population model
can also make the analysis more amenable as it frees the
analysis of any boundary conditions.
Based on this model, Abramson [5] introduced the seminal
random access protocol, ALOHA, which delivers a measly
throughput of 1/2e ≈ 0.184 packets per slot. By aligning
transmissions to occur at time-slot boundaries, Roberts [6] created the S-ALOHA that provides a throughput of 1/e ≈ 0.368.
Soon after, Capetanakis [7] developed a tree-based splitting
algorithm to resolve packet arrivals during an interval of time;
it is stable for all arrival rates less than ≈ 0.431. Inspired
by his work, there have been many subsequent research on
collision resolution protocols that are founded on the idea
of partitioning groups of multiple users, as documented in
[8], [1] and the references therein. In particular, Gallager [9]
proposed a ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-serve (FCFS) splitting algorithm
with a capacity of ≈ 0.487. Apparently this protocol was also
independently developed by Tsybakov and Mikhailov [10] and
Ruget [11] as well Later, Moseley and Humblet [12] reﬁned
that algorithm by enabling optimally sized subintervals for
each split to improve the capacity to ≈ 0.488, which has since
remained the highest achievable throughput reported for the
collision channel.
Complementing attempts to design the optimal protocol,
researchers also have pursued upper limits for this channel’s
multiple access capacity, for which an actual protocol needs
not exist to attain. Pippenger [13] used an information theoretic
argument to show that ≈ 0.744 is an upper bound to the capacity. Later, Molle [14] derived an upper bound of ≈ 0.673 by
employing a genie-aided protocol, which was then improved
by Cruz and Hajek [15] with a slightly different genie to
≈ 0.613. Subsequently, by using sophisticated arguments that
analyze the probabilities of the number of packets harbored
in an interval, Mikhailov and Tsybakov [16] and Zheng and

I. I NTRODUCTION
Finding the capacity of multiple access protocols has been
a long-standing problem in communication networks research
[1]. Up to now, the maximum capacity achievable by a
decentralized protocol on the collision channel that allows one
user to transmit at a time is still unknown and an open problem
in this ﬁeld.
While this classical collision channel model may reﬂect
more of the physical (PHY) layers in the past, transceiver
technologies today can separate and correctly decode multiple
packets transmitted simultaneously over the channel. This
capability is commonly referred to as multipacket reception
(MPR) [2] [3]. But similarly, only little is known regarding
such channel’s multiaccess capacity as well.
To advance our understanding on this, in this paper we
investigate properties of the general MPR channel and derive
an upper bound of its multiaccess capacity. Our results here
can provide insights into the limiting efﬁciency at which
multiaccess can perform in the MPR environment. This will
also be useful because researchers in recent years have been focusing on the idea of cross-layer design for wireless networks
with MPR [4] that concerns improving network performance
through cooperation between the media access control (MAC)
layer and MPR-capable physical layers.
Because the classical collision channel is a special case
of the MPR channel, as it will become apparent below, the
channel properties and capacity upper bound that we point out
are in fact generalizations of well-known results from classical
multiaccess theory.

Berger [17] lowered the upper bound to ≈ 0.587 and ≈ 0.578,
respectively. Finally, by incorporating these probabilistic ideas
with the entropy gained about the arrival process from each
transmission, like in [13], into a generalized splitting protocol,
Tsybakov and Likhanov reported the currently lowest known
upper bound of ≈ 0.568 in [18].
Of course, today we know that with MPR techniques,
physical layers can perform much better than the collision
channel model. Ghez, Verd´ and Schwartz [2] [3] were the
u
ﬁrst to analyze the S-ALOHA protocol and provided equations
to calculate its capacity over the general symmetric MPR
channel with inﬁnite population. Soon after, Mehravari [19]
studied a splitting algorithm for a speciﬁc MPR channel —
the N -user channel, that allows all transmissions to become
successful when there are N or less. Tsybakov, Mikhailov
and Likanov [20] also investigated the multiaccess capacity
for this channel, deriving lower and upper bounds for it.
In our earlier work [21], we provided conditions that the
general MPR channel satisﬁes for S-ALOHA to performing
optimally. We also proposed in [21] a genie-assisted protocol
that gives an upper bound to the capacity of general MPR
channels, although that protocol does not guarantee the FCFS
policy, which should be essential for a fair multiple access
protocol. The upper bound that we derive here will enforce
this important policy. Note that the results in [2], [3] and [19]
are rates of reliable data transmission that can be attained by
protocols; as such, they represent lower bounds on the capacity
of MPR channels. Other than [21] and this paper, no other
upper bounds have previously been reported for the general
MPR channel.
We should also contrast our paper’s focus with many recent
ones in the MPR literature. They investigate the performances
of having MPR for speciﬁc multiple access schemes (eg.
when used with power control) or certain network topologies
(eg. multi-hop networks) or speciﬁc multiuser physical layers.
Whereas, we extend from the classical approach to ﬁnd the
fundamental multiple access performance over the general
MPR channel with only the representative “0/1/e” feedback,
i.e. knowledge of whether the channel was idle in the previous
time slot or that it had successful or failed transmission(s).

Poisson point process over the real time line, with mean
measure equal to the unit rate λ scaled by the Lebesgue
measure, where λ is ﬁnite.
We employ the symmetric MPR channel model of [2], with
which the successful reception probabilities depend only on
the number of packets transmitted in the slot. For the inﬁnite
population scenario, given that n packets are transmitted, for
1 ≤ n ≤ ∞, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, let
Cn,k = P [k packets are correctly received| n are transmitted].
Clearly, the symmetric MPR channel model is a generalized
formulation and embodies as a special case the classical
collision channel, which has C1,0 = 0 and Cn,0 = 1 for all
n > 1.
We denote the expected number of packets correctly received from a transmission set of n STAs by
n

Cn

kCn,k ,
k=1

and assume that its limit C = limn→∞ Cn exists, which is
usually the case in practice [2]. For instance, it is natural
to expect C = 0 because practical PHY layers have ﬁnite
resources and hence cannot support an unbounded number of
simultaneous transmissions. We deﬁne channel capacity to be
Cmax

max Cn

1≤n≤∞

namely the maximum number of successes possible over
all numbers of simultaneous transmissions for a given MPR
channel.
In addition, we also assume that Cn is concave in n, a
property possessed by reasonable MPR channels. To see why,
say we have n1 < n2 < arg supn Cn . Then it is unreasonable
to expect Cn1 > Cn2 < Cmax because, if the channel is
still capable of supporting more successful receptions even
when greater than n2 STAs transmit, then we should have
Cn1 ≤ Cn2 . Similarly, say arg supn Cn < n3 < n4 , then we
should have Cn3 ≥ Cn4 , because the channel can only yield
fewer successes with an increasing number of transmitting
STAs if there already are greater than arg supn Cn of them. It
is possible for supn Cn to be achieved at more than one n, but
with the concavity assumption this must occur over one and
only one consecutive set of n’s.
We remark that, staying true to the channel’s symmetric nature, we assume those stations with packets received correctly
are selected randomly in an equiprobable fashion from the
transmission set, i.e., that each station in the set has probability
k/n to have transmitted successfully. Consequently, we see
that it is not possible for an MPR channel to enforce ﬁrst-inﬁrst-out (FIFO); however, we can still design our protocol to at
least be FCFS, i.e., that the packets may not necessarily leave
the system in the order they arrived, but their transmissions
will be attempted simultaneously with or no later than packets
that arrived after them.
Now let the set

P ROPERTIES OF MPR C HANNELS
The network model we consider is the same as that used
in the literature and the works mentioned in Section I.A. In
particular, we consider a network with an unbounded number
of terminals contending to transmit data packets to a central
base station. Our network uses a slotted-time system in which
transmissions may begin only at the start of a slot and that
every terminal is synchronized to the slots. We also assume
packet transmissions are of constant length lasting the entire
slot.
Each terminal in this inﬁnite population model can have up
to one packet to be transmitted at any time, be it a newly
arrived packet or a so-called backlogged packet that needs to
be retransmitted. Our packet arrival model is a homogeneous

rates achievable by protocols. In an MPR environment, an
illustrative performance measure is also how efﬁciently a
protocol utilizes the offered capacity. Accordingly we deﬁne a
protocol’s efﬁciency to be its maximum throughput divided by
the channel capacity (see also [19]). Interestingly, because the
channel capacity for the collision channel is one, a protocol’s
throughput is then also its efﬁciency; thus, during all this time,
in all the prior work listed above for the collision channel,
they have in fact been examining the efﬁciencies of random
multiple access protocols as well!

Note that when Cmax equals to inﬁnity, then n = ∞. Also,
the minimum in (1) signiﬁes that it is not necessary to enable
a larger group of active stations than n∗ in order to achieve
Cmax .
The probabilistic reception nature of MPR channels actually
presents a challenge in designing appropriate multiple access
protocols. This is because the channel’s random outcome
statistics are repeatable only after inﬁnite trials, via the law
of large numbers, as pointed out in [22]. Thus, unlike the
collision channel, after a transmission, an MPR receiver may
still be uncertain of whether there are any remaining active
stations even when no transmission attempts are detected.
Nonetheless, despite this probabilistic nature, note that there
is still a deterministic aspect to the reception outcome of a set
of concurrent transmissions. If Cn,k = 1 for some n ≥ 1
and some 1 ≤ k ≤ n, then we will know with certainty that
the event of k successes has occurred, since it does so with
probability one. Unfortunately unless Cn,k = 1 occurs at a
unique k for all n, we are still unable to deduce how many
active stations transmitted. But when there are exploitable
patterns as to where Cn,k = 1, we can be sure of some speciﬁc
events; this is in fact key to our derivations below.
For example, consider the N -user MPR channel that has
Cn,n = 1 for all n less than some number, N . Such a channel
can emulate many spread spectrum systems used in practice
in which multiuser detection can perform satisfactorily only
when the SIR is below a certain level. If such a system detects
no successes but sees evidence of transmission attempts,
then it is certain at least N active stations have transmitted.
Because of this property, we will refer these channels as the
deterministic N -user MPR channels.
Formalizing this deterministic property: We see that for all
MPR channels, there exists an

III. U PPER B OUND OF C APACITY BY A G ENIE - AIDED
P ROTOCOL
In deriving an upper bound of the capacity for the collision
channel, Molle [14] employed a helpful “genie” that provides
information about the arrival process at no extra cost. A cycle
begins when there are no known active stations and the genieaided protocol enables a number of arrival points. Any active
station at an enabled point will broadcast its packet. The cycle
is complete and ends if among these enabled points there are
no active stations or if there is only one active station, whose
packet will have been transmitted correctly. When there are
more than one active stations, then a collision has resulted
and the genie publicly points out the locations of the next two
closest and unknown active arrival points, which the protocol
enables each separately (and successfully), thus ending the
cycle. In the case of the Poisson limit, this is equivalent to the
protocol enabling an interval in the arrival process. The optimal genie-aided protocol, which evidently is both FCFS and
FIFO, enables the number of arrival points or interval length
that maximizes throughput. Clearly, this obtained throughput
is an upper bound to any unaided protocols because the genieaided version can always discard the extra information to
simulate any unaided protocols and achieve their throughputs.
However, when using this approach, it is critical to choose
a genie that is not “overly helpful”, otherwise the results
would not be too meaningful. For example, as discussed in
[14], consider a genie that labels the activeness of all the
arrival points. In the collision channel, a protocol can then
achieve perfect channel utilization (i.e., a throughput of one)
by enabling each known active points separately.
Though, it may not be entirely trivial to achieve the channel
capacity on the MPR channel even with such a propitious
genie. We pointed out in [21] that the upper bound of the MPR
channel’s capacity achieved with this genie is Cmax , when n∗
number of stations transmit each time. And consequently, if
C = Cmax for an MPR channel, then S-ALOHA with openloop control is already optimal because it attains the channel
capacity of Cmax in those conditions [21].
In light of this result, the quest for the MPR multiaccess
capacity remains only for cases where Cmax > C. Towards
that end, we generalize Molle’s method [14] to ﬁnd an upper
bound by selecting a similar but suitable genie for the MPR
channel.
Although his genie was designed speciﬁcally for the collision channel, interestingly we can observe that after a collision

(2)

where we adopt the notation that C0,0 = 1. Observe that the
collision channel is a special case of this with n0 = 1; the
deterministic MPR channel discussed above has n0 = N . Or
for example, a collision channel in the presence of noise that
can corrupt the packet has n0 = 0. Note also that n∗ ≥ n0 ≥ 0
for all the channels we are considering here. As it turns out n0
is an important variable in MAC design for an MPR channel
as it helps characterize the randomness of an MPR channel. In
the sections below, we will use the properties in n0 to upper
bound the MPR multiaccess capacity.
In general, we deﬁne a multiple access protocol to be stable
if it can maintain a ﬁnite number of backlogged unserviced
stations with probability one. An achievable throughput of
a protocol is a packet arrival rate that it can sustain while
keeping the system stable. By Little’s theorem [23], this arrival
rate is in fact also the rate at which packets are delivered when
the system is at equilibrium (i.e., steady state). We deﬁne the
capacity of a system to be the supremum over all throughput

has incurred the genie actually labels the next n0 + 1 = 2
active arrival points, which is in fact the least amount of active
points (or information) to expose that would keep the original
interval’s Poisson distribution unchanged in the remaining
interval. We call this effect return to fresh Poissonness. And
an analogous and more generalized form is also displayed in
the MPR environment, as captured by Lemma 1 below. We
will denote by |[a1 , a2 ]| to be the number of arrival points in
the closed interval [a1 , a2 ]; similar notation applies for open
and semi-open intervals.
Lemma 1: In a homogeneous Poisson point process with
intensity λ > 0 on some interval [a, b], when conditioned on
the events that, (i) in another non-overlapping interval [c, d],
where d < a, there is known to be L0 number of points; (ii)
|[a, b]| > n0 − L0 ≥ 0; (iii) the locations of L1 ≥ 0 of these
points in [a, b], U = {u1 , . . . , uL1 }, where u1 < · · · < uL1 ,
are known; and (iv) there is some a ≤ t < b such that there
are L2 ≥ 0 number of points in [a, t]\U, with L1 + L2 ≥
n0 +1−L0 , then the number of points in the remaining interval
of (t, b]\U is still Poisson distributed with intensity λ.
Proof: Because interval [c, d] is disjoint from [a, b], it has
no effect on the statistics of (t, b]\U other than the condition
it has L0 points. Since events (iii) and (iv) imply the event
|[a, b]| > n0 − L0 , P (|(t, b]\U| = j | |[a, b]| > n0 −
L0 , U, |[a, t]\U| = L2 ) = P (|(t, b]\U| = j | U, |[a, t]\U| =
L2 ). For j ≥ 0,

genie should not label any new points in [a, b], which remains
identically Poisson distributed from the protocol’s point of
view. Else, the genie should label all the unknown arrival
points from a up to t, and the protocol knows that the interval
from t onwards is identically Poisson distributed. In both
cases, the genie re-labels any of the L0 points in [c, d] that
are still backlogged after their enablement.
The remaining issue now is how the protocol should proceed with the genie-labelled active points to deliver the best
throughput. From the properties established in Section II, we
see that the optimal genie-aided protocol should always enable
n∗ points as often as possible in a cycle. Therefore, when there
are at least n∗ known arrival points, the protocol should enable
the earliest n∗ of these. (Note that the maximum number of
known points at any given time when employing this genie
can only be n∗ + 1, since n∗ ≥ n0 .) And, when there are less
then n∗ known arrival points, in order to uphold the FCFS
policy, the protocol should enable all of these known points
along with a new interval. Observe that our protocol and genie
here is a generalization of Molle’s protocol and genie for the
collision channel, where n∗ = n0 = 1 and L0 = L1 = 0.
Let random variables B and W be the the number of successes netted and expected number of transmissions expended
by the protocol for a cycle. The throughput expression and
performance for our genie-aided protocol is as follows.
Theorem 1: The throughput of our genie-assisted protocol
is E[B]/E[W ], with

P (|(t, b]\U|=j | U, |[a, t]\U| = L2 )
P (|(t, b]\U| = j, U, |[a, t]\U| = L2 )

Since (t, b]\U, [a, t] and U are disjoint subsets of [a, b], the
events |(t, b]\U| = j, U and |[a, t]\U| = L2 are all mutually
independent. Thus, P (|(t, b]\U| = j, U, |[a, t]\U| = L2 ) =
P (|(t, b]\U| = j)P (U, |[a, t]\U| = L2 ) = P (|(t, b]\U| =

(5)

for 1 ≤ i ≤ n∗ − 1 and n∗ > 1,

since the Lebesgue measure of U is zero.
Essentially Lemma 1 provides a guideline for the genie to
disclose locations of the arrival points yet still maintaining the
same Poisson distribution in the remainder of the interval. As
long as we can ascertain that the transmission set from an
enabled interval [a, b] has more than n0 − L0 arrival points,
then the genie can do so by labelling all the arrival points up to
t. This is true too when there are L1 of the |[a, b]| arrival points
successfully transmitted. It’s also true even when L0 known
backlogged arrival points (possibly from a previously enabled
interval [c, d]) is enabled simultaneously with [a, b]. And the
smallest number of arrival points that the genie can provide
while accomplishing this is L2 = max{n0 + 1 − L0 − L1 , 0}.
Since we will know the number of successful arrival points
from an enablement, then together with the genie’s action
the protocol can ascertain whether |[a, b]| > n0 − L0 and
act accordingly. Namely, if L0 + L1 ≥ n0 + 1, then the

The maximum throughput attainable by our protocol is the
maximum of E[B]/E[W ] over all x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0.
The derivation of (3)-(11) follows directly from the property
of the MPR channel, the actions of the genie and the corresponding protocol as we discussed. The maximum follows
from the fact that E[B]/E[W ] is a convex combination over
x and y. (A more detailed explanation is provided in [24].)
Note that by substituting the collision channel’s parameters
(i.e., n∗ = n0 = 1 and L0 = L1 = 0) into (3)-(11), we can
obtain Molle’s capacity expression in [14].
With Theorem 1, we can derive the capacity upper bound for
the N -user MPR channel. In Fig. 1 we plot this upper bound
and other known results for this channel. Note that among
the various bounds shown here, only the S-ALOHA protocol
and our genie-aided upper bound have the distinction of being
applicable for the general MPR channels. We report additional
investigation on the capacity and efﬁciencies bounds for other
MPR channels and their implications to the theory in [24].
