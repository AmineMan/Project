Translation association schemes, poset metrics, and
the shape enumerator of codes

Marcelo Firer∗∗

In this paper we restrict our attention to the case X = Fn ,
q
an n-dimensional linear space. Let d(·, ·) be a metric on X
that is invariant by translations. We denote by G = GLd (n)
the group of linear isometries of X with respect to d. This
group is formed of linear operators T : X → X such that
d(T (x), T (y)) = d(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X. The action of G
deﬁnes an equivalence relation on X × X where x ∼ y if
they belong to the same orbit, i.e. there is T ∈ G such that
T (x) = y. Let X := X/∼ be the set of orbits (equivalence
classes), |X | = s+1. Consider the partition R = {Rα |α ∈ X }
of X × X given by

Abstract—Poset metrics form a generalization of the Hamming
metric on the space Fn . Orbits of the group of linear isometries
q
of the space give rise to a translation association scheme. The
structure of the dual scheme is important in studying duality of
linear codes; this study is facilitated if the scheme is self-dual. We
study the relation between self-duality of the scheme and that of
the poset. We also give new examples of poset metric spaces and
describe the association schemes that arise from linear isometries.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A. Association schemes and duality
MacWilliams-type relations between weight enumerators of
additive codes and their dual codes can be derived using Delsarte’s theory of association schemes. We brieﬂy summarize
the facts about association schemes used below (this section
is mostly adopted from [2, ch. 2]). Given a ﬁnite space X, a
symmetric association scheme A(X, R = (R0 , R1 , . . . , Rs ))
is a partition of the set X × X into s classes such that
(i) R0 = {(x, x), x ∈ X},
(ii) if (x, y) ∈ Ri then (y, x) ∈ Ri for all x, y ∈ X,
(iii) there are numbers pk such that for any (x, y) ∈ Rk the
ij
number of z ∈ X with (x, z) ∈ Ri and (y, z) ∈ Rj
equals pk .

The matrices Ai generate an (s+ 1)-dimensional commutative
C-algebra A (the Bose-Mesner algebra of A). This algebra has
a basis of primitive idempotents (Ei , i = 0, 1, . . . , s). Deﬁne

The numbers vi = p0 and mi = rk Ei are called the valencies

and the multiplicities of the scheme A.
Suppose that X has the structure of an abelian group. A
scheme A is called a translation association scheme if for all
R∈R
(x, y) ∈ R ⇒ (x + z, y + z) ∈ R,

= {z ∈ X|(x, z) ∈ Rα and (y, z) ∈ Rβ }.

Consider another pair (x , y ) ∈ Rγ . There exists T ∈ G such
(x,y)
that T (x − y) = x − y . Let z ∈ pαβ , then (x, z) ∈ Rα
and (y, z) ∈ Rβ . We shall prove that (T (x), T (z)) ∈ Rα and
(T (y), T (z)) ∈ Rβ . By deﬁnition of Rα there is S ∈ G such
that S(x − z) = a1 − a2 . Then

Theorem 1: The pair (X, R) forms a translation association
scheme A with s classes.
Proof : We need to check the deﬁnition of the association
scheme. The subsets Rα , α ∈ X form a partition because ∼ is
an equivalence relation on X and hence a partition of X × X.
Property (i) follows because every T ∈ G is invertible and
linear, so T (x) = 0 iff x = 0.
Property (ii) (symmetry) follows because G is a group, and
so T ∈ G iff T −1 ∈ G.
Let us verify the intersection property (iii). Let (a1 , a2 ) and
(b1 , b2 ) be representatives of the classes α and β, respectively.
Given (x, y) ∈ Rγ denote

The adjacency matrix Ai of the class Ri is deﬁned by
(Ai )xy = 1(x,y)∈Ri ,

α ∈ X.

so (T (x), T (z)) ∈ Rα . Similarly, (T (y), T (z)) ∈ Rβ . It
(x,y)
(x ,y )
follows that there is an injective map T : pαβ → pαβ
−1
Similarly, T
deﬁnes an injective map in the reverse direc(x,y)
(x ,y )
tion, and so |pαβ | = |pαβ |. The translation property of
the scheme follows from the corresponding property of the
metric.
In this paper we consider association schemes of the kind
described by this theorem. A translation association scheme A
has a dual scheme A∗ deﬁned by the characters of the group
X. A character χ : X → C∗ is a homomorphism from X
into the multiplicative group of complex numbers. Characters

form a multiplicative group X ∗ with the operation given by
(χ1 χ2 )(x) = χ1 (x)χ2 (x). It is well known that X and X ∗ are
canonically isomorphic as groups. Consider the natural action
of A on X ∗ induced by the action of the incidence matrices:
Aα χ =

(x1 , x2 , . . . , xs ), where xi = (xi1 , . . . , xim ) for all i. Then
ωP (x) = i max(j : xi,j = 0), where the sum is extended
to the indices of the nonzero blocks xi . The group of linear
isometries is found in [7] (it consists of permutations of chains
followed by multiplication by upper-triangular matrices of order m with nonzero main diagonal). An important observation
is that the group G is not transitive on spheres of a given
P-radius about 0. To make the action transitive, deﬁne the
shape of the vector x ∈ X by shape(x) = (e1 , e2 , . . . , em ),
where ei is the number of chains whose rightmost nonzero
entry is in position i in the chain, counting from the left.
Clearly ωP (x) = i iei . For instance, let m = 3, s = 4, and
x = (010 100 110 111), then shape(x) = (1, 2, 1). We also
have ωP (x) = | x | = 8.
Let Ne = {x ∈ X| shape(x) = e} be an e-sphere in X.
The action of G is transitive on Ne for every e. Thus, the
association scheme A(X, R) is formed by the classes Re =
{(x, y) ∈ X ×X| shape(x−y) = e} for all e. The NRT metric
space X and its association scheme are also called the ordered
Hamming space (scheme). It can be shown [8] that relations
in the dual scheme A⊥ are deﬁned by the shapes that follow
the order of the dual poset P⊥ (the weights are measured
from the right rather than from the left). The parameters and
eigenvalues of the scheme A were further studied in [1].

eigenvalues P ∗ = Q, Q∗ = P.

Let C ⊂ X be a linear code. The dual code of C is
the subgroup C = {χ ∈ X ∗ |χ(x) = 1 for all x ∈ C}.
Even though X ∼ X ∗ , the codes C and C live in different
=
association schemes that are not necessarily isomorphic. If
the “linear-dual” code C ⊥ is deﬁned with respect to an inner
product on X × X, then identiﬁcation of C ⊥ and C does not
always preserve the association scheme. This distinction is not
apparent for the Hamming scheme but becomes important in
other cases.

Example 3. Suppose that [n] = 1≤k≤s Vk , where i j iff
i ∈ Vk1 , j ∈ Vk2 for some k1 < k2 , and the elements within
each Nk form an antichain. This order deﬁnes a hierarchical
poset. The group of linear isometries acts transitively on Pspheres, and the MacWilliams relations can be written with
respect to the weight enumerators of codes (this is also the
only poset metric for which this is possible) [6].
The case s = 1 corresponds to the Hamming space. The
case |V1 | = · · · = |Vs | = 1 corresponds to a single-chain
poset, which is also hierarchical.

B. Poset metrics
Suppose that the set of coordinates [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n} is
equipped with a partial order P. An order ideal is a subset I ⊂
[n] such that i ∈ I and j i imply that j ∈ I. The P-support
of a vector x ∈ X is deﬁned as the smallest ideal supp(x)
that contains all the nonzero coordinates of x. The P-norm
of x is deﬁned as ωP (x) = | supp(x) |. Brualdi et al. [3]
proved that the function dP (x, y) = ωP (x − y) is a translation
invariant metric on X. We denote the poset metric space over
X = Fn by (X, dP ). The association scheme deﬁned by linear
q
isometries of X (2) is denoted by A(X, RP ) or simply AP .

Deﬁnition 1. Let P be a poset on [n]. Deﬁne the dual order
P⊥ on [n] by setting i j iff i j in P.
Poset-metric automorphisms. A permutation π on the set [n]
is called an automorphism of the poset P if the action of π
preserves the order relations. Denote by SP the automorphism
group of P. For instance, for the Hamming space SP = Sn
(the symmetric group on n elements) while for a single chain
SP = {id}. A poset P is called self-dual if it is isomorphic
to its dual P⊥ , i.e., if there exists a permutation on [n] such
that if i P j then π(j) P⊥ π(i). To give an example, let
us represent P by its Hasse diagram in which the vertices
correspond to elements of [n] and i
j if the vertex i is
below the vertex j and is connected to it by an edge.

Example 1. The Hamming metric is obtained when P is an
antichain (no two coordinates are comparable). The group of
linear isometries consists of permutations and multiplications
by a nonzero constant, i.e., is a semi-direct product G =
(F∗ )n Sn . The orbits of G deﬁne the Hamming association
q
scheme which gives rise to many results of classical coding
theory.
Example 2. Suppose that n = ms, and the set [n] is a
disjoint union of s chains of length m (a chain is a totally
ordered set). The P-norm thus arising is called the NRT
weight [11]. To give an explicit deﬁnition, write x ∈ X as

Of the two posets in this ﬁgure the left is self-dual while
the right is not. The NRT poset is self-dual, including the case
of the single chain [8].
Groups of linear isometries of poset metric spaces (X, dP )

were computed in [9]. They are formed of poset automorphisms combined with linear transformations on X that preserve the P-support of vectors.

The converse claim will follow from the next proposition.
Proposition 3: Let P and Q be two posets deﬁned on [n].
Consider the metric spaces (X, dP ) and (X, dQ ) and let GP
and GQ be their groups of linear isometries. Suppose that the
translation association schemes AP and AQ deﬁned by the
groups GP and GQ are isomorphic. Then the poset-metric
spaces (X, dP ) and (X, dQ ) are isometric and the posets P
and Q are isomorphic.
Proof : The proof is by induction on n. The base case n = 1
is straightforward. Suppose that the statement is true for every
pair of posets P and Q deﬁned on [n − 1]. Let P and Q be
posets deﬁned on [n] and suppose that AP ∼ AQ . In other
=
words, there is a linear isomorphism φ : X → X such that
(x, y) ∈ RP,i if and only if (φ(x), φ(y)) ∈ RQ,π(i) for some
bijection π between the indices in RP and RQ . Consider a
basis β = {e1 , . . . , en } of X such that supp(ei ) = {i}. Since
φ is an isomorphism, it follows that {φ(e1 ), . . . , φ(en )} is a
basis of X.
Consider the poset metric space on Fn induced by the
q
poset Q and the linear isomorphism φ. Namely, for a vector
x = i αi φ(ei ) deﬁne the weight ωQ,φ (x) = | {i|αi = 0} Q |
where . Q refers to the smallest Q-ideal that contains the subset argument. Deﬁne the distance dQ,φ (x, y) = ωQ,φ (x − y).
Observe that the poset metric spaces (X, dQ ) and (X, dQ,φ )
are isometric, so the association schemes RQ and RQ,φ are
isomorphic.
Denote by δP (i, j) the graphical distance between i and j in
−
the Hasse diagram of P and let JP (i) := {j ∈ [n]|δP (i, j) =
1}. Let i by a maximal element in P and suppose wlog that
i = n (an element i ∈ [n] is called maximal if there does not
exist j ∈ P such that i ≺ j). Suppose moreover (again wlog)
−
that j = n − 1 ∈ JP (n), then en−1 ∈ en . Then there is a
P-isometry that takes en = (en +en−1 )−en−1 to en −en−1 . It
follows that the pairs (en−1 , en ) and (en−1 , en−1 +en ) belong
to the same class RP,[en ] ∈ RP . Letting fi = φ(ei ) for all i,
we conclude that the pairs (fn−1 , fn ) and (fn−1 , fn + fn−1 )
belong to the same class RQ,[fn ] ∈ RQ . Therefore, there is an
isometry that sends fn to fn−1 and (n − 1) Q n. Moreover,
−
clearly n − 1 ∈ JQ (n) because φ is a linear invertible map.
The claim now follows by the induction hypothesis.

II. D UALITY
Two s-class association schemes A(X, R) and B(X , R )
are called isomorphic if there is a bijection φ : X → X
such that (x, y) ∈ Ri if and only if (φ(x), φ(y)) ∈ Rπ(i) for
some ﬁxed permutation of the indices in R . If A and B are
translation schemes, then φ agrees with the translations.
A translation association scheme A(X, R) and its dual
scheme A∗ (X ∗ , R∗ ) are not always isomorphic. If they are,
then the scheme A is called self-dual. The main result of this
section is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 2: Suppose that A is a translation association
scheme on X whose classes are given by orbits of the group
G of linear isometries of a poset-metric space (X, P). If P is
self-dual then A ∼ A∗ . Conversely if A∗ ∼ A(X, RP⊥ ) then
=
=
P is self-dual.
Proof: Let α ∈ X be an orbit of G. For x ∈ X denote
by χx ∈ X ∗ its image under the isomorphism X ∼ X ∗ . We
=
have χx (y) = ω (x,y) , where ω is a primitive qth degree root
n
of unity and (x, y) = i=1 xi yi .
The “if” part will be established if we ﬁnd a bijective
map φ : X → X ∗ such that (x, y) ∈ Rα if and only if
∗
(χφ(x) , χφ(y) ) ∈ Rπ(α) , for some ﬁxed permutation π of the
orbits. Let τ be a permutation on [n] that maps P to P⊥ and
let Tτ be the corresponding n × n permutation matrix. The
matrix Tτ deﬁnes a linear isometry on X. Put φ = Tτ and
˜∗
˜∗
consider the sets Rα = {(χφ(x) , χφ(y) )|(x, y) ∈ Rα }, Nα =
{χφ(x) |x ∈ Nα }, α ∈ X . Consider the matrices

III. S ELF - DUAL POSETS FROM REGULAR TREES , AND
SHAPES OF VECTORS

χχ† η (y)

Let A(X, R) be an s-class translation association scheme
and let C ⊂ X be a linear code. We deﬁne the inner distribution of C as the vector (a0 , a1 , . . . , as ) where ai = |C ∩ Ni |
for all i. The inner distribution of the dual code is the vector
(a0 , a1 , . . . , as ), where ai = |C ∩ Ni∗ | for all i. These two
distributions are related by the MacWilliams equations: a =
|C|
1
|C| aQ, a = |X| a P. This offers a combinatorial motivation
for the study of inner distributions of codes in poset metric
spaces.
As before, consider a poset metric space (X, P) with the
translation association scheme (X, R) generated by the orbits
of the group of linear isometries. In our case, the sets Nα , α ∈
X are the orbits of GP . Generally, more than one index is

needed, and the generating function of the inner distribution
a becomes a multivariate polynomial. To give an example,
consider the NRT poset metric space. The orbits are given by
spheres of a ﬁxed shape e = (e1 , . . . , em ). Let ae = |{x ∈
C ∩ Ne }| be the number of vectors in C of a given shape,
then the shape enumerator of C is written as

poset-metric space. The following lemmas, proved using the
characterization of linear isometries [9], are needed to establish
the results.
Lemma 4: Let x ∈ M(X). Then there is a linear isometry
T ∈ GP0 such that T (x) = x.
˜
Lemma 5: Let x, x ∈ M(X) and suppose that ωP (x) =
ωP (x ). Then there is a linear isometry T ∈ GP0 such that
T (x) = x .
Lemma 6: For any x ∈ X there is a linear isometry T ∈
GP0 such that T (x) = x.
˜
These results enable us to give the following deﬁnition.

(the variable z0 is introduced to make the polynomial homogeneous). The MacWilliams relations for the ordered Hamming
space connect the enumerators BC and BC by deﬁning a linear
transformation of the variables (z0 , z1 , . . . , zr ) that changes
BC to BC [4]. In communication theory, the shapes characterize performance of linear codes when used on transmission
channels with certain domination structure [10].
Since the poset norm does not distinguish between the
values of nonzero coordinates, shapes are essentially invariants
of ideals rather than vectors. Our goal in this section is
to derive an explicit description of orbits for several new
examples of posets. Recall that an inﬁnite p-regular rooted
tree T is a tree in which all vertices but one have degree
p + 1, and the distinguished vertex (the root) has degree p. A
regular rooted tree Tm with m + 1 levels is obtained by taking
the subtree of T formed of the vertices connected to the root
by paths of length at most m.

Deﬁnition 2. Let x ∈ (X, P0 ) be a vector. The shape of x is
deﬁned by shape(x) = (a0 , a1 , . . . , am ), where ai = |M (x)∩
Hi | for all i.
The main result for the poset space (X, P0 ) is given by the
following theorem.
Theorem 7: Let x, x ∈ (X, P0 ) be two vectors. Then
shape(x) = shape(x ) if and only if there exists T ∈ GP0
such that T (x) = x .
This theorem shows that the action of GP0 is transitive
on shape-spheres. Therefore the relations of the association
scheme A(X, RP0 ) (orbits of GP0 ) can be labelled by (m+1)tuples of the form a = (a0 , a1 , . . . , am ), 0 ≤ ai ≤ pi , i =
0, 1, . . . , m. Not all such vectors a can be realized as shapes.
This follows because if I, J are ideals in P0 then either
I ∩ J = ∅ or one of them is a subset of the other. Therefore,
for instance if a0 = 1, then a1 = · · · = am = 0. In the full
form, this argument results in the following proposition.
Proposition 8: The shape vectors (a0 , a1 , . . . , am ) are given
by (m + 1)-vectors of integers that satisfy

Example: A non-self-dual poset. We begin with an example
in which the shapes are easier to describe than in the self-dual
cases below. Consider the poset P0 given by a rooted regular
tree Tm in which the root is the unique maximal element (an
up-rooted tree). In the next example p = 2, m = 2:

0 ≤ ai ≤ pi − pi a0 − pi−1 a1 − pi−2 a2 − · · · − pai−1

for all i = 0, 1, . . . , m.
A(X, RP0 ) are given by

Deﬁne the poset metric space X = (Fn , P0 ) where the
q

dimension equals the number of vertices, n = p p−1 . We
identify [n] with the set

where a = (a0 , a1 , . . . , am ) ranges over the set of shape
vectors.
This proposition characterizes the relations of the translation
scheme deﬁned by the poset-metric space (X, P0 ). We have
[2, p.45] the following orthogonality relations for the Qeigenvalues of A :

∈ Zp }.

This gives a natural grading on P0 where Hm = ∅ and
Hm−i = { 1 2 . . . i | j ∈ Zp , 1 ≤ j ≤ i} for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Assume that the vertices within the levels are labelled in a
coordinated way so that the order given by P0 can be written
as follows: two elements a, e ∈ [n], a = (α1 α2 . . . αs ), e =
( 1 2 . . . r ) satisfy e ≺ a iff s < r and αj = j , j = 1, . . . , s
(i.e., the label of vertex a is a preﬁx in the label of vertex
e). For a vector x ∈ X let x = xi if i ∈ M (x) and
˜
xi = 0 otherwise, where M (x)
Max( supp(x) ) is
the set of maximal elements in the support of x. Clearly
x
ωP (˜) = ωP (x).
We say that x ∈ X is mono-maximal if |M (x)| = 1 and let
M(X, P0 ) denote the set of mono-maximal elements of the

where the sum extends to all possible shapes and mb = rk Eb
is the multiplicity value of the scheme. Investigating properties of the eigenvalues implied by this orthogonality is an
interesting open question.
Self-dual posets: Turning to the main topic of this section,
we consider three types of graded self-dual posets: a lattice
formed by two p-regular trees Tm glued by the leaves, a poset
obtained by gluing two trees Tm by the root, and a tree and
its inverse next to each other. In the ﬁgure below, these posets

are labelled P1 , P2 , P3 respectively (p = 2). The main result
in this part is characterizing the orbits of GPi , i = 1, 2, 3 on
(X, Pi ) in terms of shapes of vectors. We have the following
statement.
Theorem 9: For i = 1, 2, 3 let x, x ∈ (X, Pi ) be two
vectors. Then shape(x) = shape(x ) if and only if there exists
T ∈ GPi such that T (x) = x . For each of the poset spaces
(X, Pi ) the shape of the vector is deﬁned below.

P1

P3

P2

Poset P1 : p-ary tree with two roots. From the Hasse diagram
we see that P1 has one minimal element and one maximal
element. As before, we have a natural grading of the poset P1 ,
⊥
⊥
⊥
and denote the levels of the grading by H0 , H1 , . . . , Hm−1 ,
⊥
⊥
Hm = Hm , Hm−1 , . . . , H1 , H0 , where the Hi correspond
to the levels of the inverted tree, and the Hi to the “usual”
tree. Clearly |Hi | = |Hi⊥ | = pi . The total number of levels
is 2m + 1, and the metric space X = Fn is of dimension
q
n = m−1 2|Hi | + |Hm | = (pm+1 + pm − 2)/(p − 1). We
i=1
use the labelling
H = {∅, Δ} ∪ { 1 , Δ|
∪ {Δ,

1 2

...

m−1 | j

1

∈ Zp } ∪ · · · ∪ {

1 2 . . . m , Δ| j

∈ Zp } ∪ · · · ∪ {Δ,

1| 1

∈ Zp

· · · <L er . Deﬁne the sequence
S(x) = (μ1 , δ1 , μ2 , δ2 , . . . , μr−1 , δr−1 , μr )
where μi = l(ei ) and δi = l(ei+1 ) − l(pr(ei , ei+1 )).
Deﬁnition 3: The shape of a vector x ∈ (X, P1 ) is deﬁned
as shape(x) = (u0 , u1 , . . . , um |v0 , v1 , . . . , vm ), where ui =
{j|μj = i} and vi = {j|δj = i} for all i.
This deﬁnition gives a characterization of the orbits of GP1
on X in terms of the shape of the vectors. The MacWilliams
relations for linear codes in (X, P1 ) are written with respect
to shape enumerators expressed by polynomials in 2m + 2
variables. Investigating the rank function of the code in linearalgebraic terms (similarly to the NRT case [10]) is another
open question.
Poset P2 : The dimension n of the metric space (X, P2 ) is
the same as in the previous example. Let H + be the upper part
of the Hasse diagram and H − be its lower part (they intersect
by their common root). Let x ∈ X, then Max(supp(x)) ⊆ H −
or Max(supp(x) ⊆ H + . Suppose it is the former. Then deﬁne
shape(x) = shape− (x), where shape− is given by Deﬁnition
2. Otherwise Max(supp(x)) ⊆ H + , and we deﬁne shape+ (x)
by ﬂipping the ordering in the arguments leading to Def. 2.
Finally, put shape(x) = shape+ (x) or shape− (x) depending
on which of the two cases is realized. We prove that Theorem
9 is true for the shape thus deﬁned. We also compute the
parameters of the association scheme A(X, R) where the
classes in R are indexed by the shapes.
Poset P3 : Consider the metric space (X, P3 ). Let H + refer
to the right of the two copies of the tree Tm (the uprooted
tree) and H − to the left one. Given a vector x ∈ X, we
deﬁne its partial supports as supp+ (x) and supp− (x) in an
} obvious way. Then Theorem 9 holds true if we put

∈ Zp } ∪ {Δ, ∅}

where the label sets correspond to the levels of the poset in
the above order, and Δ is a formal symbol used to distinguish
between Hi and Hi⊥ .
It is not difﬁcult to describe the order P1 using these labels.
⊥
⊥
Namely, if e ∈ Hr , a ∈ Hs , e = 1 2 . . . r ; a = α1 α2 . . . αs
(the Δ’s are discarded), then e ≺ a iff s < r and the word
α1 α2 . . . αs is a preﬁx in e. The situation e ∈ Hs , a ∈ Hr is
⊥
handled analogously, and if e ∈ Hr , a ∈ Hs , then e ≺ a iff
either e is a preﬁx in a or a is a preﬁx in e.
Now we use the labels to deﬁne a lexicographic order on
X. Let pr(a, b) be the common preﬁx of labels a and b and let
⊥
l(a) = r if a ∈ Hr or 2m−r if a ∈ Hr . Let a = α1 α2 . . . αr ,
b = β1 β2 . . . βs (the Δ’s are again discarded). Then we write
a <L b if one of the following takes place:
1. If a ∈ Hr and b ∈ Hs , then αl(pr(a,b))+1 ≤ βl(pr(a,b))+1
(the ﬁrst symbol of a after the common preﬁx relative to b is
less than the corresponding symbol of b, or if a = pr(a, b)
(i.e., a ≺ b);
⊥
⊥
2. If a ∈ Hr and b ∈ Hs , then αl(pr(a,b))+1 ≤ βl(pr(a,b))+1
or b = pr(a, b).
⊥
3. If a ∈ Hr and b ∈ Hs , then αl(pr(a,b))+1 ≤ βl(pr(a,b))+1 .
To deﬁne the shape of a vector x ∈ X suppose that the set
Max(supp(x)) = {e1 , e2 , . . . , er } is ordered as e1 <L e2 <L

shape(x) = (shape+ (supp+ (x)); shape− (supp− (x))).
