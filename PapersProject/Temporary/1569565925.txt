The coordinates of u ∈ Σn are indexed by elements of Zn ,
so that u = (u0 , u1 , · · · , un−1 ).
A pair-vector over Σ is a vector in (Σ × Σ)n . For any
u = (u0 , u1 , · · · , un−1 ) ∈ Σn , the symbol-pair read vector of
u is the pair-vector (over Σ)

Abstract—We study (symbol-pair) codes for symbol-pair read
channels introduced recently by Cassuto and Blaum (2010). A
Singleton-type bound on symbol-pair codes is established and
inﬁnite families of optimal symbol-pair codes are constructed.
These codes are maximum distance separable (MDS) in the sense
that they meet the Singleton-type bound. In contrast to classical
codes, where all known q-ary MDS codes have length O(q), we
show that q-ary MDS symbol-pair codes can have length Ω(q 2 ).
We also construct equidistant cyclic MDS symbol-pair codes from
Mendelsohn designs.

π(u) = ((u0 , u1 ), (u1 , u2 ), · · · , (un−2 , un−1 ), (un−1 , u0 )).
Obviously, each vector u ∈ Σn has a unique symbol-pair read
vector π(u) ∈ (Σ × Σ)n . However, not all pair-vectors over
Σ have a corresponding vector in Σn .
Let u, v ∈ (Σ×Σ)n . The pair-distance between pair vectors
u and v is deﬁned as

I. I NTRODUCTION
Symbol-pair coding theory has recently been introduced by
Cassuto and Blaum [1], [2] to address channels with high write
resolution but low read resolution, so that individual symbols
cannot be read off due to physical limitations. An example of
such channels is magnetic-storage, where information may be
written via a high resolution process such as lithography and
then read off by a low resolution technology such as magnetic
head.
The theory of symbol-pair codes is at a rather rudimentary
stage. Cassuto and Blaum [1], [2] laid out a framework for
combating pair-errors, relating pair-error correction capability
to a new metric called pair-distance. They also provided
code constructions and studied decoding methods. Bounds
and asymptotics on the size of optimal symbol-pair codes are
obtained. More recently, Cassuto and Litsyn [3] constructed
cyclic symbol-pair codes using algebraic methods, and showed
that there exist symbol-pair codes whose rates are strictly
higher, compared to codes for the Hamming metric with the
same relative distance.
This paper continues the investigation of codes for symbolpair channels. We establish a Singleton-type bound for
symbol-pair codes and construct MDS symbol-pair codes
(codes meeting this Singleton-type bound). In particular, we
completely settle the existence of MDS symbol-pair codes of
length n with pair-distance d, for 2 ≤ d ≤ 4 and d = n.
We also construct q-ary MDS symbol-pair codes of length
n and pair-distance n − 1 and n − 2, where n can be as
large as Ω(q 2 ). In contrast, the lengths of nontrivial classical
q-ary MDS codes are conjectured to be O(q). In addition,
we provide a new construction for equidistant cyclic MDS
symbol-pair codes based on Mendelsohn designs.

Dp (u, v) = |{i ∈ Zn : ui = vi }|.
The pair-distance between two vectors in Σn is the pairdistance between their corresponding symbol-pair read vectors, and if u, v ∈ Σn , we write Dp (u, v) to mean
Dp (π(u), π(v)). Cassuto and Blaum [2] proved that (Σn , Dp )
is a metric space, and showed the following relationship
between pair-distance and Hamming distance DH .
Proposition 2.1 (Cassuto and Blaum [2]): For u, v ∈ Σn
such that 0 < DH (u, v) < n, we have
DH (u, v) + 1 ≤ Dp (u, v) ≤ 2DH (u, v).
In the extreme cases in which DH (u, v) = 0 or n, we have
Dp (u, v) = DH (u, v).
A (q-ary) code of length n is a set C ⊆ Σn . Elements
of C are called codewords. The code C is said to have pairdistance d if Dp (u, v) ≥ d for all distinct u, v ∈ C, and
we denote such a code by (n, d)q -symbol-pair code. The size
of an (n, d)q -symbol-pair code is the number of codewords
it contains. The maximum size of an (n, d)q -symbol-pair
code is denoted Ap (n, d). An (n, d)q -symbol-pair code having
q
Ap (n, d) codewords is said to be optimal. The size of an
q
optimal symbol-pair code satisﬁes the following Singletontype bound.
Theorem 2.1: (Singleton Bound) Let q ≥ 2 and 2 ≤ d ≤ n.
Then Ap (n, d) ≤ q n−d+2 .
q
Proof: Let C be an (n, d)q -symbol-pair code with q ≥
2 and 2 ≤ d ≤ n. Delete the last d − 2 coordinates from
all the codewords of C. Observe that any d − 2 consecutive
coordinates contribute at most d −1 to the pair-distance. Since
C has pair-distance d, the resulting vectors of length n − d + 2
remain distinct after deleting the last d − 2 coordinates from
all codewords. The maximum number of distinct vectors of

length n − d + 2 over an alphabet of size q is q n−d+2 . Hence,
Ap (n, d) ≤ q n−d+2 .
q

Theorem 3.2 (Blanchard [5]–[7]): Let 2 ≤ d ≤ n. Then
there exists an MDS (n, d)q -code for all q sufﬁciently large.

Hence, an (n, d)q -symbol-pair code of size q n−d+2 is
optimal by Theorem 2.1 and we call such a symbol-pair
code maximum distance separable (MDS). In this paper, we
construct new inﬁnite classes of MDS symbol-pair codes.

This implies that for 2 ≤ d ≤ n, MDS (n, d)q -symbol-pair
codes exist for all q sufﬁciently large.
B. MDS Symbol-Pair Codes from Interleaving Classical MDS
Codes

III. C ONSTRUCTIONS OF MDS S YMBOL -PAIR C ODES

We use the interleaving method of Cassuto and Blaum
[2] to obtain MDS symbol-pair codes. Cassuto and Blaum
showed that a symbol-pair code with high pair-distance can
be obtained by interleaving two classical codes of the same
length and distance.

In this section, we give several methods for deriving MDS
symbol-pair codes from classical MDS codes. We also provide
direct constructions for MDS symbol-pair codes. Note that
C = Σn is an MDS (n, 2)q -symbol-pair code for all n ≥ 2
and q ≥ 2, so we consider codes of pair-distance at least three.

Theorem 3.3 (Cassuto and Blaum [2]): If there exist an
(n, d)q -code of size M1 and an (n, d)q -code of size M2 , then
there exists a (2n, 2d)q -symbol-pair code of size M1 M2 .

A. MDS Symbol-Pair Codes and Classical MDS Codes
Recall that a classical MDS (n, d)q -code, is a q-ary code
of length n with Hamming distance d and size q n−d+1 . Exploiting the relationship between pair-distance and Hamming
distance, we develop some general constructions for MDS
symbol-pair codes and determine the existence of all such
codes with pair-distance three.

Applying Theorem 3.3 with classical MDS codes gives the
following.
Corollary 3.2: If there exists an MDS (n, d)q -code, then
there exists an MDS (2n, 2d)q -symbol-pair code.

Proposition 3.1: An MDS (n, d)q -code with d < n is an
MDS (n, d + 1)q -symbol-pair code.
Proof: Let C be an MDS (n, d)q -code of size q n−d+1 . By
Proposition 2.1, C has pair-distance at least d + 1. Therefore
C meets the Singleton bound of Theorem 2.1.

Hence, the following is an immediate consequence of Theorem
3.1 and Corollary 3.2.
Corollary 3.3:
(i) There exists an MDS (2n, 2n − 4)q -symbol-pair code for
all q = 2m , m ≥ 1 and n ≤ q + 2.
(ii) There exists an MDS (2n, 8)q -symbol-pair code for all
n = 2m , m ≥ 1 and n ≤ q + 2.
(iii) There exists an MDS (2n, 2d)q -symbol-pair code whenever q is a prime power, 3 ≤ d ≤ n − 1 and n ≤ q + 1.
(iv) There exists an MDS (2n, 4)q -symbol-pair code for all
n ≥ 2, q ≥ 2.

Existence of MDS (n, d)q -codes with d < n is provided
below (see [4]). These MDS codes arise mainly from ReedSolomon codes and their extensions.
Theorem 3.1:
(i) There exists an MDS (n, n − 2)q -code for all q = 2m ,
m ≥ 1 and n ≤ q + 2.
(ii) There exists an MDS (n, 4)q -code for all n = 2m , m ≥ 1
and n ≤ q + 2.
(iii) There exists an MDS (n, d)q -code whenever q is a prime
power, 3 ≤ d ≤ n − 1 and n ≤ q + 1.
(iv) There exists an MDS (n, 2)q -symbol-pair code for all
n ≥ 2, q ≥ 2.

C. MDS Symbol-Pair Codes from Extending Classical MDS
Codes
MDS symbol-pair codes obtained by interleaving necessarily have even length and distance. Furthermore, the length of
symbol-pair codes obtained is only a factor of two longer than
that of the input classical codes. In this subsection, we use
graph theoretical concepts to extend classical MDS codes of
length n to MDS symbol-pair codes of length up to n(n−1)/2.
We use standard concepts of graph theory presented by
Bondy and Murty [9] and assume readers’ familiarity.

The following corollary is an immediate consequence of both
Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 3.1.
Corollary 3.1:
(i) There exists an MDS (n, n − 1)q -symbol-pair code for
all q = 2m , m ≥ 1 and n ≤ q + 2.
(ii) There exists an MDS (n, 5)q -symbol-pair code for all
n = 2m , m ≥ 1 and n ≤ q + 2.
(iii) There exists an MDS (n, d)q -symbol-pair code whenever
q is a prime power, 4 ≤ d ≤ n and n ≤ q + 1.
(iv) There exists an MDS (n, 3)q -symbol-pair code for all
n ≥ 2, q ≥ 2.

Proposition 3.2: Suppose there exists an MDS (n, d)q -code
and there exists an eulerian graph of order n, size m and girth
at least n−d+1. Then there exists an MDS (m, m−n+d+1)q symbol-pair code.
Proof: Let G be an eulerian graph of order n, size m
and girth at least n − d + 1, where V (G) = Zn . Consider
an eulerian tour T = x0 e1 x1 e2 x2 · · · em xm , where xm = x0 ,
xi ∈ V (G), and ei ∈ E(G), for 1 ≤ i ≤ m. Let C be an MDS
(n, d)q -code and consider the q-ary code of length m,

In particular, Corollary 3.1(iv) settles completely the existence
of (n, 3)q -symbol-pair codes.
Blanchard [5]–[7] (see also [8, chap. XI, §8]) proved the
following asymptotic result.

C = {(ux0 , ux1 , . . . , uxm−1 ) : u ∈ C}.

2

We claim that C has pair-distance at least m − n + d + 1.
Indeed, pick any u, v ∈ C. Since DH (u, v) ≥ d, we have
|{x ∈ V (G) : ux = vx }| ≤ n − d. It follows that

For n ≥ 11, let n = 2 n/2 . Consider the complete
bipartite graph G = K2 n /4 ,2 n /4 . Then G is a graph of
order n , girth four and size M (n ) and in addition, G contains
an induced subgraph K4,4 . Replacing the induced subgraph
K4,4 with

|{i : (uxi , uxi+1 ) = (vxi , vxi+1 ), 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1}| ≤ n − d − 1,
since on the contrary there would exist at least n − d
edges {x1 , y1 }, {x2 , y2 }, . . . , {xn−d , yn−d } in E(G) such that
uxj = vxj and uyj = vyj for all 1 ≤ j ≤ n − d. But since the
number of vertices x ∈ V (G) such that ux = vx is at most
n − d, these n − d edges must induce a subgraph (of order
n − d) that contains a cycle of length at most n − d. This
contradicts our assumption that G has girth at least n − d + 1.
Consequently, Dp (u, v) ≥ m − n + d + 1. Finally, observe
that |C | = |C| = q n−d+1 , and hence C is an MDS symbolpair code by Theorem 2.1.

H9,14 or H9,16 ,
if n is odd,
H10,15 or H10,17 , otherwise,
yields an eulerian graph of order n, girth at least four with the
desired sizes.
Constructions of H9,14 , H9,16 , H10,15 and H10,17 are given
in the full version of this paper.
Corollary 3.4: Let q be a prime power, q ≥ 4. Then there
exists an MDS (n, n − 1)q -symbol-pair code whenever
(i) 2 ≤ n ≤ (q 2 − 7)/2 or n = (q 2 − 1)/2, for q odd;
(ii) 2 ≤ n ≤ (q − 2)(q + 3)/2 or n = q(q + 1)/2, for q even.
Proof: Follows from Corollary 3.1, Proposition 3.2, and
Proposition 3.3.

To apply Proposition 3.2, we need eulerian graphs of
speciﬁed order, size, and girth. However, little is known about
how many edges an eulerian graph with a given number of
vertices and given girth can have. Nov´ k [10], [11] proved
a
tight upper bounds on the number of edges in an eulerian
graph of girth four. Below, we establish the following results
on the size of a connected even graph of order n (of girth
three), and those of girth four.

Corollary 3.5: Let q be a prime power, q ≥ 5. Then there
exists an MDS (n, n − 2)q -symbol-pair code whenever
(i) 2 ≤ n ≤ N (q), or N (q) ≤ n ≤ N (q + 2) and n even,
for q odd;
(ii) 2 ≤ n ≤ q 2 /4 + 1, n = q 2 /4 − 1, for q even.
Proof: Follows from Corollary 3.1, Proposition 3.2,
Proposition 3.4, and Proposition 3.5.

Proposition 3.3: Let n ≥ 3 and M = n (n − 1)/2 . Then
there exists an eulerian graph of order n and size m, for n ≤
m ≤ M , except when m ∈ {M − 1, M − 2}.

These results show that in contrast to classical q-ary MDS
codes of length n, where it is conjectured that n ≤ q + 2,
we can have q-ary MDS symbol-pair codes of length n with
n = Ω(q 2 ).

Proposition 3.4: Let n ≥ 6. Then there exists an eulerian
graph of order n, size m, and girth at least four, for all m ≡
n mod 2, n ≤ m ≤ M (n), except when m = M (n) − 2.

D. Zq -linear MDS Symbol-Pair Codes with Pair-Distance
Four, Five and n

Idea of proofs for Proposition 3.3 & 3.4: An extremal
eulerian graph G with girth at least three (or four) of size M
(respectively, M (n)) can be constructed directly. Hamiltonian
cycles and cycles of appropriate lengths are then removed from
G to obtain eulerian graphs of the required sizes. It remains
to ensure that the subgraph remains connected after the cycles
are removed. Details are deferred to the full version of this
paper.

We give direct constructions for MDS (n, d)q -symbol-pair
codes for d ∈ {4, 5, n}. We remark that for even n, MDS
(n, 4)q -symbol-pair codes have been constructed in Corollary
3.3, and MDS (n, n)q -symbol-pair codes can be constructed
by interleaving classical repetition codes. Here, we construct
MDS (n, 4)q -symbol-pair codes and MDS (n, n)q -symbolpair codes for all n. Throughout this subsection, we assume
Σ = Zq . Besides being MDS, the codes constructed have Zq linearity.

For m ≡ n mod 2, we have the following.
Proposition 3.5:
(i) For even n ≥ 10, there exists an eulerian graph of order
n, girth at least four, and size m ∈ {M (n−2)−1, M (n−
2) + 1}.
(ii) For odd n ≥ 9, there exists an eulerian graph of order n,
girth at least four, and size m ∈ {M (n) − 1, M (n) − 3}.

Deﬁnition 3.1: A code C ⊆ Σn is said to be Zq -linear if
u + v, λu ∈ C for all u, v ∈ C and λ ∈ Zq .
As with classical codes, a Zq -linear code must contain the zero
vector 0. In addition, determining the minimum pair-distance
of a Zq -linear code is equivalent to determining the minimum
pair-weight of a nonzero codeword.

Idea of proof: For n ∈ {9, 10}, eulerian graphs with
girth four and the required sizes can be constructed directly.
Denote these graphs by Hn,m , where n is the order and m is
the size.

Deﬁnition 3.2: The pair-weight of u ∈ Σn is
wtp (u) = Dp (u, 0).

A code C ⊆ Σn is cyclic if its automorphism group contains
a cyclic group of order n. In other words, C contains a
codeword (u0 , u1 , . . . , un−1 ) if and only if it also contains
(u1 , u2 , . . . , un−1 , u0 ) as a codeword. In this section, we
present a construction for cyclic MDS symbol-pair codes. The
constructed codes turned out to be also equidistant.

extended to MDS symbol-pair codes using eulerian graphs of

where all known such codes have length O(q), we establish
that q-ary MDS symbol-pair codes can have length Ω(q 2 ).

DH (τi (u), τj (u)) = n,
DH ((i, i, . . . , i), (j, j, . . . , j)) = n,
DH ((i, i, . . . , i), τk (u)) = n − 1,
for 0 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 1, 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, and u ∈ B. By
Proposition 2.1, we have
Dp (τi (u), τj (u)) = n,
Dp ((i, i, . . . , i), (j, j, . . . , j)) = n,
Dp ((i, i, . . . , i), τk (u)) ≥ n.

(1)

It is, in fact, easy to see that equality always holds in inequality
(1). Also, no pair of distinct blocks in B cyclically contain a
common element of Σ × Σ. Hence Dp (τi (u), τj (v)) = n for
all 0 ≤ i, j < n and distinct u, v ∈ B. This shows that the
code C has pair-distance n.
The proof of Proposition 4.1 actually shows that a Mendelsohn design M(q, n) gives rise to a cyclic MDS (n, n)q symbol-pair code that is equidistant, one in which every pair
of distinct codewords is at pair-distance exactly n. Applying
Proposition 4.1 with Theorem 4.1 and Theorem 4.2 gives the
following.
Theorem 4.3:
(i) There exists an equidistant cyclic MDS (n, n)q -symbolpair code for all q ≡ 0, 1 mod n, as long as q is
sufﬁciently large.
(ii) There exists an equidistant cyclic MDS (p, p)p2 -symbolpair code for all odd primes p.
(iii) There exists an equidistant cyclic MDS (n, n)pr -symbolpair code for all r > 1 and odd primes p ≡ 1 mod n.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we established a Singleton-type bound for
symbol-pair codes and constructed inﬁnite families of optimal
symbol-pair codes. All these codes are of the maximum distance separable (MDS) type in that they meet the Singletontype bound. We also show how classical MDS codes can be
