second. The associated bandwidth expansion factor is
b = Wc /Ws channel uses per source sample. Given
b and the signal-to-noise ratios, a tradeoff between the
achievable distortion pairs at the two users is of interest.
Now consider a variation on this problem. Imagine
that we require a low distortion even when experiencing
a weaker channel but we are willing to wait longer,
i.e., observe more channel symbols before making a
reconstruction. That is, we have the option of trading
distortion for delay. In this setup, the transmitter continues broadcasting and each receiver continues listening
until the distortion is sufﬁciently small. Such a problem
can be modelled as an extension of the model considered
in [1]–[3] where each receiver has a different bandwidth
expansion factor.
In [4] a single server streaming model has been
introduced. A server wishes to communicate a source
sequence to a group of heterogeneous users over a broadcast channel. The underlying channels are modelled as
erasure channels and each user’s channel has a certain
loss probability. Furthermore each user is only interested
in retrieving a certain fraction of source packets. The
transmitter continuously broadcasts coded packets and
each receiver waits until it is able to retrieve sufﬁciently
many packets of the underlying source. While the focus
in [4] is to optimize the degree distribution of a rateless
codes for this application, it can also be formulated as a
joint source-channel coding problem for sending a binary
source over a binary erasure broadcast channel with an
erasure distortion measure [5]. In the present paper we
only focus on the Gaussian version of the problem.

Abstract—We study the problem of broadcasting a
Gaussian source over a Gaussian broadcast channel to
two users with individual source-channel bandwidth mismatches, under a quadratic distortion measure. Speciﬁcally
we study the tradeoff between the achievable distortion
pairs between the two users. The case when the bandwidthexpansion factors of the two users are identical has been
well studied in the literature and to our best knowledge
remains an open problem. Surprisingly, when the bandwidth expansion factors are different, we characterize a
range of values where both the users simultaneously attain
their point-to-point optimal distortion. Furthermore in the
high signal-to-noise ratio regime, this set includes nearly
all points where the weaker user has the higher bandwidth
expansion factor. In other cases, we propose an achievable
tradeoff between the distortion pairs.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Consider the problem of sending a bandlimited Gaussian source over an additive bandlimited Gaussian noise
channel. Suppose that we are unclear about the exact
channel noise variance, however we still require that
the encoder guarantees certain levels of reconstruction
quality depending on the channel noise actually realized
when the system is operational. For example, we design
a single encoder and require that it achieves a low distortion for low noise power while relaxing our requirements
and allowing for a higher distortion when experiencing
higher noise power. This problem has been treated in
the literature by considering a single transmitter that
in fact broadcasts simultaneously to multiple receivers,
each with different signal to noise ratios [1]–[3]. Given
that the source and channel bandwidths are Ws and
Wc (Hz) respectively, we typically sample the source
at a rate of 2Ws samples per second, and subsequently
encode the samples to be sent over the discrete-time
Gaussian channels at a rate of 2Wc channel uses per

II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
The problem is illustrated in Fig. 1. We consider a
memoryless stationary Gaussian source {S(i)}i=1,2,...

wish to communicate to two users. Denote the vector

Now as mentioned in Section I, we associate with
the ith user, a delay parameter bi ∈ [0, ∞), called the
bandwidth expansion factor. This represents the number
of channel uses per source symbol that are delivered over
the ith user’s channel. That is, the ith user requires that
at most bi · k channel uses be employed on his channel
before he reconstructs S k subject to his distortion constraint. Our problem is now deﬁned as characterizing
the achievable distortion region under a given pair of
bandwidth expansion factors as per the next deﬁnition.

III. A N I NNER B OUND FOR THE ACHIEVABLE
D ISTORTION R EGION
In this section, we propose several coding schemes
that collectively provide an inner bound for the achievable distortion region. Assume that N1 < N2 . Since the
performance of the Gaussian broadcast channel is identical to that of a degraded Gaussian broadcast channel
[6, p. 570], we will refer to user 1 as the strong user, and
user 2 as the weak user. We specialize our analysis and
focus on the case in which both users have bandwidth
expanded and the strong user has the more stringent
delay constraint, i.e., 1 < b1 < b2 . In this case, we
will ﬁnd particular values b∗ and b2 in Section III-A, for
1
which both users can simultaneously achieve distortions
that are point-to-point optimal. In particular, we say that
user i achieves his point-to-point distortion at bandwidth
∗
expansion factor bi , if he achieves a distortion Di given
by

(1)

where Zi (l) is the zero-mean additive Gaussian noise
observed at user i’s lth channel output. The channel is
memoryless in the sense that Zi (l) is drawn i.i.d. from
a N (0, Ni ) distribution.
Now although the length n channel input is broadcasted to both users, we will assume that due to each
user’s delay constraint, the ith user reconstructs the
source after observing only the ﬁrst ni channel input
symbols, denoted as X ni , where ni ≤ n. Speciﬁcally, we
have that n = max(n1 , n2 ). The reconstruction’s ﬁdelity
is measured with the squared error distortion

channel capacity for the weak user, i.e., C2 = 1 log(1 +

to see that with arbitrarily small probability of error, the
strong user has to listen to only k(b∗ − 1) channel uses

before being able to uniquely identify which codeword
was sent by joint-typicality decoding, where b∗ satisﬁes

∗
we use a slight abuse of notation and express Di as
a function of only bi . In the following sections, we
will parameterize the problem by ﬁxing any arbitrary
b2 , while considering the distortions of both users as we
vary b1 relative to b2 .
A. A Critical Bandwidth Expansion Value
Consider ﬁrst, the problem of coding entirely for the
weak user so that he achieves his point-to-point distortion at some b2 > 1. We will use a hybrid digital-analog
coding scheme as in [1]–[3]. We ﬁrst split our channel
block of length n = b2 k into a lower analog branch and
an upper digital branch which are to be concatenated
together, i.e., multiplexed in that order in time (see
Fig. 2). The digital branch is of blocklength k(b2 − 1)
and contains a coarse description of the source sequence
S k . Speciﬁcally, we perform vector quantization of the
source at average distortion DQ , which is set so that
the quantizer rate is equal to the weak user’s channel
capacity on the digital branch, i.e.,

Combining (4), (5), (6) and (7), we have that at b∗ , the
1
∗
strong user can in fact achieve distortion D1 = D1 (b∗ ).
1

Theorem 1. Let b2 > 1. Then for some b∗ satisfying (6),
1
∗
∗
the distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) = (D1 (b∗ ), D2 (b2 )) is
1
(b∗ , b2 ) achievable.
1
Again, it is worth mentioning that the result of both
users achieving their point-to-point distortion in Theorem 1 is not possible in the familiar problem where
b1 = b2 . Naturally, the question now arises as to what
the achievable distortions would be if we deviate from
these critical bandwidth expansion factors. We explore
this in the next two sections.

k
Denote the output of the source quantizer as SQ .
k
We subtract SQ from the source sequence S k , and the
resultant quantization error vector E k , is scaled and sent
over the analog branch, which has blocklength k.
At the receiver, the weak user demultiplexes the
analog and digital branches and ﬁrst recovers the coarse
description from the digital branch. He then obtains the
linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate of
ˆ
the quantization error E k from the analog branch, and
k
ˆ
ˆ
reconstructs the source sequence as S k = SQ + E k . It is
readily veriﬁed that this scheme is point-to-point optimal
for the weak user at b2 .
Now consider the strong user as all this transpires. He
also demultiplexes the analog and digital branches. That
is, he observes the ﬁrst k channel symbols and sets this
aside as the analog branch and then observes the next
k(b2 − 1) channel symbols as a digital branch. We note
however, that the strong user can actually listen to only
k(b∗ − 1) < k(b2 − 1) channel symbols after the analog
1
branch and yet still recover the coarse description.
In the digital branch, note that the encoder employs
a Gaussian codebook composed of 2k(b2 −1)C2 length
k(b2 − 1) codewords whose components are sampled

B. A Successive Reﬁnement Coding Scheme
In this section, we consider the case that the delay of
the strong user, b1 , is even stricter than that given by
b∗ , i.e., 1 < b1 < b∗ < b2 . In this case, we will use a
1
1
“successive reﬁnement” strategy consisting of the coding
scheme of Section III-A followed by Wyner-Ziv coding
to show that both users can still simultaneously achieve
point-to-point optimal distortions.
Now given that b1 < b∗ , we ﬁrst ﬁnd a ˜2 satisfying
b
1
(6) when b∗ and b2 are replaced by b1 and ˜2 respectively.
b
1
In other words, we ﬁnd a ˜2 such that k(b1 − 1)C1 =

Operationally, this is equivalent to employing the
coding scheme of Section III-A with a coarse de˜
scription that achieves distortion DQ using rate
˜
(1/2) log(σ 2 /DQ ) = (˜2 − 1) log(1 + P/N2 ). Here ˜2

is chosen as in (8) and from Theorem 1, we achieve

the point-to-point optimal distortions for both user 1 and
user 2 at b1 and ˜2 respectively. To show that we can also
b
be optimal for user 2 at b2 , we use Wyner-Ziv coding
immediately after the coding scheme of Section III-A.
Speciﬁcally, after k˜2 channel uses, we send a Wynerb
Ziv bit stream for the weak user assuming that he has
∗
side information at a mean squared error of D2 (˜2 ) with
b
respect to the source. Note here that we can invoke the
upper bound on the quadratic Wyner-Ziv rate-distortion
function as in [2], to show that in order to achieve a
new distortion of D2 , a bit stream of rate RWZ (D2 ) is
sufﬁcient, where

respectively. As the private message is intended only
for user 1, we can send it only over Region I. We
will dedicate a portion β ∈ [0, 1] of the total power in
Region I for this purpose. Speciﬁcally, we set

portion (1 − β) of the power in Region I will be used
for this purpose while the full power of Region II will
be used. Speciﬁcally, we perform vector quantization of

Combining (4) and (10) and rearranging for D2 , we
have that after sending the Wyner-Ziv bit stream, we can
∗
in fact achieve D2 = D2 (b2 ) at b2 .

Theorem 2. Let b2 > 1 and let b∗ satisfy (6) for the
1
choice of b2 . Then for any b1 such that 1 < b1 ≤ b∗ , the
1
∗
∗
distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) = (D1 (b1 ), D2 (b2 )) is (b1 , b2 )
achievable.
As an interesting aside, from (6) we have that in the
limit of high SNR (P ￿ N1 ), b∗ = b2 − oP (1) where
1
oP (1) goes to zero as P → ∞. Theorem 2 then states
that we can nearly achieve point-to-point optimality for
both users for any b1 < b2 under bandwidth expansion.

Equation (12) makes it clear that user 2 will be able
to recover the coarse description by treating the private
message as noise in Region I, and then recovering the
rest of the message in Region II. In order for user 1 to
also recover the message in Region I, we require that

After each user recovers the coarse description, they

branch, after which, user i can achieve distortion Di of

Since this is all we will be sending to the weak

user, D2 is the ﬁnal distortion user 2 achieves. We
will however, send extra Wyner-Ziv bits for user 1 in
Region I assuming that he already has side information
˜
at distortion D1 relative to the source. The extra bits help
user 1 achieve a distortion D1 , where we set D1 so that
the Wyner-Ziv rate equals the private message rate, i.e.,
˜

RWZ (D1 ) = log

Suppose for now that user 1 is to be optimal at b1 . In
this case, we see that (13) must be met with equality. To

C. An Achievable Tradeoff
In this section, we present an achievable tradeoff in
distortion pairs for when 1 < b∗ < b1 < b2 . We will
1
again use a hybrid-digital analog scheme, however this
time, we will further divide the digital branch (in time)
into two regions. Region I will include the channel uses
from k to kb1 while Region II will include the channel
uses from kb1 to kb2 (see Fig. 3). Following this division,
we now view the digital branch analogously to the
product of two unmatched degraded broadcast channels
[7]. Here, Region I corresponds to a degraded brodcast
channel in which user 1 is the stronger user, while
Region II corresponds to another broadcast channel in
which user 2 is the stronger user and user 1 has inﬁnite
noise power. We will use these two broadcast channels
to send a common message intended for both users, and
a private message intended only for user 1; cf. [2], [3].
We denote the common and private message rates,
measured in bits per source symbol, as R0 and R1

It can be veriﬁed that 0 < β0 < 1 whenever 1 < b∗ <
1
b1 < b2 , which is the region of interest and so β0 is
indeed a valid power allocation. Deﬁning the functions
D1 (β) and D2 (β) as in (16) and (17), after combining
(11), (12), (14) and (15) for user 1 and (12) and (14) for
user 2, we have that the distortion pair (D1 (β0 ), D2 (β0 ))
is achievable. In particular, since the right hand sides of
(12) and (13) are equal when β = β0 , we can conﬁrm
that user 1 is optimal at b1 for this power allocation.
Let us now consider the scenario if we did not require
user 1 to be optimal at b1 . To this end, we restrict β by
setting β = αβ0 for some α ∈ [0, 1]. In particular, if
α = 1, we recover β = β0 as our power allocation, and
user 1 is optimal. As we decrease α (and in turn β),
we introduce more slackness in (13) until β = 0. This
makes the coding identical to that in Section III-A, so
that the weak user is optimal. In general, we may achieve
a tradeoff in distortions by letting α vary in [0, 1].

We remark that as b1 → b2 , from (18) we have
that β0 → 1. In this case, Theorem 3 reduces to
the achievable scheme proposed in [2]. In light of the
results in [3] and [7] we also suggest that the results
of this section may be improved by further allocating
power amongst the analog and digital branches and subbranches, introducing a private message to user 2 and
optimizing over the boundaries of Regions I and II,
however for conciseness, we do not pursue this here.
Finally, we mention that the outer bound in [2] using
b = max (b1 , b2 ) = b2 , may also be applied here since
this bound would be obeyed a fortiori when b1 < b2 .
Theorem 3 completes our coding scheme for any b1
and b2 such that 1 < b1 < b2 . Fig. 4 plots our achievable
