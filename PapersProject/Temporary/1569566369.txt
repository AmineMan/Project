II. P RELIMINARIES

Abstract—Revisiting an approach by Conway and Sloane we
investigate a collection of optimal non-linear binary codes and
represent them as (non-linear) codes over Z4 . The Fourier
transform will be used in order to analyze these codes, which
leads to a new algebraic representation involving subgroups of
the group of units in a certain ring.
One of our results is a new representation of Best’s (10, 40, 4)
code as a coset of a subgroup in the group of invertible elements of
the group ring Z4 [Z5 ]. This yields a particularly simple algebraic
decoding algorithm for this code.
The technique at hand is further applied to analyze Julin’s
(12, 144, 4) code and the (12, 24, 12) Hadamard code. It
can also be used in order to construct a (non-optimal) binary
(14, 56, 6) code.

A. Codes over Z4
In the beginning of the 90s several optimal non-linear binary
codes were recognized as Gray images of Z4 -linear codes (see,
e.g., [6]). Since then codes over Z4 or over more general rings
gained much attention in the literature.
Deﬁne the Lee weight on Z4 by
wLee : Z4 → N ,

x → min{x, 4 − x} .

Setting δLee (x, y) = wLee (x − y), it turns out that (Z4 , δLee )
is isometric to (Z2 , δH ) via the Gray mapping
2
Z4 → Z2 ,

I. I NTRODUCTION
Let R be a ﬁnite ring and let δ be a metric on R, which is
additively extended to a metric on Rn . An (n, M, d)R,δ code
is a (not necessarily linear) subset of Rn having cardinality M
and minimum distance d with respect to the metric δ. Deﬁne
AR,δ (n, d) to be the maximum number M such that an
(n, M, d)R,δ code exists. A fundamental task in coding theory
is to determine for given n and d the number AR,δ (n, d),
and to ﬁnd a corresponding optimal code. In the following
we consider the case R = F2 and δ = δH , the Hamming
metric, or R = Z4 and δ = δLee , the Lee metric. We will
use the simpliﬁed notations (n, M, d) for (n, M, d)F2 ,δH and
(n, M, d)Z4 for (n, M, d)Z4 ,δLee .
The purpose of this paper is to provide further insight into
the algebraic representation of some optimal non-linear binary
codes. Our work is based on the quaternary constructions for
the Best code and the Julin code given by Conway and Sloane,
in fact, we take the algebraic representation in [3] a step further
in that we involve the multiplicative structure of the ambient
group ring. More speciﬁcally, we use the Fourier transform as
well as subgroups of the unit group of a group ring to analyze
the codes.
As a result, we obtain a new succint description of Best’s
(10, 40, 4) code as a subgroup coset in the unit group of
the ring. This representation gives rise to a novel algebraic
decoding algorithm for this code. We also apply this technique to analyze Julin’s (12, 144, 4) code and the (12, 24, 12)
Hadamard code. We further use it to construct a (non-optimal)
binary (14, 56, 6) code.

a + 2 b → a (0, 1) + b (1, 1) ,

where a, b ∈ {0, 1}. The componentwise extension of this
mapping to Zn yields an isometry between (Zn , δLee ) and
4
4
(Z2n , δH ).
2
We note that in order to view a (non-linear) binary code as
a linear code over Z4 it is necessary that its cardinality is a
power of 2. Here we are interested in codes that do not satisfy
this condition.
B. Group rings and the Fourier transform
A natural algebraic framework for cyclic codes is provided
by group rings. For a ﬁnite ring R the group ring R[Zn ] is the
set of all R-valued functions on Zn , equipped with the natural
addition and the multiplication that is given by the cyclic
convolution, i.e.,
(f

f (i) g(j − i) ,

g) (j) :=
i∈Zn

where f, g ∈ R[Zn ] and j ∈ Zn .
Letting δj , for j ∈ Zn , be the element in R[Zn ] deﬁned by
δj (j) = 1 and δj (i) = 0 if i = j, we can write any element
f ∈ R[Zn ] as a sum i∈Zn f (i)δi . The element f will also
be denoted sometimes by a vector (f (0), f (1), . . . , f (n−1)).
Using the concept of a group ring, a cyclic code of length n
over the ring R can be understood as a subset in R[Zn ] that
is closed under multiplication by the element δ1 .
Now we deﬁne the discrete Fourier transform and state its
fundamental properties (cf. [4]).

The (10, 40, 4) Best code cannot be recognized as a submodule over Z4 , since the cardinality is not a power of 2.
Nevertheless, it was observed by Conway and Sloane [3] that
the Best code has a sensible interpretation as a code over Z4 .
Namely, deﬁne a code P ⊆ Z5 consisting of all words

and all cyclic shifts of these. This code has parameters
(5, 40, 4)Z4 and is called the pentacode. It can be shown that
the Gray image of P is (up to equivalence) the (10, 40, 4)
code discovered by Best. Furthermore, the code P is invariant
under the automorphisms

III. T HE (10,40,4) B EST CODE
A. The original binary code
It is possible to prove AF2 ,δH (10, 4) ≤ 40 by a modiﬁcation
of the linear programming bound (see, e.g., [9, p. 541]).
Best [1] came up with the construction of a binary code
meeting this bound. This optimal binary (10, 40, 4) code
consists of the words

(a, b, c, d, e) → (−a, −b, −c, −d, −e) ,
(a, b, c, d, e) → (−a, 2 − b, c, 2 − d, −e) ,
(a, b, c, d, e) → (b, c, d, e, a) ,
(a, b, c, d, e) → (2 + e, 2 + d, 2 + c, 2 + b, 2 + a) .

C. Spectral analysis of the pentacode
In order to apply the Fourier transform, we chose to analyze
the pentacode, because Best’s original binary code does not
satisfy n ∈ F× . For this we ﬁnd that the Galois ring GR(4, 4)
2
as an extension of Z4 contains the required primitive 5-th root
of unity ω. The minimal polynomial of ω over Z4 is given by

together with all cyclic shifts of these. The distance enumerator
of Best’s code is given by
DH (x, y) = x10 + 22 x6 y 4 + 12 x4 y 6 + 5 x2 y 8 .
Its automorphism group is a semidirect product of the dihedral
group D5 and Z5 and hence has 320 elements. Litsyn and
2
Vardy [8] showed that Best’s code is unique, i.e., any binary
(10, 40, 4) code must be isometric to this code. Furthermore,
it can be shown (cf. [1], [3]) that applying the so-called
Construction A to the (10, 40, 4) code yields the densest sphere
packing known in 10 dimensions.

ϕω = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 .
We computed the Fourier transform of all words of the
pentacode. The result is shown in Table I. It is apparent that
the spectrum of each word of P solely consists of invertible
elements in GR(4, 4). We can further make the following

observation. Let
ˆ
f := ( 1 , 3 ω + 1 , 3 ω 2 + 1 , 3 ω 3 + 1 , 3 ω 4 + 1 )

U1 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0) ,
(3, 0, 0, 0, 0) ,
(1, 2, 0, 0, 0) ,
(1, 0, 0, 0, 2)

Then for each word c ∈ P there holds
ˆ ˆ
c = f · (−1)i · hj · g k
ˆ ˆ

for some i, j ∈ Z2 , k ∈ Z10 .

D. Algebraic representation
The preceeding observations lead to the following algebraic
structure of the pentacode. By applying the inverse transform
and doing some rescaling we obtain the vectors
g = (2, 1, 0, 0, 0) ,
h = (1, 2, 0, 0, 0) .
Here h2 = 1 and g is of order 10. This yields the following
theorem:
Theorem 6. Let f, g, h ∈ Z4 [Z5 ] be as above. For each word c
of the pentacode P there holds
(−1)i hj

E. A decoding algorithm
We present a simple decoding algorithm for the pentacode
which is based on its algebraic representation as f U in the
group ring. The decoding algorithm differs considerably from
the one given in [3].
In the following we will write f g for the convolution
f g in a group ring. For concreteness we consider in the
ring S = Z4 [Z5 ] the pentacode C = f2,1 U2 = f U ,
with f = (3, 3, 2, 1, 0) = (0, 1, 1, 1, 2)−1 ∈ C and U =
U2 = δ1 , −1, g, h , where g = (1, 0, 2, 0, 0) = 2δ2 + 1 and
h = (1, 0, 0, 2, 0) = 2δ3 + 1. Hence C is given as

gk

for some i, j ∈ Z2 and k ∈ Z10 . Consequently, the pentacode
is a coset
P = f U,
where U is a 40 element subgroup of the group of invertible
elements in the group ring S := Z4 [Z5 ].
One can prove that the ring S = Z4 [Z5 ] is isomorphic to
GR(4, 4) × Z4 , and hence the unit group S × is isomorphic to
Z4 × Z15 × Z2 ∼ Z5 × Z3 × Z5 (see [10]). From this it is easy
= 2
2
to see that there are 5 2 = 155 subgroups U of order 40 in
3
the unit group of S; here 5 2 denotes the Gaussian binomial
3
coefﬁcient, i.e., the number of 3-dimensional subspaces of
Z5 . By a computer search we found that only 2 of these
2
subgroups yield (up to equivalence) the pentacode. Moreover,
the pentacode occurs twice among the 12 cosets of each of
these two subgroups.
The four algebraic representations of the pentacode as
f U , where f ∈ S and U is a subgroup of S × , are given
in Table II. In each case, we state four generators of the
subgroup U , which have order 5, 2, 2, and 2, respectively,
and we chose the representative f to be of minimal degree
i
in the ‘polynomial’ representation i∈Zj f (i)δ1 . The original
pentacode P of Theorem 6 is found as f1,1 U1 ; for this, note
that g 5 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 2) and g 6 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0).
For each subgroup Uj , j = 1, 2, the pentacodes fj,1 Uj
and fj,2 Uj are related as fj,2 Uj = a fj,1 Uj , where
a = (3, 2, 2, 2, 2) ∈ Uj is a unit element; this element has the
/
property that the left multiplication
La : S × → S × ,

f2,1 = (3, 1, 0, 1, 0)
f2,2 = (1, 3, 0, 1, 0)

In fact, the set of s ∈ S such that Ls : S × → S × is an
isometry of the unit group S × equals δ1 , −1, a , whereas the
set of s ∈ S such that Ls : C → C is a code isometry equals
δ1 , −1 , for all four pentacodes C. In particular, not all left
multiplications of elements in Uj are isometries.
We note that [3] mentions also four pentacodes B0 , B1 , B2 ,
B3 , which are constructed as orbits of a group of isometries
on Z5 . Here, B0 equals f1,1 U1 and B2 equals f1,2 U1 ,
4
whereas B1 and B3 are different from f2,1 U2 and f2,2 U2 .

The following lemma gives a simple membership test for U .
Lemma 7. Let s ∈ S. Then s ∈ U if and only if
s≡δ
for some

mod 2 and δ− s = 2 (i + j δ2 + k δ3 ) + 1
∈ Z5 and i, j, k ∈ Z2 .

Proof: An element u ∈ U is of the form (−1)i g j hk δ =
(2 + 1)i (2δ2 + 1)j (2δ3 + 1)k δ = 2 (i + j δ2 + k δ3 ) + 1 δ ,
for some ∈ Z5 and i, j, k ∈ Z2 .
Given y ∈ S we can check whether y ∈ C = f U by
applying the test of Lemma 7 to z = f −1 y. In case y ∈ C
we also obtain this way the ‘message’ (i, j, k, ) ∈ Z3 × Z5 .
2
Now we present a decoding algorithm for the pentacode C.
Let y ∈ S be the received vector, and assume that y = c + e =
f u + e, where c ∈ C, u ∈ U , and e ∈ S is an error vector of
Lee weight ≤ 2. We note that f −1 = (0, 1, 1, 1, 2).
1) Compute z := f −1 y.
[In fact, z = u + f −1 e. Note that u ≡ δ mod 2, so
that wH (u mod 2) = 1. Furthermore, wH (f −1 e mod 2)
is odd if and only if wH (e mod 2) is odd.]

x→a x

is a wLee -isometry on the unit group S × .

3

2a) Case wH (z mod 2) odd: Check if z ∈ U by applying
Lemma 7. If yes, conclude that no error occurred,
and output the corresponding message (i, j, k, ); if no,
conclude that two errors occurred.
[Note that wH (e mod 2) is even.]

A. The (12, 144, 4) Julin code
Julin’s binary (12, 144, 4) code [7] (see also [9, p. 70f])
can be constructed by taking as words the 132 blocks of
a Steiner S(5, 6, 12) system and adding six words each of
weight 2 and 10. The code was shown to be optimal in [11].
Conway and Sloane [3] provided a quaternary construction for
a canonical version of the Julin code. In this construction one
deﬁnes the vectors

2b) Case wH (z mod 2) even:
[Note that wH (e mod 2) is odd, and hence e = ±δr
for some r ∈ Z5 . We thus have z = u ± δr f −1 , where
u = δ 2 (i + j δ2 + k δ3 ) + 1 for some ∈ Z5 and
i, j, k ∈ Z2 .]

Here e stands for an even element and o for an odd
element of Z4 .
[Note that f −1 = (0, 1, 1, 1, 2) and 2 (i+j δ2 +k δ3 )+1
is of the form (o, 0, e, e, 0).]

c11 = (3, 1, . . . , 1) c12 = (2, 0, . . . , 0) c13 = (0, 2, . . . , 2)
and let the quaternary Julin code J consist of all cyclic
shifts and negations of the vectors c1 , . . . , c13 . This code has
parameters (6, 144, 4)Z4 .
We performed a spectral analysis of the quaternary Julin
code J. Although n = 6 is not a unit in characteristic 4, the
Fourier transform provided us with enough information to ﬁnd
the following algebraic representation.
Let S be the group ring Z4 [Z6 ], and let g =
(0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) ∈ S which is an invertible element of order 2.
We consider the subgroup U of S × generated by −1, δ1 , and
g, which has 24 elements.
Then J is invariant under the group U ; it is actually a union
of 8 cosets of U . More concretely, J can be written as

Then δ− (z δr f −1 ) = 2 (i + j δ2 + k δ3 ) + 1 for some
i, j, k ∈ Z2 ; output the message (i, j, k, ).
It is not hard to see that the pattern given in the table
determine uniquely ∈ Z5 , r ∈ Z5 , and the sign of the error
e = ±δr . Thus, the decoding algorithm corrects all errors of
Lee weight 1 and detects all errors of Lee weight 2. This
shows again that the code has minimum Lee distance 4.

IV. I NVESTIGATION OF OTHER CODES

∪ c11 U .

The Gray images of Z4 -codes of the form f U , where f ∈
S = Z4 [Zn ] and U is a subgroup of the unit group S × , yield
good binary codes in many cases. For example, binary codes
with parameters (6, 4, 4), (8, 16, 4), (10, 40, 4), (12, 128, 4),
(14, 392, 4), (12, 24, 6), and (14, 56, 6) can be constructed this
way. In this section we study some of these cases as well as
the (12, 144, 4) Julin code in greater detail. We start with a
preliminary observation.

B. The (12, 24, 6) Hadamard code
The binary (12, 24, 6) binary Hadamard code (see, e.g., [9,
p. 49]) is constructed from a Hadamard matrix H of order 12,
and such a matrix can be obtained from the Paley construction.
The Hadamard matrix H is changed into a binary matrix A,
where +1 s are replaced by 0 s and −1 s by 1 s. Then the
Hadamard code consists of all rows of the matrix A, together
with their complements. From the deﬁnition of Hadamard
matrix the code has parameters (12, 24, 6), which can be seen
to be optimal by applying the Plotkin bound (see [9, p. 43]).
We now give an algebraic representation of a quaternary
(6, 24, 6)Z4 by using again the group ring S = Z4 [Z6 ].
Let U be the subgroup of S × generated by the elements
(2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), (0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3), and (2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0) of order 2,
as well as the element (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) of order 3. Then U
has 24 elements, and

Proposition 8. Let S := Z4 [Zn ], let f ∈ S and U ⊆ S × , and
let C := f U . Then the Lee distance between two codewords
of C is even, in particular the minimum Lee distance of the
code C is even.
Proof: Let Sodd := {f ∈ S | i f (i) ∈ Z× = {1, 3}}

and let Seven := S \ Sodd . By Corollary 5, U ⊆ S × ⊆ Sodd .
Case 1: f ∈ Sodd . Then from Lemma 4 it follows C =
f U ⊆ Sodd . Let c, c ∈ C ⊆ Sodd . Then i (c − c )(i) =
i c(i) −
i c (i) is even, so that c − c ∈ Seven . It follows
that wLee (c − c ) = i wLee (c − c )(i) is even.
Case 2: f ∈ Seven . Then from Lemma 4 it follows C =
f U ⊆ Seven . As before, for c, c ∈ C it follows c−c ∈ Seven
and thus wLee (c − c ) is even.

with f = (0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0) deﬁnes a (6, 24, 6)Z4 code. It can be
shown that the Gray map of C is a translation of a (12, 24, 6)
Hadamard code.

a similar way in the binary group ring Z2 [Z12 ].

as a useful tool when analyzing non-linear codes, and found
a presentation of certain optimal non-linear binary codes as
coset(s) of a subgroup in the unit group of a ring. It is an open
problem whether asymptotically good codes can be obtained
by this method.

C. A (14, 56, 6) code
We performed a computer search to obtain an interesting
heptacode. For this we took a similar avenue as for the Best
code and deﬁne:

which has 56 words and is of minimum Lee distance 6.
The code turns out to be distance-invariant and its distance
enumerator is given by
DLee (x, y) = x14 + 36 x8 y 6 + 7 x6 y 8 + 12 x4 y 10 .
The Gray image of H is a binary (14, 56, 6) code. Consulting Grassl’s tables [5] we ﬁnd that for a linear binary code
only the parameters (14, 25 , 6) are possible. From Brouwer’s
table [2] however we ﬁnd a strong competitor, namely the doubly shortened Nordstrom-Robinson code, which is a (14, 64, 6)
code.
We remark that by shortening the code H we get a code
with parameters (13, 28, 6), which are the same as for the socalled conference matrix code of length 13 (see [9, p. 57]).
C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper we provided new insights into the algebraic
representation of Best’s (10, 40, 4) code and other non-linear
binary codes. We established the discrete Fourier transform
