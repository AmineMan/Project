(CSS) construction [4, 13, 19] was extended to include codes
endowed with the Hermitian and also trace Hermitian inner
product. In [7, 17], asymmetric quantum MDS codes were
constructed, where in the ﬁrst paper the codes are derived from
generalized Reed-Solomon codes (GRS), and in the second
paper, the AQECC are non Reed-Solomon type. More recently,
in [15, 16], constructions of families of AQECC by expanding
GRS codes and by applying product codes, respectively, were
presented.
As it is natural, the investigation of AQECC has received
less attention when compared to QECC. Based on these
facts, we show how to construct new families of AQECC
by employing the quantum code expansion applied to linear
classical codes by means of the CSS construction. More
speciﬁcally, we construct new families of quantum generalized
Reed-Muller (GRM) codes, quadratic residue (QR), character,
BCH and quantum afﬁne-invariant codes by applying the CSS
construction.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II the required
preliminaries are given. Section III is devoted to establish the
construction of new families of AQECC. More precisely, we
utilize the asymmetric quantum code expansion applied to
(classical) generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) codes, quadratic
residue, character codes, BCH and afﬁne-invariant codes in
order to construct several new families of AQECC. Finally, in
Section IV, a summary of the paper is given.

Abstract—In this paper paper we apply the code expansion
to classical linear codes in order to construct new families of
asymmetric quantum error-correcting codes (AQECC) by means
of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction. The AQECC
are derived from (classical) generalized Reed-Muller (GRM)
codes, quadratic residue (QR), Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem
(BCH), character codes and afﬁne-invariant codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
To make reliable the transmission or storage of quantum
information against noise caused by the environment there
exist many works available in the literature dealing with constructions of efﬁcient quantum error-correcting codes (QECC)
over unbiased quantum channels [3, 4, 13, 21, 25]. Recently,
these constructions have been extended to asymmetric quantum channels in a natural way [1, 2, 6, 8, 11, 14–17, 22, 23, 26,
27]. Steane [24] was the ﬁrst author who introduced the
notion of asymmetric quantum errors. Asymmetric quantum
error-correcting codes (AQECC) are quantum codes deﬁned
over quantum channels where qudit-ﬂip errors and phaseshift errors may have different probabilities. The combined
amplitude damping and dephasing channel (speciﬁc to binary
systems; see [22]) is an example for a quantum channel that
satisﬁes dz > dx , that is, the probability of occurrence of
phase-shift errors is greater than the probability of occurrence
of qudit-ﬂip errors.
Let us give a brief summary of the papers available in the
literature dealing with AQECC. In [6], the authors explored
the asymmetry between qubit-ﬂip and phase-shift errors to
perform an optimization when compared to QECC. In [11]
the authors utilize BCH codes to correct qubit-ﬂip errors and
LDPC codes to correct more frequently phase-shift errors. In
[26] the authors consider the investigation of AQECC via code
conversion. In the papers [1, 14], families of AQECC derived
from BCH codes were constructed. Asymmetric stabilizer
codes derived from LDPC codes were constructed in [22], and
in [23], the same authors have constructed several families of
both binary and nonbinary AQECC as well as to derive bounds
such as the (quantum) Singleton and the linear programming
bound to AQECC. In [2], both AQECC (derived from cyclic
codes) and subsystem codes were investigated. In [27], the
construction of nonadditive AQECC as well as constructions of
asymptotically good AQECC derived from algebraic-geometry
codes were presented. In [8], the Calderbank-Shor-Steane

II. N OTATION
Throughout this paper, p denotes a prime number, q denotes
a prime power, Fq is a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements, α ∈ Fqm
is a primitive n root of unity. As usual, [n, k, d]q denotes a
(classical) linear code C over Fq , of length n, dimension k
and minimum distance d. We denote by wt(C) the minimum
weight of C, and by d(C) the minimum distance of C.
Sometimes we abuse the notation by writing C = [n, k, d]q .
The parameters [[n, k, dz /dx ]]q denotes the parameters of an
AQECC of length n, dimension k, where dz denotes the
minimum distance corresponding to phase-shift errors and dx
is the minimum distance corresponding to qudit-ﬂip errors.

Let us give a brief description of the section. In Subsection III-A we construct AQECC derived from generalized

The q-ary GRM code
[q m , k(α), d(α)]q , where

Reed-Muller (GRM) codes. In Subsection III-B, a family of
asymmetric quantum character codes is generated; Subsection III-C deals with construction of AQECC derived from
BCH codes, Subsection III-D presents new AQECC derived
from quadratic residue (QR) codes and, in Subsection III-E,
we construct new asymmetric stabilizer codes derived from
afﬁne-invariant codes.
Let us recall the well-known CSS construction:
Lemma 3.1: [4, 8, 13, 19](CSS construction) Let C1 and C2
denote two classical linear codes with parameters [n, k1 , d1 ]q
and [n, k2 , d2 ]q , respectively. Consider that
⊥
⊥
dx
=
min{wt(C1 \C2 ), wt(C2 \C1 )} and dz
=
⊥
⊥
max{wt(C1 \C2 ), wt(C2 \C1 )}. If C2 ⊂ C1 , then there
exists an AQECC with parameters [[n, K = k1 − k2 , dz /dx ]]q .
By applying the CSS construction we can deduce Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 3.3, that are useful results in order to
construct new AQECC. We omit their proofs due to lack of
space.
Theorem 3.2: Let q be a prime power and m ≥ 1 be
an integer. Assume there exists an AQECC with parameters
[[n, k, dz /dx ]]qm , where dz ≥ d1 and dx ≥ d2 , derived from
linear codes C1 = [n, k1 , d1 ]qm and C2 = [n, k2 , d2 ]qm by
applying the CSS construction. Then there exists an AQECC
with parameters [[mn, mk, d∗ /d∗ ]]q , where k = k1 − k2 ,
x
z
d∗ ≥ d1 and d∗ ≥ d⊥ , where d⊥ denotes the minimum
z

distance of the dual code C2 .
Corollary 3.3: Let q be a prime power and assume that
there exists an AQECC with parameters [[n, k, dz /dx ]]qm ,
where m ≥ 1 is an integer, dz ≥ d and dx ≥ d, derived from a
(Euclidean) self-orthogonal code C = [n, k , d]qm . If q is even
or q and m are odd, then there exists an AQECC with parameters [[mn, mk, d∗ /d∗ ]]q = [[mn, m(2k − n), d∗ /d∗ ]]q , where

and
d(α) = (t + 1)q u ,

(2)

where m(q − 1) − α = (q − 1)u + t and 0 ≤ t < q − 1. The
dual of a GRM code Rq (α, m) is also a GRM code given by
[Rq (α, m)]⊥ = Rq (α⊥ , m), where α⊥ = m(q − 1) − 1 − α.
We use the properties of GRM codes to derive more new
asymmetric quantum codes:
Theorem 3.4: Let 0 ≤ α1 ≤ α2 < m(q − 1) and assume
that q = pl is a prime power, where l ≥ 1. Then there exists
an p-ary asymmetric quantum GRM code with parameters
[[lq m , l[k(α2 ) − k(α1 )], dz /dx ]]p , where dz ≥ d(α2 ), dx ≥
⊥
d(α1 ), k(α2 ) and k(α1 ) are given in Eq. (1), d(α2 ) is given
⊥
in Eq. (2) and d(α1 ) = (a+1)q b , where α1 +1 = (q −1)b+a
and 0 ≤ a ≤ q − 1.
Proof: First, note that since the inequality α1 ≤ α2
holds then the inclusion Rq (α1 , m) ⊂ Rq (α2 , m) also
holds. Let β be a basis of Fq over the prime ﬁeld Fp
and β ⊥ its dual basis. Then one can expand the codes
Rq (α1 , m) and Rq (α1 , m) with respect to β obtaining, therefore, p-ary codes β(Rq (α1 , m)) and β(Rq (α2 , m)), satisfying β(Rq (α1 , m)) ⊂ β(Rq (α2 , m)). Expanding the dual
code [Rq (α1 , m)]⊥ with respect to β ⊥ one obtains the
⊥
p-ary code [β(Rq (α1 , m))]
= β ⊥ ([Rq (α1 , m)]⊥ ). The
codes β(Rq (α1 , m)) and β(Rq (α2 , m)) have parameters
[lq m , lk(α1 ), d(α1 )]p and [lq m , lk(α2 ), d(α2 )]p , respectively,
where k(α1 ) and k(α2 ) are computed according to Eq. (1)
and d(α1 ), d(α2 ) are computed by applying Eq. (2).
⊥
We know that the parameter α1 of the dual code
⊥
⊥
⊥
[Rq (α1 , m)] = Rq (α1 , m) equals α1 = m(q − 1) − 1 − α1 ,
⊥
so the minimum distance of [Rq (α1 , m)]⊥ is equal to d(α1 ) =
b
(a+1)q , where α1 +1 = (q−1)b+a and 0 ≤ a ≤ q−1. Thus
⊥
the code [β(Rq (α1 , m))] has minimum distance greater than
⊥
or equal to d(α1 ).
Applying the CSS construction to the codes β(Rq (α1 , m)),
⊥
β(Rq (α2 , m)) and [β(Rq (α1 , m))]
one can get an
[[lq m , l[k(α2 ) − k(α1 )], dz /dx ]]p asymmetric stabilizer
⊥
code, where dz ≥ d(α2 ) and dx ≥ d(α1 ).

A. Construction I- Reed-Muller codes
In this subsection we present a construction of AQECC
derived from generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) [12].
The generalized Reed-Muller (GRM) codes were introduced
by Kasami, Lin, and Peterson [12]. Such class of codes was
utilized by Sarvepalli and Klappenecker [20] for constructing
good nonbinary stabilizer codes by means of the CSS as well
as the Hermitian quantum code constructions. We utilize the
notation adopted in [20]. Let us recall the deﬁnition of GRM
codes:
We begin by considering an enumeration (P1 , P2 , . . . , Pn )
m
of the points of Fq (so n = q m ). As usual, the set
Lm (α) denotes the vector space (considered as a subspace of
Fq [x1 , . . . , xm ]) generated by polynomials of degree less than
or equal to α. The GRM code Rq (α, m) over Fq of order α
is deﬁned as

B. Construction II- Character codes
Here we construct asymmetric quantum codes derived from
(classical) character codes. The class of (classical) character
codes were introduced by Ding et al. [5]. These codes are
deﬁned by using the characters of groups; they are linear,
deﬁned over Fq and are similar (with respect to the parameters)
to binary Reed-Muller codes. Such class of codes was utilized
by Ketkar et al. [13] to construct stabilizer codes (see Theorem
68).
Let us recall the class of codes derived from character of a
given group. For more details the reader can consult [5]. We
utilize the same notation adopted in [5].

Rq (α, m) = {(f (P1 ), . . . , f (Pn ))|f ∈ Lm (α)},
where α is an integer such that 0 ≤ α < q(m − 1).

Given an abelian group (G, +) of order n and exponent
m. Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld such that gcd(n, q) = 1 and
m|(q − 1). Consider the group of characters (Γ, ·) from
∗
(G, +) into (Fq , ·), where the latter group is the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of Fq . Since (G, +) is
isomorphic to (Γ, ·), there exists a bijection g ∈ G −→
χg ∈ Γ. For every X ⊂ G, the character code denoted
by CX is the linear code over Fq deﬁned by CX =

by Aly [1, Theorem 8]. The parameters of these codes were
recently improved for some investigated families [14].
Recall that a cyclic code of length n over Fq is a BCH code
with designed distance δ if, for some integer b ≥ 0, one has
g(x) = l.c.m.{M (b) (x), M (b+1) (x), . . . , M (b+δ−2) (x)},
that is, g(x) is the monic polynomial of smallest degree over
Fq having αb , αb+1 , . . . , αb+δ−2 as zeros. The dimension k
of a BCH code equals k = n − deg g(x) and, from the BCH
bound, its minimum distance is greater than or equal to its
designed distance δ. In Theorems 3.7 and 3.8 we construct
new families of AQECC by means of (classical) BCH codes:
Theorem 3.7: Suppose that n = q m − 1, where q = pt is
a power of an odd prime p, t ≥ 1 and m ≥ 3 are integers
an integer (if q = 3, m ≥ 4). Then there exist quantum codes
with parameters
• [[tn, t(n − m(4q − 5) − 2), dz ≥ (2q + 2)/dx ≥ 2q]]p ;
• [[tn, t(n − m(4q − c − 5) − 2), dz ≥ (2q + 2)/dx ≥
(2q − c)]]p , where 0 ≤ c ≤ q − 2;
• [[tn, t(n − m(2c − l − 4) − 2), dz ≥ c/dx ≥ (c − l)]]p ,
where 2 ≤ c ≤ q and 0 ≤ l ≤ c − 2;
• [[tn, t(n − m(2c − l − 6) − 2), dz ≥ c/dx ≥ (c − l)]]p ,
where q + 2 < c ≤ 2q and 0 ≤ l ≤ c − q − 3;
• [[tn, t(n − m(4q − l − 5) − 1), dz ≥ (2q + 1)/dx ≥
(2q − l)]]p , where 0 ≤ l ≤ q − 2.
Proof: Omitted by lack of space.
Theorem 3.8: Let q = pt be a power of a prime p, t ≥ 1,
gcd(q, n) = 1 and ordn (q) = m. Then there exists an AQECC
with parameters [[tn, t(n − m (δ1 − 1)(1 − 1/q) − m (δ2 −
⊥
1)(1 − 1/q) ), d∗ /d∗ ]]p , where d∗ = wt(C2 \C1 ) ≥ δ2 and
z
x
z

dx = wt(C1 \C2 ) ≥ δ1 .

and

has parameters [n, k]q , where n = |G| and k = n − |X|.
If one considers the commutative group G = Zm , t ≥ 1
2
and a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq , where q = pl and p = 2 is prime, the
a·b
characters of G are given by χa (b) = (−1) , a, b ∈ G. Then
one deﬁnes the code Cq (r, m) = CX , where X ⊂ Zm consists
2
of elements with Hamming weight greater than r. The code
Cq (r, m) has parameters [2m , sm (r), 2m−r ]q (see [5, Theorem
6]), where

sm (r) =

The (Euclidean) dual code [Cq (r, m)] of Cq (r, m) is equivalent to Cq (m−r−1, m) (see [5, Theorem 8]) and consequently
has parameters [2m , sm (m − r − 1), 2r+1 ]q .
In [13] the authors constructed a family of stabilizer codes
derived from character codes:
Theorem 3.5: [13, Theorem 68] If 0 ≤ r1 < r2 ≤
m and q is a power of an odd prime, then there exists
an [[2m , k(r2 ) − k(r1 ), min{2m−r2 , 2r1 +1 }]]q quantum code,
r
m
.
where k(r) =
i
i=0
Here we utilize code expansion applied to character codes to
generate new AQECC, as established in the following theorem:
Theorem 3.6: If 0 ≤ r1 < r2 ≤ m and q = pt is a
power of an odd prime p, where t ≥ 1, then there exists
an [[t2m , t(k(r2 ) − k(r1 )), dz /dx ]]p AQECC, where k(r) =
r
m
and dz ≥ 2m−r2 and dx ≥ 2r1 +1 .
i
i=0
Proof: We know that Cq (r1 , m) ⊂ Cq (r2 , m) [13,
⊥
Lemma 66] and the dual code [Cq (r1 , m)] is equivalent
to the code Cq (m − r1 − 1, m). Similarly as was done
in the proofs of previous theorems, we consider β a basis
of Fq over Fp and β ⊥ its dual basis. We expand C1 =
Cq (r1 , m) and C2 = Cq (r2 , m) with respect to β and the
⊥
⊥
code C1 = [Cq (r1 , m)] with respect to β ⊥ . Applying
Theorem 3.3 of Part I and the CSS construction, one can get
an [[t2m , t(k(r2 ) − k(r1 )), dz /dx ]]p AQECC, where t, k(r1 ),
k(r2 ), dx and dz are speciﬁed in the hypothesis.

D. Construction IV- Quadratic Residue Codes
In this subsection we construct families of AQECC derived
from quadratic residue (QR) codes. A family of quantum
codes derived from classical QR codes by means of the CSS
construction was constructed in [13] (see Theorems 40 and
41).
Let us recall the basic concepts of this class of codes.
For more information we refer to [10, 18]. We follow the
terminology adopted in [10].
Let p be an odd prime. Recall that a nonzero square modulo
p is a nonzero integer t such that there exists an integer x
satisfying x2 ≡ t mod p. Throughout this subsection we
consider n (code length) be an odd prime not dividing q, where
q is a prime power that is a square modulo n. We consider
Q be the set of nonzero squares modulo n; Q is called the
nonzero quadratic residues modulo n. The set N consists of
non-squares modulo n and it is called quadratic non-residues
modulo n.
The quadratic residue codes Q, Q , N and N are
cyclic codes with generator polynomials q(x),
(x −
1)q(x), n(x), (x − 1)n(x), respectively, where

C. Construction III - BCH codes
In this subsection we construct more families of asymmetric
stabilizer codes derived from Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem
(BCH) codes by means of the CSS construction. The ﬁrst
families of AQECC derived from BCH codes were constructed

(x − αr ),

q(x) =
r∈Q

3

(x − αn )

n(x) =
n∈N

Expanding Q and Q⊥ with respect to β one obtains, respec⊥
tively, codes β(Q) and β(Q⊥ ) = [β(Q)] with corresponding
parameters [tn, t(n + 1)/2, d1 ≥ d]p and [tn, t(n−1)/2, d2 ≥
⊥
d ]p , where d2 − d + 1 ≥ n and d ≥ d. Since [β(Q)] ⊂
β(Q), applying the CSS construction to the self-orthogonal
code β(Q) one has an [[tn, t, dz /dx ]]p code, where dz ≥ d,
dx ≥ d and d2 − d + 1 ≥ n.

have coefﬁcients from Fq , and α is a primitive pth root of
unity belonging to some extension ﬁeld of Fq . The codes Q
and N are the even-like subcodes of Q and N , respectively.
The codes Q and N have the same parameters
2
[p, (p + 1)/2, d1 ]q , where (d1 ) ≥ p; similarly, the codes Q
and N also have the same parameters [p, (p − 1)/2, d2 ]q ,
2
where (d2 ) ≥ p.
If one examines more deeply Theorem 41 shown in [13],
one can rewrite it as follows:
Theorem 3.9: [13, Theorem 41] Let n be a prime of the
form n ≡ 1 mod 4, and let q be a power of a prime that
is not divisible by n. If q is a quadratic residue modulo n,
then there exists an [[n, 1, dz /dx ]]q asymmetric quantum code,
√
√
where dz and dx satisfy dz ≥ n and dx ≥ n.
Here we construct a family of AQECC derived from expansion of quadratic residue codes as follows:
Theorem 3.10: Let n be a prime of the form n ≡ 1 mod 4,
and let q = pt (t ≥ 1) be a power of a prime that is not
divisible by n. If q is a quadratic residue modulo n, then there
exists an [[tn, t, dz /dx ]]p asymmetric quantum code, where dz
√
√
and dx satisfy dz ≥ n and dx ≥ n.
Proof: Consider the codes Q, Q and N given above.
Since n = 4k + 1, then it is well known that Q = N ⊥ ,
so N ⊥ ⊂ Q. The codes Q and N ⊥ have parameters,
2
respectively, given by [n, (n + 1)/2, d1 ]q , with (d1 ) ≥ n
2
and [n, (n − 1)/2, d2 ]q , where (d2 ) ≥ n. Consider β be
a basis of Fq over its prime ﬁeld Fp . We expand Q and
N ⊥ with respect to β, generating therefore codes β(Q)
and β(N ⊥ ) with parameters [tn, t(n + 1)/2, D1 ≥ d1 ]p and
[tn, t(n − 1)/2, D2 ≥ d2 ]p , respectively. Proceeding similarly
as in the proof of Theorem 3.3 of Part I and applying the CSS
⊥
construction to the codes β(Q), β(N ⊥ ) and [β(N ⊥ )] , one
can get an [[tn, t, dz /dx ]]p asymmetric quantum code, where
√
√
dz and dx satisfy dz ≥ n and dx ≥ n.

E. Construction V- Afﬁne-Invariant codes
Afﬁne invariant codes [10] form an important class of
codes. We brieﬂy describe this class of codes in order to give
necessary preliminaries for our constructions. For more details,
see [10].
Let I be the extension ﬁeld Fqt of Fq (I will be the index
set for the extended cyclic code of length q t that will be
deﬁned below). The notation I ∗ denotes the nonzero elements
of I. Assume that α is a primitive nth root of unity in I.
Consider the algebra Fq [I] deﬁned by




Fq [I] =
ag X g |ag ∈ Fq , ∀ g ∈ I ,


g∈I

endowed with the usual operations given by
ag X g + d

c
g∈I

bg X g =
g∈I

g∈I

for each c, d ∈ Fq , and




ag X g  

g∈I

(cag + dbg )X g ,



bg X g  =

g∈I

ah bg−h
g∈I

Xg.

h∈I

0X g and the unity of Fq [I] is X 0 .

The zero of Fq [I] is
g∈I

Let C be a maximal cyclic code (that is, a cyclic code whose
deﬁning set contains one cyclotomic coset) over Fq of length
q t − 1, and consider a codeword c = (c0 , . . . , cn−1 ) of C with
corresponding polynomial c(x) = c0 + c1 x + . . . + cn−1 xn−1 .
We can associate the codeword c with an element C(x) ∈
Fq [I ∗ ] by

We next consider the following result shown in [13].
Theorem 3.11: [13, Theorem 40] Let n be a prime of the
form n ≡ 3 mod 4, and let q be a power of a prime that is
not divisible by n. If q is a quadratic residue modulo n, then
there exists an [[n, 1, dz /dx ]]q AQECC, where dz ≥ d, dx ≥ d
and d satisﬁes d2 − d + 1 ≥ n.
We can obtain more families of AQECC once one can
guarantee the existence of self-dual basis, as the next theorem
states:
Theorem 3.12: Let n be a prime of the form n ≡ 3
mod 4, and let q = pt (t ≥ 1) be a power of a prime
that is not divisible by n, where the prime p and t are odd.
If q is a quadratic residue modulo n, then there exists an
[[tn, t, dz /dx ]]p quantum code, where dz ≥ d, dx ≥ d and d
satisﬁes d2 − d + 1 ≥ n.
Proof: Recall that since p and t are odd, then there
exists a self-dual basis β of Fpt over Fp . Moreover, since
n = 4k − 1, the dual Q⊥ of Q equals Q⊥ = Q , so Q⊥ ⊂ Q.
The codes Q and Q⊥ have parameters [n, (n + 1)/2, d]q and
[n, (n − 1)/2, d ≥ d]q , respectively, where d2 − d + 1 ≥ n.

Let PAut(C) be the permutation automorphism group of a
code C and consider GA1 (I) = {σa,b |a ∈ I ∗ , b ∈ I}, where
gσa,b = ag + b be the afﬁne group. An afﬁne-invariant code
is an extended cyclic code C e over Fq such that GA1 (I) ⊂
PAut(C e ).
Quantum afﬁne-invariant codes were investigated in the
literature [9]. Let us recall a useful result contained in that
paper:
Lemma 3.13: [9, Lemma 22] Let C e be an extended maximal afﬁne-invariant code [pm , pm − 1 − m/r, d]pr , then if
⊥
p > 3 or m > 2 or r = 1, we have (C e ) ⊂ C e .
If one looks more closely one can rewrite Theorem 23
shown in [9] as follows:
Theorem 3.14: [9, Theorem 23] Let q = pr with p a prime
number, m a positive integer and n = pm − 1. If p > 3 or
m > 2 or r = 1 then there exists a AQECC with parameters
[[pm , pm − 2 − 2 m , dz /dx ]]q , where dz ≥ da , dx ≥ da , and
r
da is the minimum distance of an extended maximal afﬁneinvariant code.
We can generate more AQECC derived from afﬁne-invariant
codes provided the existence of self-dual basis.
Theorem 3.15: Let q = pr , where p is an odd prime number
and r > 1 is an odd integer. Assume also that m is a
positive integer and n = pm − 1. If p > 3 or m > 2
or r = 1 then there exists an AQECC com parameters
[[rpm , r(pm − 2 − 2 m ), dz /dx ]]p , where dz ≥ da , dx ≥ da ,
r
and da is the minimum distance of an extended maximal
afﬁne-invariant code.
Proof:
Consider
the
self-orthogonal
extended
maximal afﬁne-invariant code C e with parameters
[pm , pm − 1 − m/r, d] given in Lemma 3.13, where p > 3
(or m > 2 or r = 1) is an odd prime number and r > 1 is an
odd integer.
From hypothesis there exists a self-dual basis β of
⊥
Fq over Fp . Expanding C e and (C e ) with respect to
⊥
e
β = β and since C is self-orthogonal, we obtain codes
⊥
⊥
β(C e ) and [β(C e )] such that [β(C e )] ⊂ β(C e ), that
e
is, β(C ) is also self-orthogonal. Applying the CSS con⊥
struction to the codes β(C e ) and [β(C e )] one obtains an
m
m
m
[[rp , r(p − 2 − 2 r ), dz /dx ]]p AQECC, where dz ≥ da ,
dx ≥ da , and da is the minimum distance of C e .

IV. S UMMARY
We have constructed new families of AQECC derived from
classical generalized Reed-Muller code, quadratic residue,
BCH codes, character and afﬁne-invariant codes by applying
the CSS construction. Concerning future works, it will be
interesting to investigate constructions of AQECC derived
from classical algebraic-geometry codes.
