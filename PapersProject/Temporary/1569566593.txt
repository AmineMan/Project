Abstract—A simple encoding scheme based on Sato’s non-na¨ve
ı
frequency division is proposed for a class of Gaussian interference
channels with mixed interference. The achievable region is shown
to be equivalent to that of Costa’s noiseberg region for the onesided Gaussian interference channel. This allows for an indirect
proof that this simple achievable rate region is indeed equivalent
to the Han-Kobayashi (HK) region with Gaussian input and with
time sharing for this class of Gaussian interference channels with
mixed interference.

The interference channel (IC) describes a network where
multiple transmitters communicate with their intended receivers via a common medium. The characterization of the
capacity region for a two-user IC is an open problem except
for the strong and very strong interference cases [1]–[3].
To date, the largest achievable rate region is the celebrated
Han-Kobayashi (HK) region that employs rate splitting at the
transmitters and simultaneous decoding at the receivers [3].
Not surprisingly, for those ICs whose capacity regions are
completely characterized, it is without an exception that the
capacity region coincides with the HK region.
However, the general HK region involves a time sharing
variable that makes its evaluation intractable. For the Gaussian
interference channel (GIC), another difﬁculty is the input
distribution. A two-user GIC in its standard form can be
represented as
= X1 + bX2 + Z1 ,
= aX1 + X2 + Z2 ,

dimensions [6]. It turns out, as shown in the next section,
that this simple noiseberg scheme achieves precisely the same
HK region with Gaussian input.
This paper focuses on GICs with mixed interference
(MGIC) and with ab ≥ 1, a ≤ 1 and b ≥ 1 (cf. Fig. 1 and
Eq. (1)). We describe a simple coding scheme that combines
the noiseberg scheme with that of simultaneous decoding at
the receiver experiencing strong interference. The obtained rate
region is subsequently shown to coincide with the HK region
with Gaussian input.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we review the noiseberg scheme for the ZGIC and provide
a proof of its equivalence to the HK region with Gaussian
input. Section III describes the coding scheme for a class of
MGIC and proves that the scheme achieves the HK region
with Gaussian input. Section IV concludes this paper.

II. N OISEBERG R EGION FOR THE ZGIC

where X1 and X2 are the input signals and are subject to
respective power constraints P1 and P2 ; Y1 and Y2 are the
received signals; Z1 and Z2 are Gaussian noises of unit
variance and are independent of the inputs X1 and X2 . This
model is depicted in Fig. 1. While for all the cases where
the capacity results are known for a GIC, the optimal input
distribution is invariably Gaussian, it is not yet known (or
proven) that such is the case for the general GIC.
There has been recent progress in obtaining computable
subregion of the HK achievable region using Sato’s non-na¨ve
ı
frequency division [4]. For the one-sided GIC (denoted as
ZGIC) shown in Fig. 2(a), Motahari and Khandani established
that such a non-na¨ve frequency division scheme achieves the
ı
HK region with Gaussian input [5]. Most recently, Costa introduced the so-called noiseberg scheme which uses water ﬁlling
to achieve optimal power sharing between two orthogonal

We consider the degraded GIC shown in Fig. 2(b), which
is equivalent to the ZGIC with a < 1 in Fig. 2(a) [7].
The noiseberg region, denoted by RN and introduced by
Costa in [6] for a ZGIC with weak interference (a < 1 in
Fig. 2(a)) is the set of all nonnegative rate pairs (R1 , R2 )

Costa [6] showed that RN is achievable for the ZGIC
with weak interference by a coding scheme that uses a twoband non-na¨ve frequency division multiplexing (FDM) with
ı
water ﬁlling for optimal power allocation between the two
subbands. The coding scheme, as well as its achievable region,
involves two parameters 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1 and h ≥ 0. They vary
over the admissible region as shown in Fig. 3, resulting in
different transmission schemes depending on the values of the
parameters. The parameter λ determines how to allocate the
frequency band.
• The λ subband is reserved for the communication between transmitter 1 and receiver 1.
¯
• The λ subband is shared by both transceiver pairs and the
corresponding coding scheme is determined by the other
parameter h.
As the noise Z2 does not affect the transmission of X1 ,
water ﬁlling allows the overall power level in the λ-subband
¯
to be raised above that of the λ-subband, with part of the
noise spectrum of Z2 ﬂoating above the signal level. This phenomenon, i.e., the existence of difference in heights of power
spectrum for the two subbands is referred to as the noiseberg.
The parameter h is deﬁned as the height of total power density
in the λ-subband above that of X2 ’s power density in the
¯
λ-subband. Different h values divide the admissible region
for the parameter pairs into two regions, each employing a
¯
different coding scheme in the λ-subband:
2
Multiplex region This corresponds to h ≤ 1−a . As shown
a2
in Fig. 4, Z2 prevents user 1’s power from spilling over to the
¯
λ-band thus no rate-splitting is involved. Receiver 2 decodes
W1 ﬁrst, subtracts it and decodes W2 .

Overﬂow region This corresponds to h > 1−a . As shown
a2
in Fig. 5, water-ﬁlling of user 1’s power occurs as the power
¯
spills over from the λ-subband to the λ-subband. The encoding
¯
scheme in the λ subband thus involves rate splitting for W1 :
a common message W1c with power P1c decoded by both
receivers and a private message W1p with power P1A decoded
only by receiver 1. Receiver 2 decodes W1c ﬁrst, subtracts it,
and decodes W2 , all the while treating W1p as noise.
It is remarkable that such a simple transmission scheme
turns out to achieve precisely the same HK region with time
sharing and with Gaussian input.

the non-na¨ve FDM region, denoted by RF DM , is equivalent
ı
to RHK , whose boundary points can be characterized by the
optimization problem [5, Eq. (151)]. It sufﬁces to verify the
equivalence between RN and RF DM .
We start by considering water ﬁlling in the two-band FDM
applied to the degraded GIC shown in Fig. 2(b). First, we split
W1 into private message W1p with power constraint P1p and
common message W1c with power constraint P1c such that
¯
P1p + P1c = P1 . Power allocation into λ and λ subbands is
done in the following order. First, P1p is allocated to the two
subbands in an arbitrary way. On top of that, P2 is allocated to
the two subbands via waterﬁlling. As Y2 sees additional noise
Z2 , P2 is allocated on top of Z2 (see, e.g., Fig. 6(d)). Finally,
P1c is allocated to the two subbands, again, using waterﬁlling.
Depending on P1p and its allocation between the two
subbands, there are four possible power allocation outcomes
of this scheme, as shown in Fig. 6. Since the scenarios
illustrated in Fig. 6(a)(b)(c) are equivalent to noiseberg cases,
it remains to argue that the power allocation scheme with ﬂat
spectrum top as in Fig. 6(d) is not optimal. This is because the
achievable rates under such a scheme are formed by convex
combinations of points on the curve of associated broadcast
¯
channel capacity, as the ﬂat top requires P1cλ = P1cλ . As
¯
λ
λ
the broadcast channel capacity curve is convex, we can only
achieve the points on the chord, which are dominated by the
points on the curve corresponding to the scheme with no
frequency division. Thus they are not optimal.
Next we generalize this conclusion to three-band FDM.
Similarly we argue that the power-bandwidth allocation
schemes with two or more subbands sharing the same ﬂat
top are not optimal. If two subbands are occupied solely by
the transmission of X1 , they can be merged into one and this
reduces to one of the noiseberg scenarios.

λ-subband, only transmitter 1 transmits and receiver 1 decodes
W1 with a rate constraint deﬁned in (4).
¯
In the λ-subband, transmitter 2 does not use rate splitting.
Transmitter 1, on the other hand, employs two encoding
schemes depending on the value of h. The corresponding
decoding schemes are also different. We describe them in
details below.

Subsequently, X2 is subtracted from Y1 and W1 is decoded
with constraint (2). Receiver 2 decodes W2 with constraint (3).
Comparing (3) and (5), we see that (5) is redundant. Therefore
sequential decoding in the multiplex region achieves RN .

common message W1c and W2 . Then R1λ = S1 + T1 and

refer to RHK as the above HK region with Gaussian input.
The difﬁculty in using this region is largely due to the presence

also utilizes the two-band non-na¨ve FDM. Speciﬁcally, in the

the equivalence between RN and RHK for the MGICs with
ab > 1.
This is consistent with [5, Theorem 12] that states for
the MGICs with ab > 1, RHK is equivalent to that of the
corresponding ZGIC.

IV. C ONCLUSION

(20)

This paper established the equivalence between Costa’s
noiseberg region and the HK region with Gaussian input
for the ZGIC. For the MGICs with ab > 1, an achievable
rate region was developed by rate splitting and a mixture of
sequential and simultaneous decoding. By comparing the new
region to the noiseberg region of the ZGIC, we proved that
it is a simpliﬁcation of the HK region for the MGICs with
ab > 1 and with Gaussian codebook.

Then the achievable rate region in overﬂow region is

regions, we conclude that RN is achievable for the MGICs
with ab > 1. Thus we have,
Theorem 2: For the MGICs with ab > 1, RN associated
with the ZGIC obtained by removing the interfering link with
gain b is achievable.
Corollary 1: For the MGICs with ab > 1, RN = RHK .
Proof: On the one hand, with Gaussian input, RHK of
the MGIC is a subset of that of the ZGIC. On the other
hand, RN ⊆ RHK for the MGIC in general. But Theorem
1 states that RN = RHK for the ZGIC. This establishes

A PPENDIX
In the appendix we prove the equivalence between the
achievable rate region in the overﬂow region and RN .
Comparing this region with RN , we see that (16)(17) and
(2)(3) are identical. Then it remains to show that (15)(18)-(20)
are redundant given (16)(17).

Eq. (18) is redundant, since it is superseded by (16) and
