amount of the random number. So far, there was no paper
investigating how much random number is needed to achieve
the capacity region. Since the random number is precious
resource in practice, though it has been paid no attention in
literatures, it is extremely important to investigate the amount
of random number needed to achieve the capacity region.
For this purpose, we formulate the problem of the BCC by
randomness constrained stochastic encoder, and completely
characterize the capacity region of this new problem.
The present problem to consider the randomness constrained
stochastic encoder is motivated by the authors’ previous results
in [5]. In that paper, the capacity region of the relay channel
with conﬁdential messages for the completely deterministic
encoder was investigated, and the capacity region was characterized for the BCC as a corollary. In this paper, we are
interested in the case such that the randomness is constrained
but not zero. The result in [5] can be regarded as an extreme
case of the present problem. On the other hand, the conventional BCC problem can be regarded as the other extreme case,
in which the amount of randomness that can be used at the
encoder is unbounded.
Typically in the BCC, Alice sends the common message
that is supposed to be decoded by both Bob and Eve, and
the conﬁdential message that is supposed to be decoded only
by Bob. The level of secrecy of the conﬁdential message
is usually evaluated by the equivocation rate. In this paper,
we consider slightly different problem formulation, which has
been appeared in the literature [6], [5]. In our problem setting,
Alice sends three kinds of messages, the common message, the
private message, and the conﬁdential messages. The common
message is supposed to be decoded by both Bob and Eve. The
private message is supposed to be decoded by Bob, and we do
not care whether Eve can decode the private message or not.
The conﬁdential message is supposed to be decoded by Bob,
and it must be kept completely secret from Eve. Furthermore,
for stochastic encoding, Alice is allowed to use limited amount
of dummy randomness. Thus, we are interested in the trade-off
between quadruple of rates, the rate of dummy randomness,
the rates of common, private, and conﬁdential messages. The
coding system of our formulation is depicted in Fig. 1.
The reason we do not use the equivocation rate formulation
is as follows. In the conventional equivocation rate formulation, if the rate of dummy randomness is not sufﬁcient, a part
of the conﬁdential message is sacriﬁced to make the other part
completely secret and the rate of the completely secret part
corresponds to the equivocation rate. We think that the rates

Abstract—In coding schemes for the wire-tap channel or the
broadcast channels with conﬁdential messages, it is well known
that the sender needs to use a stochastic encoding to avoid the
information about the transmitted conﬁdential message to be
leaked to an eavesdropper. In this paper, it is investigated that
the trade-off between the rate of the random number to realize
the stochastic encoding and the rates of the common, private, and
conﬁdential messages. For the direct theorem, the superposition
coding scheme for the wire-tap channel recently proposed by Chia
and El Gamal is employed, and its strong security is proved. The
matching converse theorem is also established. Our result clariﬁes
that a combination of the ordinary stochastic encoding and the
channel preﬁxing by the channel simulation is suboptimal.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The wire-tap channel is one sender and two receivers
broadcast channel model in which the sender, usually referred
to as Alice, wants to transmit a conﬁdential message to the
legitimate receiver, usually referred to as Bob, in such a way
that the other receiver, usually referred to as eavesdropper Eve,
cannot get any information about the transmitted message. The
wire-tap channel model was ﬁrst introduced by Wyner in his
seminal paper [1]. Later, Csisz´ r and K¨ rner investigated the
a
o
model called broadcast channels with conﬁdential messages
(BCC) in which Alice also sends a common message that
is supposed to be decoded by both Bob and Eve. These
models were further investigated by many researchers from
theoretical point of view (e.g.. see [2]), and recently it has
attracted considerable attention from practical point of view
as a physical layer security.
In coding schemes for the wire-tap channel or the BCC, it is
well known that the sender needs to use a stochastic encoder
to avoid the information about the transmitted conﬁdential
message to be leaked to Eve. The stochastic encoding is
usually realized by preparing a dummy random number in
addition to the intended messages and by encoding them
to a transmitted signal by a deterministic encoder. Furthermore, when the channel to Bob is not more capable than
the channel to Eve, it is known that the sender needs to
use the channel preﬁxing to achieve the capacity region (or
the secrecy capacity) because the capacity formulas involve
such a channel from an auxiliary random variable to the
random variable describing the input signal of the channel
[3]. In literatures, it is assumed that there exists a channel
realizing the channel preﬁxing. But in practice the preﬁxing
channel must be simulated from a random number by using
a method such as the channel simulation [4], which usually
involves certain amount of simulation error depending on the

use unlimited amount of dummy randomness in addition to
the messages in their problem formulation. Thus, our results
cannot be derived from their results. In [20], Bloch and
Kliewer considered the wire-tap channel in which the dummy
randomness is constrained and not necessarily uniform. However, they only considered the case such that the channel to
Bob is more capable than that to Eve. In such a case, the
channel preﬁxing is not needed, and their result corresponds
to Corollary 11 in this paper when the dummy randomness is
uniform.
Because of the lack of space, proofs of main results are
omitted in this paper, which can be found in [21].

Fig. 1. The coding system investigated in this paper. Alice sends common
message Kn , private message Ln , and conﬁdential message Sn by using a
deterministic function fn and a limited amount of dummy randomness An .
The common message is supposed to be decoded by both Bob and Eve.
The private message is supposed to be decoded by Bob, and we do not care
whether Eve can decode the private message or not. The conﬁdential message
is supposed to be decoded by Bob, and it must be kept completely secret from
Eve.

II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION AND M AIN R ESULTS
A. Problem Formulation
Let PY |X and PZ|X be two channels with common input alphabet X and output alphabets Y and Z respectively. Throughout the paper, the alphabets are assumed to be ﬁnite though we
do not use ﬁniteness of the alphabet except cardinality bonds
on auxiliary random variables. We also assume that the base
of logarithm is e throughout the paper.
Let Kn be the set of the common message, Ln be the set
of the private message, and Sn be the set of the conﬁdential
message. The common message is supposed to be decoded
by both Bob and Eve. The private message is supposed to
be decoded by Bob, and we do not care whether Eve can
decode the private message or not. The conﬁdential message
is supposed to be decoded by Bob, and it must be kept
completely secret from Eve.
Typically, Alice use a stochastic encoder to make the conﬁdential message secret from Eve, and it is practically realized
by using a uniform dummy randomness on the alphabet An .
When the size |An | of dummy randomness is inﬁnite, any
stochastic encoder from Kn ×Ln ×Sn to X n can be simulated
by a deterministic encoder fn : Kn × Ln × Sn × An → X n .
But we are interested in the case with bounded size |An | in
this paper.
Bob’s decoder is deﬁned by function gn : Y n → Kn ×Ln ×
Sn and the error probability is deﬁned as

of sacriﬁced part and completely secret part become clearer
by employing our formulation.
As we have mentioned above, the typical coding scheme
for the wire-tap channel or the BCC consists of the stochastic
encoding and the channel preﬁxing. In [7], Chia and El
Gamal proposed an alternative coding scheme that utilizes
the so-called superposition coding [8] instead of the channel
preﬁxing. In the direct part of our main result, we employ
this superposition scheme instead of the channel preﬁxing.
We also clariﬁes that a straightforward combination of the
ordinary stochastic coding and the channel preﬁxing by the
channel simulation method is suboptimal.
Although Chia and El Gamal showed that the superposition
coding scheme can realize the so-called weak security criterion
[9], [10], it was not clear whether the superposition coding
scheme can realize the so-called strong security criterion. One
of technical contributions of this paper is to show that Chin
and El Gamal’s superposition coding scheme can realize the
strong security criterion. This is done by using the technique
proposed in [11], and by considering the channel resolvability
problem [12] with the superposition coding. Note that the
relationship between the wire-tap channel coding and the
channel resolvability was ﬁrst pointed out by Csisz´ r [10],
a
and is well recognized recently [13], [14], [15], [16]. The
channel resolvability with the superposition coding was ﬁrst
investigated by the second author in [17]. In that paper, the
channel resolvability problem with the superposition coding
for the degraded broadcast channel was considered to show the
converse theorem of the identiﬁcation via degraded broadcast
channels. In this paper, the channel resolvability problem with
the superposition coding for a single channel is considered.
Using the superposition coding for a single channel seems
nonsense at ﬁrst glance, it does have a meaning when applied
to the wire-tap channel or the BCC.
After the submission of the ﬁrst manuscript of this paper,
we noticed some related works investigating the importance
of random number in the BCC or the wire-tap channel. In
[18], Hayashi and Matsumoto considered the secure multiplex
coding [19] in which the messages are not necessarily uniform
nor independent and the entropy rate of the messages might
be constrained. Although the secure multiplex coding can be
regarded as a generalization of the BCC, the encoder can

the conventional BCC (see Corollary 5). The conditions on R1
and Rd in Eqs. (12) and (13) additionally appear in Theorem
2 because there are randomness constraints in our problem
setting.

main theorem, the private message can be used as dummy
randomness to protect the conﬁdential message from Eve.

In this paper, we are interested in the trade-off among the
rate the dummy randomness, and the rates of the common,
private, and conﬁdential messages.
Deﬁnition 1: The rate quadruple (Rd , R0 , R1 , Rs ) is said to
be achievable if there exists a sequence of Alice’s deterministic
encoder fn : Kn × Ln × Sn × An → X n , Bob’s decoder
gn : Y n → Kn × Ln × Sn , and Eve’s decoder ϕn : Z n → Kn

region R is broader than region R. Indeed, R is a closed
convex set consisting of those quadruples (Rd , R0 , R1 , Rs ) for
which there exist auxiliary random variables (U, V ) satisfying
the same conditions as Theorem 2 except Eq. (12)1 .
Remark 4: Eq. (13) means that there is a certain amount of
dummy randomness that cannot be substituted by the private
message. Note that the difference between the private message
and the dummy randomness is whether Bob needs to decode
it or not.

B. Statements of General Results
The following is our main result in this paper.
Theorem 2: Let R∗ be a closed convex set consisting
of those quadruples (Rd , R0 , R1 , Rs ) for which there exist
auxiliary random variables (U, V ) such that U ↔ V ↔ X ↔
(Y, Z) and

Let
Rdet = {(R0 , R1 , Rs ) : (0, R0 , R1 , Rs ) ∈ R}
be the set of all rate triplets that can be achieved by deterministic encoder. This extreme case was solved in [5], which can
be also derived as a corollary of Theorem 23 .
Corollary 6: ([5]) Let R∗ be a closed convex set condet
sisting of those triplet (R0 , R1 , Rs ) for which there exists an
auxiliary random variable U such that U ↔ X ↔ (Y, Z) and

≤ min[I(U ; Y ), I(U ; Z)],

≥ I(X; Z|U ),
(12)
≥ I(X; Z|V ).

Then we have R = R∗ . Moreover, it may be assumed that
V = (U, V ′ ) and that the ranges of U and V ′ may be assumed
to satisfy |U| ≤ |X | + 3 and |V ′ | ≤ |X | + 1.
The conditions on R0 and R1 + Rs in Eqs. (9) and (10) resemble the conditions in the broadcast channel with degraded
message sets [22]. The condition on Rs in Eq. (11) exists
because there is a security requirement on the conﬁdential
message. These conditions are exactly the same as those in

I(X; Z|U ).

1 It can be proved by just omitting the derivation of Eq. (12) in the converse
proof of Theorem 2.
2 See also [6, Theorem 17.13] for the result that does not employ the rateequivocation formulation.
3 In [5], slightly deferent problem formulation is employed and the achievable region seems slightly different from Corollary 6. But they are essentially
the same.

Let

random variables (U, V ) such that U ↔ V ↔ X ↔ (Y, Z)
and

Rs
Rd

be the inﬁmum rate of dummy randomness needed to achieve
the rates (R0 , Rs ). From Theorem 2, we can characterize not
only the known extreme cases (Corollary 5 and Corollary 6)
but also this quantity.
Corollary 7: Rd (R0 , Rs ) is the optimal solution of the
following optimization problem:

Rs
Rd

where (U, V ) satisfy U ↔ V ↔ X ↔ (Y, Z).
Let
Rds = {(Rd , Rs ) : (Rd , 0, 0, Rs ) ∈ R}.

C. Numerical Examples

(15)
(16)

First, we consider an example such that R∗ and R∗
sim
ds
coincide. Suppose that PY |X and PZ|X are binary symmetric
channels with crossover probabilities ε1 and ε2 respectively,
where ε1 < ε2 . In this case, PZ|X is degraded version of
PY |X , which also implies that PY |X is more capable than
PZ|X . Thus, we can apply Corollary 11. Since the auxiliary
random variable U only plays a role of time sharing, region
Rds is the convex hull of the rates (Rd , Rs ) satisfying

Then we have Rds = R∗ .
ds
Remark 9: The auxiliary random variable U in Corollary 8
only plays a role of time-sharing. Thus, the range of U may be
assumed to satisfy |U| ≤ 2. The same remark is also applied
for Corollary 11.
Let

Rs
Rd

Cs = sup{Rs : (Rd , Rs ) ∈ Rds }
be the secrecy capacity, which can be characterized by the
supremum of the rate Rs for which there exists auxiliary
random variable V such that V ↔ X ↔ (Y, Z) and
Rs ≤ I(V ; Y ) − I(V ; Z).

≤ I(X; Y |U ) − I(X; Z|U ),
≥ I(X; Z|U ).

Moreover, it may be assumed that the ranges of U may be
assumed to satisfy |U| ≤ 2.
As we can ﬁnd from Corollary 11, we do not need auxiliary
random variable V when the channel PY |X is more capable
than PZ|X . Thus, two regions R∗ and R∗ coincide.
sim
ds

As a corollary of Theorem 2, we also have the following.
Corollary 8: Let R∗ be a closed convex set consisting of
ds
those rate pair (Rd , Rs ) for which there exist auxiliary random
variables (U, V ) such that U ↔ V ↔ X ↔ (Y, Z) and
≤ I(V ; Y |U ) − I(V ; Z|U ),
≥ I(X; Z|U ).

(18)
(19)

Then we have R∗ ⊂ Rds .
sim
Since I(X; Z|U ) = I(V ; Z|U ) + I(X; Z|V ) < I(V ; Z|U ) +
H(X|V ) in general, the region R∗ is strictly broader than
ds
the region R∗ , i.e., the straightforward combination of the
sim
ordinary wire-tap channel coding and the channel preﬁxing by
the channel simulation is suboptimal.
Corollary 11: Suppose that the channel PY |X is more capable than PZ|X . Then the region Rds = R∗ is a closed convex
ds
set consisting of those rate pair (Rd , Rs ) for which there exists
an auxiliary random variable U such that U ↔ X ↔ (Y, Z)
and

minimize
I(X; Z|U )
subject to
R0 ≤ min[I(U ; Y ), I(U ; Z)],
R0 + Rs ≤ I(X; Y |U ) + min[I(U ; Y ), I(U ; Z)],
Rs ≤ I(X; Y |U ) − I(X; Z|U ),

Rs
Rd

≤ I(V ; Y |U ) − I(V ; Z|U ),
≥ I(V ; Z|U ) + H(X|V ).

≤ [h(p ∗ ε1 ) − h(ε1 )] − [h(p ∗ ε2 ) − h(ε2 )],
≥ h(p ∗ ε2 ) − h(ε2 )

for some input distribution 0 ≤ PX (0) = p ≤ 1, where h(·) is
the binary entropy function 5 and x ∗ y = x(1 − y) + (1 − x)y
is the binary convolution. In Fig. 2, for the case with ε1 = 0.1
and ε2 = 0.2 respectively, the region Rds is plotted. The input
distribution achieving Cs is the uniform distribution, and thus
Rs is constant when Rd ≥ log 2 − h(0.2). By using a biased
input distribution, Rs can be positive even if Rd is smaller
than log 2 − h(0.2).
Next, we consider an example such that R∗ and R∗ do
sim
ds
not coincide. Suppose that PY |X is a binary symmetric channel
with crossover probability ε and PZ|X is a binary erasure
channel with erasure probability δ. When 4ε(1 − ε) log 2 <
δ log 2 ≤ h(ε), it is known that PY |X is not more capable
than PZ|X [23]. For this example, we can compute the regions
Rds = R∗ as follows. Since R∗ is a convex set, for each Rd ,
ds
ds
we can calculate max{Rs : (Rd , Rs ) ∈ R∗ } by minimizing
ds

(17)

To achieve the rate given by the right hand side of Eq. (17),
we conventionally used the following coding scheme. First,
we construct a wire-tap channel code for channel pairs PY |V
and PZ|V . Then, the code word in V n is transmitted over
n
n
preﬁxing channel PX|V . If we simulate channel PX|V by using
the channel simulation method [4], then we need randomness
with rate H(X|V )4 . By using this argument, we can derive
the following inner bound on Rds that can be achieved
by combining the ordinary wire-tap channel coding and the
channel preﬁxing by the channel simulation method.
Proposition 10: Let R∗ be a closed convex set consisting
sim
of those rate pair (Rd , Rs ) for which there exist auxiliary

max [I(V ; Y |U ) − I(V ; Z|U ) − µ(I(X; Z|U ) − Rd )] (20)

4 We

are implicitly assuming that the empirical distributions of almost every
code words are close to PV , which is true if we use the random coding
method.

Eq. (20), we can take U to be constant. Furthermore, by using
the support lemma [6], we can assume that |V| ≤ |X | = 2.
Thus, Eq. (20) can be calculated by exhaustive search of three
parameters PV (0), PX|V (0|0), and PX|V (1|1). Since PV (0) =
