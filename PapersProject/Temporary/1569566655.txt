code. As mentioned in [4], their results on the outage probability cannot be directly applied to this metric due to the
maximization. In this paper, we prove that to achieve the
maximum throughput in an uncorrelated MISO channel, the
optimum transmit strategy is to send equal power uncorrelated
signals from all available antennas.
The maximum average achievable rate is another performance measure which is important in some applications. A
good example for such applications is a TV broadcasting
system where users with better channels can receive additional
services such as high deﬁnition TV signals [5]. Due to the
large number of users, the transmitter cannot access the CSI.
In order to increase the average achievable rate, Shamai and
Steiner [6] proposed a broadcast approach (multi-layer coding)
for a point-to-point block fading channel with no CSI at the
transmitter. Since the average achievable rate increases with
the number of code layers, they reached the highest average
achievable rate using a continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) code.
This idea was applied to a two-hop single-relay channel in [7],
a two-hop parallel-relay network (the diamond channel) in [8],
and a channel with two collocated cooperative users in [9]. The
optimized trade-off between the QoS and network coverage in
a multicast network was derived in [5] using the broadcast
approach. Here, we derive the maximum expected-rate of
MISO channels, which is deﬁned as the maximum average
decodable rate when a multi-layer code is transmitted. We
prove that to maximize the expected-rate in MISO channels,
it is optimum to transmit equal power independent signals on
all available antennas in each layer. Using the continuouslayer coding approach, the maximum expected-rate of MISO
channels is then obtained and formulated in closed form.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
the preliminaries are presented. Then, the maximum throughput and the maximum expected-rate of MISO channels are
obtained in Sections III and IV, respectively.

Abstract—The point-to-point multiple-input single-output
(MISO) channel is investigated in uncorrelated block fading
environment with Rayleigh distribution. The maximum throughput and maximum expected-rate of this channel are obtained
under the assumption that the transmitter is oblivious to the
channel state information (CSI), however, the receiver has perfect
CSI. First, we prove that the optimum transmission strategy
maximizing the throughput is to use all available antennas
and perform equal power allocation with uncorrelated signals.
Furthermore, to increase the expected-rate, multi-layer coding
is applied. Analogously, we establish that sending uncorrelated
signals and performing equal power allocation across all available
antennas at each layer is optimum. Finally, a closed form
expression for the maximum continuous-layer expected-rate of
MISO channels is also obtained.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The growing demand for QoS and network coverage inspires the use of multiple-antenna arrays at the transmitter
and/or receiver. It has been shown that multiple-antenna arrays
have the ability to reach higher transmission rates [1], [2].
With no delay constraint, the ergodic nature of the fading
channel can be experienced by sending very large transmission
blocks, and the ergodic capacity is well studied [3]. When
the channel variation is slow, the channel can be estimated
relatively accurately at the receiver. By assuming perfect CSI
at the receiver but no CSI at the transmitter, Telatar [2] showed
that the ergodic capacity of multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) channels is achieved by sending an uncorrelated circularly symmetric zero mean equal power complex Gaussian
codebook on all transmit antennas.
Due to the stringent delay constraint for the problem in
consideration, the transmission block length is forced to be
shorter than the dynamics of the slow fading process, though
still large enough to yield a reliable communication. The
performance of such channels are usually evaluated by outage
capacity. Jorswieck and Boch [4] proved that in uncorrelated
MISO channels, the optimum transmit strategy minimizing the
outage probability is to use a fraction of all available transmit
antennas and perform equal power allocation with uncorrelated
signals.
The maximum throughput is an important performance
measure in block fading channels, which is deﬁned as the
maximum of the product of the transmission rate and the
probability of successful transmission using a single-layer

A MISO channel with nt transmit antennas is deﬁned as a
channel with the input-output relationship Y = hX +Z, where
Y is the received signal, hT ∼ [CN (0, 1)]nt ×1 is the channel
vector, Z ∼ CN (0, 1) is the independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and

Deﬁnition 1 The throughput Rs is the average achievable
rate when a single-layer code with a ﬁxed rate R is transmitted, i.e., the transmission rate times the probability of successful transmission. The maximum throughput, namely Rm ,

Let the transmitted signal X be a single-layer code with
rate R = ln (1 + P s). In the MISO channel, the maximum
throughput in Eq. (1) can be rewritten as

For transmission rate R, the throughput is Rs = P out (R)R,
where Pout (R) is the outage probability of a ﬁxed transmission
rate R. It is proved in [4] that the optimum transmit strategy
minimizing the outage probability is to send uncorrelated circularly symmetric zero mean equal power complex Gaussian
signals from a fraction of antennas. Thus, here, one can restrict
the transmit covariance matrix Q to diagonal matrices whose
diagonal entries are either zero or a constant subject to the
total power constraint P .
In following, Theorem 1 proves that the optimum solution
with respect to R, denoted by Ro , maximizing P out (R)R is
less than ln (1 + P ). In this range of the transmission rate,
the optimum transmit strategy which minimizes the outage
probability and consequently, maximizes the throughput is to
use all available antennas. Equation (6) yields the maximum
throughput of an nt × 1 MISO block Rayleigh fading channel.

Deﬁnition 2 The expected-rate Rf is the statistical expectation of the achievable rate when a multi-layer code is
transmitted. The maximum expected-rate, namely Rm , is the
f
maximum of the expected-rate over all transmit covariance
matrices and transmission rates in each layer, and all power
distributions of the layers. Mathematically,
Rm =

where E1 (·) is the exponential integral function. The ergodic
capacity in a 1 × nr single-input multiple-output (SIMO)
channel with total power constraint P equals the ergodic
capacity of an nr ×1 MISO channel with total power constraint
nr P .

the instantaneous mutual information is I = ln 1 + hQh† .

used throughout the paper are deﬁned.

If a continuum of code layers are transmitted, the maximum
continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) expected-rate, namely Rm , is
c
given by maximizing the continuous-layer expected-rate over
the layers’ power distribution.

Remark 2 Note that g (s, P ) is a strictly increasing function

Since Rs (s) is a continuous function, according to Eq. (18),
for all positive integer values of lt and positive values of P ,
one can conclude that Rs (s) takes its maximum at 0 < so < 1.
Jorswieck and Boche [4] proved that when P > eR − 1,
or equivalently s < 1, the optimum transmission strategy to
minimize the outage probability is to use all available antennas
with equal power allocation. Since ∀lt , 0 < so < 1, the
optimum strategy maximizing the throughput is to use all
available antennas and perform equal power allocation. The
maximum throughput is given by Eq. (6).

Let us deﬁne the following functions,

Remark 3 In a correlated MISO channel wherein the transmitter does neither know the CSI nor the channel correlation,
the outage probability is a Schur-convex (resp. Schur-concave)
function of the channel covariance matrix for P > eR − 1
R
−1
(resp. P < e 2 ) [4]. According to Theorem 1, in the
o
maximum throughput of the MISO channel, we have eR −1 <
P . Hence, in this range of the transmission rate, Rs is a
Schur-concave function of the channel covariance matrix, i.e.,
channel correlation decreases the throughput. In terms of the
impact of correlation in the MISO channel with uninformed
transmitter, the behavior of the maximum throughput is similar
to the behavior of the ergodic capacity which is also a Schurconcave function of the channel covariance matrix [11].

A block fading channel can be modeled by an equivalent broadcast channel whose receiver channels represent any
fading coefﬁcient realization. The expected-rate of a fading
channel is equal to a weighted sum-rate of its equivalent
broadcast channel in which the weights distribution is the
complementary CDF (tail distribution) of the channel gain
[6]. In broadcast channels, any maximum weighted sumrate with positive value weights is on the capacity region
[5]. Since superposition (multi-layer) coding achieves the
capacity region of degraded broadcast channels, it is the
optimum coding strategy to maximize the average achievable
rate in any block fading channel whose equivalent broadcast
channel is degraded [6]. An example for such channels is
the SISO channel. Although multi-layer coding is not the
optimum coding strategy in MISO channels, it increases the
average achievable rate of the channel. Numerical results
for the continuous-layer expected-rate of MISO and SIMO
block Rayleigh fading channels were presented in [12]. Here,
the optimum transmit covariance matrix at each code layer
is obtained, and consequently, the maximum expected-rate
of the MISO channel is analytically formulated. Note that
the maximum expected-rate of the SIMO channel with nt
receive antennas can be calculated using the same formula
by replacing P with nt P in Theorem 3.
In order to enhance the lucidity of this section, we divide
it into two subsections. Section IV-A presents the maximum
expected-rate of the MISO channel when a ﬁnite-layer code
is transmitted. The more code layers, the higher expectedrate. Hence, a continuous-layer (inﬁnite-layer) code yields
the highest expected-rate of the channel. The maximum
continuous-layer expected-rate of the MISO channel is derived
in Section IV-B in closed form.

Theorem 3 In the MISO block Rayleigh fading channel, the
maximum continuous-layer expected-rate obtained by optimizing the power distribution over the layers is given by

Remark 7 Similar to remark 3, one can conclude that for 0 <
so < 1, ∀i, the maximum expected-rate of the MISO channel
i
with uninformed transmitter is a Schur-concave function of the
channel covariance matrix, that is channel correlation reduces
the maximum expected-rate.

In the continuous-layer coding, a.k.a. broadcast approach, a
continuum of code layers is transmitted. Similar to ﬁnite-layer
coding in Section IV-A, the receiver decodes the signal from
the lowest layer up to the layer that the channel condition
allows. Theorem 3 yields a closed form expression for the
maximum continuous-layer expected-rate in the MISO channel
by optimizing the power distribution over the layers. Due to
space limitations, the proof is offered in [10].

Remark 6 Since the equivalent broadcast channel of the
MISO channel is not degraded, its maximum continuouslayer expected-rate is not the maximum average achievable
rate of the channel. For example, in asymptotically low SNR
regime, the multiple-access scheme provides a higher average
achievable rate in the MISO channel. In the multiple-access
scheme, the antennas send independent messages, and the
receiver decodes as much as it can.

Therefore, Eqs. (17) and (18) still hold with the above
functions, and lead to 0 < so < 1. This directly corresponds
i
to the proof of Theorem 1 and shows that the optimum power
allocation strategy is to use all available antennas with equal
i
power allocation in each layer, i.e., Qo = Pt Int , and the
i
n
maximum expected-rate is given by Eq. (22).

Remark 5 By substituting nt = 2 in Theorem 3, the maximum
continuous-layer expected-rate of a 2 × 1 MISO channel is

(31)

As pointed out earlier, one can model a point-to-point block
Rayleigh fading channel with an equivalent broadcast channel.
According to the degradedness of the equivalent SISO broadcast channel, and the optimality of superposition (multi-layer)
coding for such channels, the maximum continuous-layer
expected-rate of the SISO channel, i.e., Eq. (31), represents
its maximum average achievable rate [6].
