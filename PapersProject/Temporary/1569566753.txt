Optimal Power Allocation for GSVD-Based
Beamforming in the MIMO Gaussian Wiretap
Channel
S. Ali. A. Fakoorian, Student Member, IEEE and A. Lee Swindlehurst, Fellow, IEEE
capacity in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime was
obtained in [4]. In [5], the rank property of the optimal input
covariance matrix for the secrecy rate maximization problem
is discussed but the authors cannot characterize the solution for
the general case. For some special cases of the MIMO wiretap
channel, where the solution has rank one, the optimal input
covariance matrix that achieves the secrecy capacity under the
average total power constraint was obtained in [5]-[7].
In [8], Liu and Shamai propose a more information-theoretic
approach using the enhancement concept, originally presented
by Weingarten et al. [10], as a tool for the characterization
of the MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel capacity. Liu and
Shamai have shown that an enhanced degraded version of the
channel attains the same secrecy capacity as does a Gaussian
input distribution. From the mathematical solution in [8] it
was evident that such an enhanced channel exists; however
it was not clear how to construct such a channel until the
work of [9], which provided a closed-form expression for the
secrecy capacity under a covariance matrix power constraint.
While this result is interesting since the expression for the
secrecy capacity is valid for all SNR scenarios, there still
exists no computable secrecy capacity expression for the
MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel under an average total power
constraint.
In this paper, we investigate the non-convex optimization
of the secrecy rate for the general Gaussian multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channel under the average
total power constraint, where the number of antennas is
arbitrary for both the transmitter and the two receivers. We
focus on the case where the transmitter uses beamforming
(linear precoding) based on the generalized singular value
decomposition (GSVD). In particular, we obtain the optimal
power allocation that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate
for the GSVD scheme. The resulting power allocation is
signiﬁcantly different in nature than the standard water-ﬁlling
solution for achieving capacity in MIMO links without secrecy
considerations. Compared with [4], our beamforming matrix
is much simpler to compute, and the input covariance matrix
that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate is completely characterized in terms of the beamforming and power allocation
matrices. We note that the analysis in this paper characterizes
the maximum achievable secrecy rate of the Gaussian MIMO
wiretap channel with GSVD-based precoding for any SNR
conditions, while [4] gives the high SNR secrecy capacity of
a Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel.

Abstract—This paper considers a multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) Gaussian wiretap channel model, where there
exists a transmitter, a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper, each equipped with multiple antennas. Perfect secrecy is
achieved when the transmitter and the legitimate receiver can
communicate at some positive rate, while ensuring that the
eavesdropper gets zero bits of information. In this paper, the
perfect secrecy rate of the multiple antenna MIMO wiretap
channel is maximized for arbitrary numbers of antennas under
the assumption that the transmitter performs beamforming based
on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD). More
precisely, the optimal allocation of power for the GSVD-based
precoder that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate is derived.
Numerical results are presented to illustrate that the achievable
secrecy rate of the GSVD-based precoding approach is nearly
identical to that of the optimal scheme.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The broadcast nature of a wireless medium makes it very
susceptible to eavesdropping, where the transmitted message
is decoded by unintended receiver(s). Recent informationtheoretic research on secure communication has focused on
enhancing security at the physical layer. The wiretap channel,
ﬁrst introduced and studied by Wyner [1], is the most basic
physical layer model that captures the problem of communication security. Wyner showed that when an eavesdropper’s
channel is a degraded version of the main channel, the source
and destination can achieve a positive secrecy rate, while
ensuring that the eavesdropper gets zero bits of information.
The maximum secrecy rate from the source to the destination
is deﬁned as the secrecy capacity. The Gaussian wiretap
channel, in which the outputs at the legitimate receiver and
at the eavesdropper are corrupted by additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN), was studied in [2].
Determining the secrecy capacity of a Gaussian wiretap
channel is in general a difﬁcult non-convex optimization problem, and has been addressed independently in [3]-[9]. Oggier
and Hassibi [3] and Khisti and Wornell [4] followed an indirect
approach using a Sato-like argument and matrix analysis tools.
They considered the problem of ﬁnding the secrecy capacity of
the Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel under the average total
power constraint, and a closed-form expression for the secrecy

q=min(nt , ne + nr ), such that

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the
next section, we describe the assumed mathematical model.
We then present the GSVD method and derive the optimal
power allocation that maximizes the achievable secrecy rate
in Section III. Finally, we demonstrate our results by means
of several numerical examples in Section IV.

Hr A = Ψ r C
He A = Ψ e D

Consider a multiple-antenna wiretap channel with nt transmit antennas and nr and ne receive antennas at the legitimate
recipient and the eavesdropper, respectively:

x = AXS ,

ye = He x + ze

[I(X; Yr ) − I(X; Ye )]

(7)

yr = Ψr CXS + zr

(8)

ye = Ψe DXS + ze

(9)

Considering the above equations, the maximization problem
in (4) for the GSVD-based beamforming is represented by

(3)

Rsec = max[I(X; Yr ) − I(X; Ye )] =
Qx

where (.)H denotes the Hermitian (i.e., conjugate) transpose,
E is the expectation operator, and Tr(.) is the matrix trace.
A matrix characterization of the secrecy capacity is given
by [3]
Csec =

XS ∼ CN (0, P)

where A is obtained from gsvd(Hr , He ) as above, and
each element of the vector XS represents an independently
encoded Gaussian codebook symbol that is beamformed with
the corresponding column of the A matrix. P is a positive
semi-deﬁnite diagonal matrix representing the power allocated
by the transmitter to the data symbols. In the following, we
derive an optimal source power allocation which achieves the
maximum secrecy rate of the GSVD-based MIMO Gaussian
wiretap channel. Substituting (7) into the channel model (1)(2) and using (5)-(6) yields

where x is a zero-mean nt × 1 transmitted signal vector,
zr ∈ Cnr ×1 and ze ∈ Cne ×1 are the additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) vectors at the receiver and eavesdropper,
respectively, with i.i.d. entries distributed as CN (0, 1). The
matrices Hr ∈ Cnr ×nt and He ∈ Cne ×nt represent the
channels associated with the receiver and the eavesdropper,
respectively. Similar to other papers considering the perfect
secrecy rate of the wiretap channel, we assume that the
transmitter has perfect channel state information (CSI) for both
the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper.
We assume that the channel input x satisﬁes the average
power constraint Pt , i.e.,
Tr(E{xxH }) ≤ Pt

The nonzero elements of C are in ascending order while the
nonzero elements of D are in descending order. Moreover,
CT C + DT D = I.
Now, let the transmitted signal vector x be constructed as

Theorem 1: Assuming that the transmitter applies the
proposed beamforming matrix A, the optimal power allocation
matrix P∗ that achieves the maximum secrecy rate in problem

Lagrange parameter µ > 0 is chosen to satisfy the power
constraint (3).
Proof: The optimization problem is non-convex. Our proof
technique involves applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions (as necessary conditions), which help express the
Lagrangian in the form of an integral. This speciﬁc structure of
the problem is then exploited to obtain a closed-form solution
for the optimal power allocation strategy. Details can be found
in the Appendix.
Eqs. (5) and (6) show that applying the GSVD transform
to Hr and He simultaneously diagonalizes them. Thus, the

III. O PTIMAL P OWER A LLOCATION FOR THE
GSVD-BASED MIMO G AUSSIAN W IRETAP C HANNEL
We consider the non-convex maximization problem in (4)
for the case that the transmitter performs beamforming by applying the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)
to the channel matrices Hr and He . Application of the GSVD
technique was ﬁrst used by Khisti and Wornell (see e.g. [4])
who obtained a closed-form expression for the secrecy capacity in the high SNR regime. In this section, we ﬁrst describe the
GSVD beamforming method and next we derive the optimal
power allocation matrix that maximizes the achievable secrecy
rate for the GSVD-based beamforming under any SNR regime.
We also describe some important advantages of this scheme
over what is proposed in [4].
Deﬁnition 1 (GSVD Transform): Given two matrices Hr
∈ Cnr ×nt and He ∈ Cne ×nt , gsvd(Hr , He ) returns unitary
matrices Ψr ∈ Cnr ×nr and Ψe ∈ Cne ×ne , non-negative

GSVD transform creates a set of parallel independent subchannels between the sender and the receivers, and it sufﬁces to use
independent Gaussian codebooks across these subchannels.
More precisely, as (11) indicates, it is optimal to use only
those subchannels for which the output at the eavesdropper is
a degraded version of the output at the destination node. These
subchannels correspond to the condition ci > di , or as shown
in [4], generalized singular values of gsvd(Hr , He ) which are
larger than 1. Clearly, if there are no such subchannels, the
achievable secrecy rate using this transmission scheme would
be zero [11].
It is interesting to note that the optimal power allocation
(11) is different from the water-ﬁlling allocation that achieves
capacity for fading channels without the secrecy constraint.
Moreover, as we will observe in Section IV, (11) has an
important role in achieving the secrecy capacity for the high
SNRs regime. We have the following result.

Proof: Follows directly from substituting (11) in to (10) and
by considering the fact that Ψr and Ψe are unitary matrices.
It was shown in [4] that GSVD beamforming with uniform
power allocation is sufﬁcient to attain the secrecy capacity of
a MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel in the high SNR regime.
However, for the case where there is a non-trivial nullspace
in the channel between the transmitter and eavesdropper, the
optimal input covariance matrix that achieves the secrecy
capacity is not fully characterized in [4]. When there is such
a nullspace, [4] uses a complicated beamforming matrix to
transmit two groups of information bearing symbols into two
different subspaces. The associated beamforming matrices are
obtained by performing an LQ decomposition on A as well
as additional calculations which lead to Eq. (114) in [4]. The
aforementioned subspaces are identiﬁed as follows [4, Eq. (2)]:

(13)

where Null(.) denotes the nullspace of its matrix argument,
while ⊥ denotes the orthogonal complement.
As indicated in [4], most of the transmission power is
assumed to be allocated to the subspace S1 and only a
small fraction for S2 , and the available power is distributed
uniformly over the dimensions of each of these two subspaces.
The exact allocation of power between these two subspaces
is not speciﬁed in [4], nor is the sensitivity of the secrecy
capacity to the power allocation studied. In the next section,
we show that the secrecy capacity of a MIMO Gaussian
wiretap channel is in fact quite sensitive to how power is
allocated between these two subspaces, which illustrates that
using the proposed optimal power allocation is essential. We
also compare via simulation the achievable secrecy rate of
the proposed GSVD-based beamforming with the secrecy
capacity, by considering some examples for which the secrecy
capacity is known.

mum achievable secrecy rate for the GSVD-based beamforming, which is obtained by the optimal power allocation, with
the secrecy capacity. This comparison is performed for various
transmit powers, channel conditions and also different numbers
of antennas for the transmitter and receivers. In each trial, the
secrecy rate achieved by the GSVD solution is obtained by
evaluating Eq. (12), while the secrecy capacity for the ﬁrst
example (Fig. 1), which is a MISOME wiretap channel, is
obtained using [6, Eq. (11)], and the secrecy capacity for the
second example (Fig. 2), which considers a general MIMO
wiretap channel, is obtained using an exhaustive search [10,
Lemma 1].
As Fig. 1 and Fig.2 show, the performance of the proposed
GSVD-based beamforming approach is essentially identical
to that of the optimal solution (secrecy capacity), while not
requiring an exhaustive search.
In the following two examples, we consider the case where
the nullspace of the eavesdropper’s channel is non-trivial. Figs.
3 and 4 investigate the allocation of power between subspaces
S1 and S2 as deﬁned in (13), for a case where nt = nr =
5, ne = 4 and the transmit power is Pt = 100, or SNR=20
dB. The solid horizontal line illustrates the achievable secrecy
rate of a Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel with GSVD-based
beamforming and optimal power allocation (Eq. 12), while the
dashed curve represents the secrecy rate achieved by uniform
power allocation versus the fraction of power used in subspace
S2 . The latter secrecy rate is achieved by using analytical
results presented in [4]. Note that, for this high SNR scenario,
the peak of this curve is the secrecy capacity of the MIMO
Gaussian wiretap channel [4]. Note also that, contrary to
claims made in [4], the secrecy rate is quite sensitive to the
fraction of power allocated to the two subspaces, and optimal
performance requires a non-trivial allocation of power to S2

(over 20%). The advantage of the optimal GSVD-based power
allocation approach is that this imprecise distribution of power
to the two subspaces is eliminated.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have considered the problem of linear
beamforming for a MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel. We
proposed an optimal power allocation for GSVD-based beamforming that maximized the achievable secrecy rate. Our numerical results demonstrate that the optimal power allocation
is necessary even for relatively high SNRs.
A PPENDIX
We are interested in obtaining the power distribution that
maximizes the achievable secrecy rate of the Gaussian MIMO
wiretap channel in problem (10) for the GSVD-based beamforming scheme presented in Section III. This non-convex
optimization problem is to be solved with the average power
constraint
H
Tr(E{xxH }) = Tr(AE{XS XS }AH )

= Tr(APAH ) = Tr(AH AP) ≤ Pt

(14)

By considering the fact that Ψr and Ψe are unitary matrices
and det(I + EF) = det(I + FE), the Lagrangian function L
associated with this problem is given by
L = log |I+PCT C|−log |I+PDT D|−µTr(AH AP) (15)
where µ > 0 is the Lagrange multiplier. Since P, CT C and
DT D are diagonal matrices, L can be written as

fi (x) ≤ 0. Hence, the maximum of Li is achieved by

2) ci > di : In this case, since fi (x) is a decreasing function

the largest root of fi (x) = 0, i.e.,
xLi =
