varying were given in [13] and [14] respectively. These works
introduced several new techniques to prove converse and
achievability which were not present in the study of secure
MIMO communication with known eavesdropper channel
states.
In this work, we continue this line of work by studying
the two-user MIMO interference channel with an external
eavesdropper. Previously this channel model was only studied
with the eavesdropper channel state perfectly known to all
nodes and its s.d.o.f. region is still open [15], [16]. Here
we study the channel model where the eavesdropper channel
state is arbitrarily varying and known to the eavesdropper
only. We focus on the case where the ranks of channel
matrices between legitimate nodes do not exceed 2 while
the eavesdropper has 1 antenna. For a nontrivial class of
these channels models, we ﬁnd its s.d.o.f. region which is
achieved by allowing only one user to transmit at a time.
We also provide a non-trivial example for which we show
such a transmission strategy is suboptimal. The achievability
proof for this example introduces a new technique to achieve
secrecy in MIMO wiretap channels. The technique leverages
the fact that the eavesdropper can not obtain arbitrary linear
combinations of the signals transmitted over multiple channel
uses due to it having only one antenna. Hence the transmitter
and receiver can use linear precoding such that effectively
the information-carrying signals are beam-formed toward a
direction which can not be attained by the eavesdropper and
at the same time is orthogonal to the interference from the
other transmitter. The transmitter injects noise to jam the
eavesdropper [17] but precodes its jamming signals so that
they align with the interference at the intended receiver. This
enables the receiver to nullify both interference and jamming
signals and achieve secrecy.

Abstract—In this work we considered the Gaussian twouser interference channel where the eavesdropper channel is
arbitrarily varying, all channel matrices have rank less than or
equal to 2, and the eavesdropper has 1 antenna. We identify
a class of these channel models for which the secrecy degrees
of freedom (s.d.o.f.) region is achieved by letting only one user
transmit a time. We also provided a non-trivial example for
which such a transmission strategy is sub-optimal in terms
of s.d.o.f. region. The achievable scheme for this example
introduces a new technique to achieve secrecy for MIMO
wiretap channels, in which the transmitter-receiver pair uses
linear precoding so that effectively the signals are beam-formed
toward a direction that can not be attained by the eavesdropper
and is at the same time orthogonal to interference from the other
user.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Information theoretic security was introduced by Shannon
in [1], which studied the problem of transmitting conﬁdential
information in a communication system in the presence of
an eavesdropper with unbounded computation power. Since
then, a huge body of work has been devoted to studying
this problem for different network models by deriving fundamental transmission rate limits [2], [3] and designing lowcomplexity schemes to approach these limits in practice [4].
Recently a lot of efforts in information theoretic security
are made to address the problem that an eavesdropper is a
passive entity and hence its location or channel states can
not be accurately obtained by the legitimate parties. Several
different channel models have been proposed with the aim
to increase the robustness of a secrecy scheme when the
eavesdropper channel states are only known by distribution
[5], [6], or only available with delays [7], or only known to
take values in a ﬁnite set [8], [9].
As a more pessimistic but stronger assumption, references
[10], [11] study secrecy capacity when the eavesdropper
channel is arbitrarily varying and its channel states are
known to the eavesdropper only. Reference [11] studies the
single-user Gaussian multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channel and characterizes the so-called secrecy degrees of
freedom (s.d.o.f.), which is the pre-log of the secrecy capacity
at high SNR. The s.d.o.f. region of two user Gaussian MIMO
broadcast channel with an arbitrarily varying eavesdropper
channel was found in [12]. The s.d.o.f. region for two user
Gaussian MIMO multiple access channel and Gaussian twoway channel with the eavesdropper channel being arbitrarily

The Gaussian two-user MIMO interference channel with
an arbitrarily varying eavesdropper channel is shown in
Figure 1. The transmitter t, t = 1, 2 has NT,t antennas

NE = 1 antennas. During the ith channel use, the channel

Theorem 1: Let NE = 1, r(H1,1 ) = r(H2,2 ) = 2, then
the s.d.o.f. region is given by (8) if the following conditions
hold:

1 ≤ r(H2,1 ∨ H2,2 ) = r(H2,1 ) ≤ 2.

We next describe a non-trivial example, in the sense that
it is not known whether the region (9) is achievable for this
model. However the next theorem shows its s.d.o.f. region is
strictly greater than (8).
Theorem 2: Consider the single sided interference channel
shown in Figure 2, where

(4)

H1,1 = I2×2 , H2,2 = [02×1 , I2×2 ]2×3 ,
H2,1 = [I2×2 , 02×1 ]2×3 , H1,2 = 02×2 .

We require the limit in (4) to be uniform over all possible
sequences of eavesdropper channel states [11].
The secrecy rate for the message Wt , Rs,t , is deﬁned as
1
Rs,t = limn→∞ n H(Wt ), t = 1, 2 such that Wt can be
reliably decoded by receiver t and (4) is satisﬁed.
In this paper, we use the secrecy degrees of freedom
(s.d.o.f.) region as a characterization of the high SNR behavior of the secrecy capacity for this channel. The s.d.o.f.
region is deﬁned as:
{(d1 , d2 ) : dt = lim sup

For clarity, we shall use γ to represent a sequence of
˜
˜
{Hk (i), k = 1, 2} and use {Yγ (i)} to represent the outputs
of the eavesdropper channel that corresponds to this sequence
of eavesdropper channel states.
We assume the eavesdropper channel state information
˜
sequence {H(i)} is independent from {Xt (i), t = 1, 2}. In
this case, as shown in [11], the secrecy constraint can be
deﬁned as:

We ﬁrst need to transform the channel model so that it is
easier to analyze. In particular, it is desirable to decompose
at least three MIMO links of the interference channels, i.e.,
two intended links, and one interfering link, into parallel subchannels. The following lemma describes a special case for
which this is possible.

where |A| + |B| = r(H1,1 ), |B| + |C| = r(H2,1 ), |B| =
r(H1,1 ∧ H2,1 ). The noise random variables across the
sub-channels {zi }i∈A∪B∪C are independent and each is
distributed according to CN (0, 1). {x1i }i∈A∪B denote the
transmit symbols of user 1 and {x2i }i∈B∪C denote (a subset
of) the transmit symbols of user 2.
Receiver 2 observes

.

Due to Lemma 1, the channel after applying transformation
can be represented by Figure 3. We use Yo to represent
the NR,2 − r(H2,2 ) components in the signals observed by
receiver 2 which does not depend on signals transmitted
by user 2. Xo represents the signals transmitted by user
′
1 which can not be observed by receiver 1. Yk , k = 3, 4
represents the components in Yk that only depends on the
signals transmitted by user 1.
Since r (H1,1 ∧ H2,1 ) = 1, we have r(H2,1 ) ≥ 1. On the
other hand, there is no need to consider the case r(H2,1 ) = 1
separately, which corresponds to removing y3 in Figure 3.
This is because when proving converse for this case, we can
always reveal y3 to receiver 1 as genie information and apply
the converse described in this section.
Let {δn } denote the non-negative sequence that goes to 0
when n goes to inﬁnity. First assume the eavesdropper monn
itors X1 , then from Fano’s inequality and the conﬁdentiality
requirement on W1 , we have

(19)

r(H1,1 ∧H2,1 )×NT2

Note that the transformation will affect all channel matrices
of legitimate links due to changes in the representation
of transmitted signals. During the transformation we either
multiply Hi,j with nonsingular matrices or removing all zero
rows from H2,1 (which only affects the receiver). Hence it
does not change r(H2,1 ) or r(H2,1 ∨ H2,2 ).
From (14), we have

Next we assume the eavesdropper monitors Y5n . Then we
have:

where U, V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix
whose diagonal elements are the singular values of H′ .
2,2
The channel observed by receiver 2 can then be written as
following after canceling U:
Y2 = [(DVX′ )T ; 0]T + H1,2 X1 + Z2 .

In order to satisfy (20) for (19), the number of nonzero
columns of H2,2 (after applying the GSVD step above)
cannot exceed r(H2,2 ). Without loss of generality, we assume
the last NT,2 − r(H2,2 ) columns of H2,2 are zeros. We next
apply singular value decomposition to the remaining r(H2,2 )
columns of H2,2 , denoted by H′ which leads to:
2,2
Dr(H2,2 )×r(H2,2 )
0

r (H1,1 ∧ H2,1 ) = 1, r(H2,1 ∨ H2,2 ) = r(H2,1 ) = 2

DV is an invertible matrix, which can be canceled from (22)
without affecting s.d.o.f. region. Hence we obtain (18).
We next prove Theorem 1 in two cases. In both cases
the achievability followed directly from letting only one user
transmit at a time. Hence we only need to prove converse.

where X′ is the transmitted signals of user 2, which is
2
a r(H2,2 ) × 1 vector whose ﬁrst r(H2,1 ) components are
{x2i }i∈B∪C .
Proof Outline: We ﬁrst apply Generalized Singular
Value Decomposition (GSVD) to [H1,1 , H2,1 ]. It can be
shown that it is possible to transform the channel observed
by receiver 1 into the form (15)-(17) without affecting the
s.d.o.f. region of the channel [13]. After this transformation,
we can represent H2,1 as follows:

H′

Y4 = X3 + Y4′ + Z4 ˆ

Y5 = X4 + Y5′ + Z5

i ∈ B,

y1i = x1i + x2i + zi ,

H2,1 =

Y3 = X4 + Z3

X3

(14)

the channel can be transformed into the following form while
retaining the s.d.o.f. region: Receiver 1 observes a multiple
access channel composed of parallel links:

Let Xj,i denote the value of Xj during the ith channel

X3,i = 0, i mod M = 0 or M − 1,

Since the pre-log of h (X2 + X3 + Z2 |X1 , Y3n ) can not

we have

X2,i = 0

For these channel indices {i}, transmitter 1 performs linear
precoding over every three channel uses. This means, for i
such that i mod M = 1, ..., M − 2 and i + 1 mod 3 = 2,
Transmitter 1 computes the transmitted signals as:

For i such that i mod M = 1, ..., M − 2, Receiver 1 can

The channel gains ai , bi , ai−2 , bi−2 do not appear in these
signals because X2,i = 0 and X1,i−2 = 0. Equivalently,
since the eavesdropper knows its channel states {ai , bi }, we

(48)

had rank less than or equal to 2 and the eavesdropper had 1
antenna. The s.d.o.f. region for a class of this type of channel
models was found, which was achieved by allowing only
one user to transmit at a time. We also provided a nontrivial example for which we proved such a transmission
strategy was sub-optimal. The achievability proof for this
example introduced a new method in which the artiﬁcial
noise injected by the transmitter is aligned with interference
at its intended receiver through linear precoding. This enables
the transmitter to effectively jams the eavesdropper while the
receiver can nullify the interference and jamming signals at
the same time and achieves secrecy.

can represent the signals it received as following without any
loss of information:
U1,i + Ji ,
ai−1 (U1,i−1 + U2,i−2 ) + bi−1 (U1,i + U2,i−1 ) ,

(65)
(66)

U2,i−2 − Ji−1 .

(67)

Finally, let U2,i−1 = U1,i and U2,i−2 = U1,i−1 . The signals
observed by receiver 1 becomes
2U1,i + Z1,i + Z2,i−1 ,
2U1,i−1 + Z1,i−1 + Z2,i−2 .

(68)
(69)

The signals received by the eavesdropper becomes
U1,i + Ji ,

U1,i−1 − Ji−1 ,

ai−1 U1,i−1 + bi−1 U1,i .

B. Secrecy for User 1
For every three channel uses, the intended receiver obtains
two clear signals (68)-(69), while Eve gets one overlapping copy of signals (71) and two heavily jammed signals
(70). For this equivalent wiretap channel whose inputs are
[U1,i , U1,i−1 ], it can be shown by following [11] that a secrecy degree of freedom of 1 is achievable using a randomly
generated Gaussian codebook and random binning scheme
such that (68) is satisﬁed. By choosing a sufﬁciently large
M , this means d1 can be made arbitrarily close to 1/3 in the
original channel.
C. Secrecy of User 2
For transmitter 2, we view every M channel uses as a
single channel use. The effective channel inputs is a 2M × 1
complex vector XM,k , k ≥ 0 given by
[X4,Mk , X5,Mk , ..., X4,M(k+1)−1 , X5,M(k+1)−1 ].

(72)

Due to the restriction placed on (53), the equivalent eavesdropper channel is memoryless whose output is a M × 1
vector. The channel matrix is given by:


dk
ek

 −ci 0 di
ei


,
(73)


...
−cj 0 dj ej
M×2M
where the subscript of the tth row equals M k+t. The channel
is therefore a single-user MIMO-wiretap channel, in which
the transmitter and the receiver has 2M antennas, and the
eavesdropper has M antennas. In [11], it was shown that
there exists a codebook that achieves an s.d.o.f. of M for
this channel which satisﬁes (52). This translates to an s.d.o.f.
of d2 = 1 for the original channel.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we studied the Gaussian two-user interference
channel with an external eavesdropper, where the eavesdropper channel is arbitrarily varying and its state is known to
the eavesdropper only. We focused on the case where all
channel matrices between legitimate transmitter and receiver
