TS neither requires transmission of side information nor introduces nonlinear distortion, it is applicable to many systems
with severe EVM limitation.
TS was originally proposed for average power reduction
of QAM signals by Forney [4]. It was then applied to peak
power reduction of single-carrier signals in [5]. Recently, by
extending this approach, it is demonstrated in [6] that near
constant envelope single-carrier signals can be generated. On
the other hand, the application of TS to PAPR reduction of
OFDM signals was proposed in [7], and a low-complexity
technique that makes use of the autocorrelation property of
transmit symbols in frequency domain was proposed in [8].
More recently, the use of sequential decoding together with
a time-domain metric is proposed in [9] for computational
complexity reduction.
In general, TS for PAPR reduction requires constellation
expansion similar to coded modulations (CM), but unlike CM
it does not offer any error correcting capability. This indicates
that the relative noise margin is reduced. In other words, if
we compare the system with and without TS under the same
energy constraint per information bit, there is a performance
degradation for the former in terms of bit error rate (BER)
or corresponding required signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR)
unless average power is also reduced.
It is well known that channel coding is essential for
OFDM systems to achieve frequency diversity over frequencyselective fading channels. However, to the best of the authors’
knowledge, coded modulation performance of trellis shaped
OFDM system with PAPR reduction over frequency-selective
fading channels has not been rigorously investigated yet.
In this paper, we propose a serial concatenation of channel
coding and trellis shaping in the framework of OFDM with
PAPR reduction. To extract the soft output from the trellis
shaping bits that are originally designed for PAPR reduction,
a novel BJCR-based log likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation
is introduced. As outer binary codes, both low-density paritycheck (LDPC) codes and convolutional codes are investigated.
The resulting proposed system can be seen as a special form
of a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) [10, 11]. It will
be shown that the proposed serial concatenation of LDPC
codes and TS can signiﬁcantly improve the frame error rate
performance.

Abstract— Orthogonal
frequency-division
multiplexing
(OFDM) can achieve remarkable performance in terms of
spectral efﬁciency. However, its well-known drawback is that
the OFDM signals have high peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR), and this causes performance degradation in terms
of power ampliﬁer (PA) efﬁciency. Trellis shaping (TS) is an
effective method to reduce PAPR without signal distortion by
exploiting the trellis structure at the transmitter. In practice,
OFDM should be combined with channel coding in order to
achieve frequency diversity. In this paper, we propose a serial
concatenation of channel coding and trellis shaping such that
the frequency diversity effect and peak power reduction can
be simultaneously achieved. A novel BCJR-based LLR metric
calculation for trellis shaping bits is introduced for this purpose.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is conﬁrmed by
simulation over AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has
excellent performance in terms of spectral efﬁciency as well
as its robustness against frequency-selective fading channels.
OFDM signaling is thus adopted by various wireless communications systems, including wireless local area networks
(LAN) and 3GPP long term evolution (LTE). The well-known
drawback of the OFDM signal is its high peak-to-average
power ratio (PAPR). As a result, linear ampliﬁcation of OFDM
signal requires a large input back-off (IBO) operation of the
power ampliﬁer (PA) at the ﬁnal stage of the transmitter, and
this substantially degrades its power efﬁciency.
Various techniques have been proposed for PAPR reduction
of OFDM signals. One of the simplest methods is the deliberate clipping and ﬁltering (CAF) (e.g., [1, 2]). This approach
causes nonlinear in-band distortion and thus is difﬁcult to
be applied to the communication standards that have a strict
limitation in terms of error vector magnitude (EVM). Selected
mapping (SLM) [3] is another well-known approach but its
peak power reduction capability is limited, considering the
increase of transmitter complexity and the side information
overhead required for every OFDM symbol. Furthermore,
these two methods consider only PAPR reduction and they
in general may not be used for average power reduction.
Trellis shaping (TS) is known as a ﬂexible method to reduce
PAPR and average power of OFDM signals by controlling
signal transition exploiting the structure of trellis codes. Since

The FD metric is based on the fact that if the autocorrelation
of the transmitted symbol sequence in frequency domain is
close to an impulse, the resulting instantaneous power becomes
ﬂattened (and thus the PAPR becomes lower).
This metric is deﬁned as a sum of squares of the autocorrelation sidelobes:

II. T RELLIS S HAPING
We brieﬂy review the TS system for OFDM with PAPR
reduction. A basic block diagram of the general TS system is
described in Fig. 1. In this ﬁgure, G denotes the generator
(
)T
matrix of a convolutional code, HT and H−1
denote
the parity check matrix and its left inverse matrix for this
code, respectively. For a detailed description of trellis shaping
for PAPR reduction, we refer to [8]. In the framework of
trellis shaping, we control the signal transition by adding the
codeword from encoder G to the most signiﬁcant bits (MSB)
(
)T
encoded with H−1 , and for our scenario, we search for
a suitable codeword from G that minimizes the PAPR. In
this paper, we use a rate-1/2 code for shaping and a Viterbi
algorithm is used for searching for the codeword. As a metric
of ﬁnding the suitable codeword, one may either use a timedomain (TD) metric proposed in [7, 9] or a frequency-domain
(FD) metric proposed in [8]. In terms of PAPR distribution,
the TD metric with higher complexity may achieve better
performance [9]. Nevertheless, our previous study [12] shows
that the FD metric outperforms the TD metric in terms
of resulting bit error rates (BER) over nonlinear channels.
Therefore, in this paper, we only review and evaluate the
performance of the FD metric in what follows.
Throughout this paper, we consider the so-called sign-bit
shaping [4, 8] where each two-bit shaping output (as MSB)
chooses the quadrant of the QAM constellation. Furthermore,
as a QAM constellation mapping for TS, we consider the
use of Type-1 and Type-2 mappings described in [8]. Type1 mapping consists of an origin-symmetric mapping for LSB
and thus energy remains the same regardless of the selected
quadrants. Consequently, Type-1 mapping does not reduce the
average power and thus works exclusively for PAPR reduction.
On the other hand, the Type-2 mapping does not have this
property and is able to reduce both the peak and the average
power of OFDM signals.

Finally, the sequence A is converted to time domain samples
by (at least N -point) inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT).
By adding a guard interval of appropriate length and passing
the signal through a low-pass ﬁlter, we obtain a continuous
baseband OFDM signal.
III. C ODED M ODULATION F RAMEWORKS FOR T RELLIS
S HAPED OFDM
In this paper, we consider the coded trellis shaping system
in the form of serial concatenation of TS and channel coding
as described in Fig. 2. The bit interleaving and deinterleaving
are applied as shown in Fig. 2, where π denotes the bit
interleaver, and π −1 denotes the corresponding deinterleaver.
In this design, the information bits are encoded followed by
separate bit interleavers. The encoded bits are then separated
into MSBs and LSBs and former bits are encoded by (H−1 )T

for shaping. After shaping, the MSBs and LSBs, where the
merged and passed into the QAM mapper. At the receiver,
we calculate the log likelihood ratio (LLR) of each received
bit to enable soft decision decoding at the channel decoder.
By using this LLR sequence in the decoding process after
deinterleaving, one can decode the information. Different from
directly channel coded cases as in the conventional BICM,
the LLR calculation is somewhat complex in our model since
the MSBs are generated by shaping after channel coding. In
the following subsections, we detail our proposed calculation
process.
For reference, we also consider the channel coding without
bit interleaving, which corresponds to the system where the
interleavers and deinterleavers are simply removed from those
in Fig. 2.

the number of states of the trellis. In the BCJR algorithm, we
need to compute the forward recursion αi (l), the backward
b
recursion βi (l), and the branch metric γi (l , l), prior to calcu1

ﬁrst and second bit of the ith subcarrier, respectively.

With trellis shaping, hard decision is generally used for
MSBs since the soft output may not be directly retrieved. We
thus obtain the soft output of MSBs to improve the decoding
performance by employing the BCJR algorithm [13]. We ﬁrst
model the received OFDM symbol as follows. Let Yi denote
the ith subcarrier of the received signal, which can be written
as Yi = Hi Xi + Ni where Hi is the complex fading channel
coefﬁcient, Xi ∈ X is the transmitted symbol, and Ni is the
Gaussian noise term of the corresponding subcarrier. Note that
X is the set of M -QAM symbols to be transmitted and we
denote B = log2 M as the number of bits constituting the
symbol. With these notations, the bit likelihood for the jth bit
of the ith subcarrier, µb , where j ∈ {0, 1, · · · , B −1} and i ∈
i,j
{0, 1, · · · , N − 1}, is expressed by the a posteriori probability
that indicates which bit (b ∈ {0, 1}) was transmitted:

for i = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1, j = 1, 2, · · · , B − 2.

where
denotes the signal set whose jth bit is b ∈ {0, 1},
and C is a normalization constant which can be dropped in the
actual implementation. Also, N0 denotes the power spectral
density of AWGN.
To enable soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoding at the
receiver, we ﬁrst determine the trellis based on the compound
matrix [14] of (H−1 )T and G, and then employ a BCJR algorithm to it. For simplicity, we adopt the sign bit shaping and the
entire codeword of TS is matched to an OFDM symbol. In this
case, one bit out of B −1 bits is encoded by (H−1 )T , and each
subcarrier contains the corresponding two-bit outputs as MSB.
We denote the coded bits (prior to trellis shaping) carried by
the ith subcarrier as si = [s0 s1 · · · sB−2 ], and subsequently
i i

IV. S IMULATION R ESULTS
In this section, we evaluate frame error rate (FER) performance of the proposed system by computer simulation.
Throughout simulations, we consider the sign-bit shaping
described in [4, 8] for simplicity. The number of subcarriers
is chosen as 128, and each subcarrier is modulated by 256QAM constellation with either the Type-1 or Type-2 mapping.
As concatenated error correcting codes, we used a rate-6/7
LDPC code and the same rate punctured convolutional code
(CC). We set both the length of codeword of error correcting
codes and the size of interleaver to 896(= 128 × 7) bits to

match one OFDM symbol. In LDPC decoding, the maximum
iteration count is set to 50. The constraint length is chosen
as 3 for TS, and 7 for the convolutional code used for error
correction. Note that, these codes are selected from those with
maximum free distance. For complexity reduction, we apply
the trellis window truncation [8] with the normalized window
˜
size ∆ = 1/2 to the TS. From the above description, the
total coding rate of concatenated shaping system is calculated
as 3/4 for both LDPC code and CC concatenated case. For
comparison, we also show the performance of a rate-3/4
LDPC code without shaping. The codeword length of this
code is 1024 bits and the maximum iteration count is 50.
These parameters are chosen such that the overall bandwidth
efﬁciency is the same (i.e., 6 bits per symbol).
A. Peak Power Reduction Capability of TS

subcarrier OFDM system using 4-state TS (∆ = 1/2) with the Type-2
mapping over the AWGN channel.

Before we present the FER performance, we brieﬂy demonstrate the peak power reduction capabilities of TS. As a
criterion for evaluating the peak-power reducing effect, we use
the complementary cumulative distributed function (CCDF)
of the instantaneous power of these signals. Figure 3 shows
the CCDFs of normalized instantaneous power, for each of
Type-1 and Type-2 mapping. From this ﬁgure, it is observed
that we can considerably reduce the peak power compared
to the unshaped case. Comparing Type-1 and Type-2, the
former mapping can perform better, but the latter mapping
can reduce the average power by about 3 dB compared to
the unshaped case, while Type-1 has no capability of average
power reduction [8, 12].

at 10−3 is achieved by the concatenation of CC and LDPC
codes, respectively, compared to those without channel coding.
Moreover, for the case of LDPC concatenated shaping, the
improving effect of random interleaver can be observed. We
conjecture the reason for this behavior as follows: the builtin interleaver of LDPC code may not be sufﬁcient and some
check nodes thus refer to the LLR associated with TS in a
non-uniform manner, based on the fact that the interleaver
does not improve but rather degrades the performance of the
LDPC code without shaping.

B. FER Performance over an AWGN Channel

C. FER Performance over Rayleigh Fading Channel

Figures 4 and 5 show the FER performance of the proposed
system with Type-1 and Type-2 mappings, respectively, over
an AWGN channel. In both mappings, it is observed that
TS with channel coding can achieve better performance. We
observe that a gain in terms of Eb /N0 of about 2 dB and 5 dB

The FER performance over frequency-selective 4-path
Rayleigh fading channel is shown in Figs. 6 and 7 for
Type-1 and Type-2 mapping, respectively. For the simulated
frequency-selective channel, a guard interval (GI) of length
T /4 is inserted per OFDM symbol, where T is the OFDM

been shown that the use of LDPC codes for channel coding
considerably outperforms the uncoded as well as CC-coded
TS cases in both of AWGN and frequency-selective Rayleigh
fading channels.
For our future work, we will make further investigations on
the performance of coded trellis shaping over the nonlinear
channels.

symbol length, and the delay spread is set shorter than the
length of the GI. We also assume that the receiver has an ideal
channel state information (CSI) and uses this information at
the channel decoder to retrieve the original information bits
correctly. Even though the performance over fading channels
degrades in general, a similar tendency to the case of AWGN
channel is observed. In particular, considerable performance
gain can be achieved by channel coding compared to the
uncoded case because of the effect of frequency diversity.
Moreover, in this channel, a bit interleaving always improves
the performance for coded cases.
