Abstract—The value of relay nodes to enhance the error
performance versus rate trade-off in wireless networks has
been studied extensively. However, wireless nodes currently are
constrained to only transmit or receive at a given frequency,
i.e., half-duplex constraint. The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
(DMT) for half-duplex networks are less understood. In the
special cases where the DMT is currently known, such as the relay
channel and the line network, it is achieved by either dynamic
decoding or a quantize-map-forward (QMF) strategy with a ﬁxed
half-duplex schedule. The main question we investigate in this
paper is whether these two strategies are sufﬁcient to achieve the
DMT of half-duplex wireless networks or we need new strategies
for general setups. We propose a generalization of the two existing
schemes through a dynamic QMF strategy and show that in a
parallel relay channel it outperforms both earlier schemes. We
also establish the DMT for the relay channel with multiple relays
and multiple antennas in some special cases.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) [2] captures
the inherent tension between rate and reliability over fading
channels. It has been used to demonstrate the value of relays
in wireless networks [3], [4], [5], [6]. The two critical issues
that complicate the problem in relay networks is who knows
what channel state and whether nodes can listen and transmit
at the same time (i.e., half or full duplex). The DMT of fullduplex wireless networks can be fully characterized, even with
only receiver channel knowledge, which can be forwarded
to the destination. For example, it can be achieved by a
quantize-map-and-forward (QMF) strategy introduced in [1].
This is a simple consequence of the fact that QMF achieves
the capacity of wireless relay networks within a constant gap
without requiring (transmit) channel state information (CSI)
at the relays [1].
In current wireless systems, nodes operate in a half-duplex
mode, i.e., they can not simultaneously transmit and receive
signals on the same frequency band. Designing DMT optimal
strategies for half-duplex networks is more challenging as it
also involves an optimization over the listen and transmit times
for the relays. In a fading environment where transmit CSI
is unavailable at the nodes, such a listen-transmit schedule
needs to be either ﬁxed or depend only on local receive CSI.
Characterizing the DMT of general half-duplex relay networks
remains as an open problem, despite interesting progress in
some special cases (see [7], [9] and references therein).

This work is particularly motivated by three recent results
that characterize the DMT in three basic relaying setups:
•

•

•

[10] shows that the optimal DMT for the relay channel with N non-interfering relays (see Figure 1-(a))
is achieved by the QMF scheme with a ﬁxed RX-TX
schedule for the half-duplex relays that does not depend
on the channel realizations. The performance meets the
full-duplex DMT.
[12] shows that the DMT for the line relay network (see
Figure 1-(b)) is achieved by dynamic decode-and-forward
(DDF) [7]. In DDF the relay listens until it gathers
enough mutual information to decode the transmitted
message so its RX time is dynamically determined as
a function of its backward channel realization and the
targeted rate. The optimal performance does not reach
the full-duplex DMT. The result generalizes to multiple
hops and multiple transmit and receive antennas at the
realays.
[13] shows that to achieve the DMT of a single relay
channel with multiple antennas at the relay node (see
Figure 1-(c)) we need both of the above strategies. In this
case there is a regime where DDF achieves the optimal
DMT when ﬁxed schedules are sub-optimal, and there is a
second regime where a ﬁxed schedule with QMF achieves
the optimal DMT when DDF is strictly suboptimal.
However, the optimal DMT does not necessarily meet
the full-duplex DMT anymore.1 .

It can be show that in all other scenarios [8], [9], [11] where

the initially submitted version of this paper. After [13] was brought to our
attention by the reviewers, we have removed this part from the ﬁnal version
of the paper. A subtlety regarding this result is discussed in Section III

the optimal DMT is achieved by another strategy, it can be also
achieved by one of two strategies above, moreover with the
added beneﬁt of avoiding extra requirements such as transmit
CSI at the relay as in [8]. Therefore, the current results in
the literature exhibit the following dichotomy: in all cases
where the DMT of half-duplex relay networks is known it
is either achieved by DDF where the relay waits until it can
fully decode the source message, or by QMF with a ﬁxed
schedule independent of the channel realizations. A natural
generalization of these two strategies is dynamic QMF where
a relay listens for a fraction of time determined by its receive
CSI that is not necessarily long enough to allow decoding of
the transmitted message. The relay then quantizes maps and
forwards the received signal as in the original QMF [1]. The
goal of this paper is to understand whether this additional
ﬂexibility for the dynamic schedule is critical.
To make progress on this question, we ﬁrst consider a
natural generalization of the setups in [10] and [13], the relay
channel with N non-interfering multiple-antenna relays. We
are able to characterize the DMT of this setup for a class of
antenna conﬁgurations. However, the optimal DMT is again
achieved by QMF with ﬁxed schedules. We then turn to
a conﬁguration of two parallel relays and demonstrate that
DQMF outperforms both earlier schemes in this case. This
example establishes the necessity of DQMF for achieving the
DMT of general wireless networks.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a wireless network where a source S and a destination D want to communicate with the help of half-duplex
relays. In this paper we focus on two simple conﬁgurations depicted in Figure 2-(a) and (b) and studied in Sections IV and V
respectively. In the ﬁrst case, the communication from a singleantenna source to a single-antenna destination is assisted by
multiple relays with multiple antennas. The source signal is
broadcasted to the relays and the relay signals superpose at
the destination. A direct link between the source and the
destination may or may not be present. Figure 2-(a) shows
a special case with one two-antenna relay and two singleantenna relays. In the second setup, the source communicates
to the destination through two independent line networks. As
opposed to the ﬁrst setup, here there is no broadcast at the

2

source or superposition at the destination. The two relays can
be thought of as operating at two different frequencies. Each
of the two relays is equipped with a single antenna in this
case.
All channels are assumed to be ﬂat-fading, i.e. the channel
gains for every link depicted in Figure 2 (from a transmit
to a receive antenna) are i.i.d. circularly-symmetric complex
Gaussian random variables CN (0, 1). We assume quasi-static
fading, i.e. the channel gains remain constant over the duration
of the codeword and change independently from one codeword
to another. The channel realizations are known at the receivers
but not at the transmitters. The additive noise at the receivers
is CN (0, 1). All nodes in the system are subject to the same
average power constraint speciﬁed by the average signal to
noise power ratio SNR.
A scheme, consisting of a family of codes {CSNR } indexed
by SNR with rate R(SNR) and average error probability
Pe (SNR) is said to achieve a multiplexing gain r and diversity
gain d if [2]

We consider codes with sufﬁciently long codewords so that
the error event is dominated by outage, the event that the
capacity of the system falls below the targeted rate. For each
r, the supremum d(r) of the diversity gain achievable over all
families of codes is called the DMT of the system.

III. R ELAY WITH M ULTIPLE A NTENNAS
In this section, we state the DMT of the half-duplex relay
channel in Figure 1-(c).
Theorem 3.1: The DMT for the half-duplex relay channel
with n transmit and receive antennas at the relay in Figure 1(c) is given by

1
 (n + 1)(1 − r) 0 ≤ r < (n+1)

(n + 1) − 1−r (n+1) ≤ r < 1
d(r) =
2

1
2(1 − r)
2 ≤ r ≤ 1.

When 0 ≤ r ≤ 1/2, the optimal DMT is achieved by
dynamic decode and forward (DDF) at the relay. When
1/2 < r ≤ 1, the DMT optimal strategy is quantize-mapand-forward (QMF) at the relay with a ﬁxed half RX-half
TX schedule. The full-duplex performance is reached only for
0 ≤ r < 1/(n + 1). See Figure 3 for the case of two antennas
at the relay.
This result was part of our ISIT submission, but reviewers
pointed out [13] which had obtained this result. The only

shown in a). Each of the three states in b,c,d are active a fraction 1/3 of the
total time.

subtle difference in our approach is that the upper bounds on
the DMT tradeoff differ from [13] since they are based on the
general upper bound on the capacity of arbitrary half-duplex
relay networks derived in [14, Section VI]. The upper bound in
[14, Section VI] allows for both random (message dependent)
schedules and for optimization of the transmit powers across
different transmit and receive states of the network. This
covers possible message dependent schedules that a simpler
time schedule based upper bound does not cover. However, it
then shows that the gain from such techniques is bounded by
a constant independent of SNR, and hence can not impact the
DMT tradeoff.
IV. M ULTIPLE R ELAYS WITH M ULTIPLE A NTENNAS
In this section, we characterize the DMT of the relay
channel with N relays each with ni transmit and receive
antennas for i = 1, . . . , N when antenna conﬁgurations satisfy
a speciﬁc property. The result is summarized in the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.1: Let ni , i = 1, . . . , N be such that the relay
nodes can be grouped into k sets, each set containing the
same total number of antennas (equal to i ni /k) . Then a
QMF strategy with a ﬁxed schedule where every set receives
a fraction 1/k of the total time and transmits a fraction 1/k
achieves the full-duplex DMT. The full-duplex DMT is given
by d(r) = (1 − r) i ni when there is no direct link between
the source and the destination and d(r) = (1 − r)(1 + i ni )
when the direct link is present.
Figure 2-(a) illustrates one such conﬁguration. Note that
by grouping the two single-antenna relays together, we obtain
two sets of relays each with a total number of 2 antennas.
The optimal ﬁxed schedule is to have the multiple-antenna
relay listen half the time to the source node when the two
single antenna relays are simultaneously transmitting to the
destination. In the remaining half, the multiple-antenna relay
is transmitting to the destination while the single-antenna
relays are listening. Figure 4 illustrates the corresponding ﬁxed
schedule when k = 3. Note that if the multiple antenna relay
in Figure 2-(a) contained three antennas instead of two, the
network would fail to satisfy the condition in Theorem 4.1.
Another conﬁguration that fails to satisfy the condition is the
relay channel with multiple antennas in Figure 1-(c) for which
we know that QMF with ﬁxed schedules is not optimal in
certain regimes and the optimal DMT does not meet the fullduplex DMT (see Section III and [13]).
Proof of Theorem 4.1: We consider the case where the direct
link between the source and the destination is not present.
Let us enumerate the antennas at the relays as i = 1, . . . , m

3

where m = i ni and let hsi and hid be the channel gains
between the antenna i and the source and the destination nodes
respectively. Let K1 , . . . , Kk be the k sets of relays each
containing an equal total number of antennas. The performance
of the QMF strategy in half-duplex networks under a ﬁxed
RX-TX schedule for the relays is lower bounded in [1,
Section VIII-C]. For the schedule in Figure 4, where each set
K1 , . . . , Kk listens and transmits a fraction 1/k of the total
time such that there is a single set that listens and a single set
that transmits at any given time, the performance of QMF is
lower bounded by RQM F ≥ Ch.d. − κ where κ is a constant

V. DYNAMIC QMF
In the dynamic QMF (DQMF) strategy relays listen for a
fraction of time, which is a function of their received CSI
and then quantize, map, and forward the received signal as in
the original QMF [1]. Clearly this generalizes DDF as well,
since if the receive time is sufﬁcient to decode, the difference
between decoding and quantizing the received signal is the
removal or forwarding of the additive noise correspondingly,
which does not matter at high-SNR. It is applicable to general
networks, but all the difﬁculty is then encapsulated in the
(dynamic) choice of the receive times. To understand whether
this additional ﬂexibility is critical, we focus on a speciﬁc
network.2
We consider the setup in Figure 2-(b) where S communicates to D with the help of two parallel half-duplex relays.
For this network, we demonstrate that the DQMF strategy
outperforms both DDF and the static QMF for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1/2.
See Figure 5.
1) QMF with ﬁxed RX-TX schedules: The performance of
the QMF strategy when the the relays listen for a fraction
t1 and t2 of the time and transmit a fraction (1 − t1 ) and
(1−t2 ) respectively is lower bounded in [1, Section VIII-C] by
RQM F ≥ Ch.d. (t1 , t2 ) − κ where κ is a constant independent
of SNR and Ch.d. (t1 , t2 ) is given by

dQM F (r) = 2 − 2r.
The dominant outage event occurs when one of two channels
in each path are strong, say α = η = 1, and the remaining two
channels have a total of 2r multiplexing gain, i.e γ + β = 2r.
2) Upper Bound on the DMT Trade-off: In [14, Section VI],
we derive an upper bound on the capacity of half-duplex relay
networks, when all the channels are globally known, which
allows to optimize the transmit and receive schedule for the
relays based on global knowledge of instantaneous channel
realizations. For the setup in Figure 2-(b), this upper bound
yields
C≤

max

t1 (hs1 ,hs2 ,h2d ,h2d )
t2 (hs1 ,hs2 ,h2d ,h2d )

Ch.d. (t1 , t2 ) + G

where G is a constant independent of SNR and t1 and t2 can
be optimized as a function of the channel gains. In terms of
the multiplexing gain rC of the system, we have
rC ≤

max

t1 (α,γ,η,β)
t2 (α,γ,η,β)

min(t1 α, (1 − t1 )γ) + min(t2 η, (1 − t2 )β).

The right hand side is maximized by the choice t1 = γ/(α+γ)
and t2 = β/(η + β). Therefore, we get the following upper
bound on the DMT of parallel channel in Fig. 1-(b),

Note that for 0 ≤ r ≤ 1/2, α = 1, η = 1, β = r/(1 − r)
and γ = 0 (or any symmetrical conﬁguration), and for 1/2 ≤

in the domain of the optimization problem above. Therefore,

to observe that the optimal ﬁxed schedule for each relay

2 In the reference [13] pointed to us in the review process a dynamic QMF
strategy based on [1, Section VIII-C] is proposed where the switching times
are optimized based on the entire network state as in [1, Section VIII-C]. In
our terminology, we only use received CSI at the relays for determining the
switching schedules and hence what we term as DQMF is different from [13].

This upper bound is depicted in Figure 5.
3) Dynamic Decode and Forward: It is easy to verify that in
this case, DDF has the same performance as the static QMF. In
DDF, each relay waits until it is able to decode the transmitted
message, i.e., for the ﬁrst relay t1 = r/α and for the second
relay t2 = r/η. The scheme is in outage as soon as both
α < r and η < r, in which case none of the relays ever
get to transmit. Therefore, for the DMT of DDF, we have
dDDF (r) ≤ 2−2r. An alternative strategy could be to split the

information stream into two streams each of multiplexing gain
r/2 and send them over the two orthogonal paths while relays
perform DDF of the individual streams, i,e t1 = r/2α and
t2 = r/2η. Communication is in outage if one of the streams
is in outage which happens when α < r/2. This means the
diversity at rate r is 1 − r/2, even worse.
4) Dynamic QMF: Now we want to show that a dynamic
QMF strategy, where the RX times for the two relays depend
on the backward channel realizations can perform better than
the ﬁxed half-half schedule when 0 ≤ r ≤ 1/2. Consider
the following dynamic QMF strategy. For a ﬁxed x, let the
x
ﬁrst relay listen for a fraction t1 = x+α of the total duration
for communication, then quantize its received signal, map it
to a new codeword and transmit it in the remaining (1 − t1 )
fraction of the time. Similarly, the second relay listens for
x
a fraction t2 = x+η of the total time. Note that because t1
and t2 depend on the backward channel realizations α and η,
this is a dynamic strategy. When contrasted with the upper
bound in part-2 above, the relays here decide on their Rx
times by assuming that the channels at the second stage have
multiplexing gain x. (We assume that this forward channel
information is not available at the relays, otherwise they could
simply choose the x’s as γ and β respectively as in the upper
bound derivation and achieve the upper bound derived in part2.) x will be later optimized as a function of r to achieve the
best performance at every r. For now, it is a ﬁxed constant
such that 2r ≤ x ≤ 1.
The motivation behind this strategy is the following: when
the channels in the ﬁrst stage are weak (in particular 2r or
smaller as in the outage event for the ﬁxed half-half schedule),
this strategy allocates more time to the ﬁrst stage. On the other
hand, if they are strong (larger than x), the strategy allocates
more time for the second stage which helps in case the second
stage turns out to be weak. Therefore, it tries to balance the two
stages of the communication by looking only at the realization
of the backward channel at the relays. The RX times do not
necessarily allow the relays to be able to decode the source
message, therefore the strategy does not reduce to DDF.
The performance of the QMF strategy established in [1,
Section VIII-C] also holds under dynamic schedules. DMT of
this strategy is given by

The following proposition lower bounds dDQM F (r).
Proposition 5.1:

dDQM F (r) ≥ min(2 − xr − r, 2 −
x−r
From the proposition, the DMT for DQMF is maximized
when x is chosen such that x2 − rx − r = 0. The resulting
performance is depicted in Fig. 5.
We skip the proof of the proposition due to space constraints
and below only summarize the dominant outage events considering the following three cases separately: the information

5

transfer is limited by 1) the ﬁrst hop for both relays; 2)
the second hop for both relays; 3) the ﬁrst hop for the ﬁrst
relay and the second hop for the second relay. These cases
correspond to the following conditions
1) γ ≥ x and β ≥ x: In this case the condition (3) becomes
(x/(x + α))α + (x/(x + η))η ≤ r. The dominant outage
event is α = 0 and η = rx/(x − r) (or vice a versa),
γ = β = 1, which yields dDQM F (r) = 2 − rx/(x − r).
2) γ ≤ x and β ≤ x: In this case the condition (3) becomes
(α/(x + α))γ + (η/(x + η))β ≤ r. The dominant outage
event is α = 1 and η = 1, β = 0 and γ = r(x + 1),
which yields dDQM F (r) = 2 − r(x + 1).
3) γ ≥ x and β ≤ x: In this case the condition (3) becomes
(x/(x + α))α + (η/(x + η))β ≤ r. The dominant outage
events are α = 0 and η = 1, β = r(x + 1) and γ = 1,
and α = rx/(x − r) and η = 1, γ = 1, and β = 0, which
yield dDQM F (r) = min(2 − rx/(x − r), 2 − r(x + 1)).
Note that the case γ ≤ x and β ≥ x is analogous due to
the symmetry in the problem.
