base stations were proposed recently in [3]. Unfortunately, in
all these techniques SINR values remain ﬁnite and do not grow
indeﬁnitely with the number of base station antennas M .
In this paper we allow a limited collaboration between base
stations and propose an outer multi-cellular pre-coding, which
we call pilot contamination pre-coding. In the asymptotic
regime, as M tends to inﬁnity, this precoding allows us to
construct interference free multi-cell wireless systems. We
further proceed with analysis of LSASs with ﬁnite M .
The paper is organized as follows. First, in Section II, we
describe our system model, assumptions, and TDD protocol.
Then, in Section III, we explain the pilot contamination
problem and show that the pilot contamination results in intercell interference that does not vanish as the number of base
station antennas M is growing. In Section IV we propose
the pilot contamination precoding and show that it allows
achieving interference free TDD LSASs. Finally, in Section
V we derive estimates for SINRs and a capacity lower bound
for the case of LSASs with PCP and ﬁnite number of antennas
M.

Abstract—An LSAS entails a large number (tens or hundreds)
of base station antennas serving a much smaller number of
terminals, with large gains in spectral-efﬁciency and energyefﬁciency compared with conventional MIMO technology. Until
recently it was believed that in multi-cellular LSAS, even in
the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends
to inﬁnity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular
interference. The interference results from unavoidable re-use of
reverse-link pilot sequences (pilot contamination) by terminals in
different cells.
We devise a new concept that leads to the effective elimination of inter-cell interference in TDD LSAS systems. This
is achieved by outer multi-cellular pre-coding, which we call
pilot contamination pre-coding (PCP). The main idea of PCP
is that each base station linearly combines messages aimed to
terminals from different cells that re-use the same pilot sequence.
Crucially, the combining coefﬁcients depend only on the slowfading coefﬁcients between the terminals and the base stations.
Each base station independently transmits its PCP-combined
symbols using conventional linear pre-coding that is based on
estimated fast-fading coefﬁcients. Further we derive estimates for
SINRs and a capacity lower bound for the case of LSASs with
PCP and ﬁnite number of antennas M .

I. I NTRODUCTION
The exponential increase in demand for high data rates, as
well as the higher user density in cellular networks require
new ways of mitigating interference allowing a larger number
of users to share bandwidth. This, along with the Green Touch
initiative to decrease the power consumption in communications networks, motivates the analysis of cellular systems with
a very large number of base station (BTS) antennas. Such
systems have been studied extensively.
In [5], [1] the authors derived estimates for SINR values
in a non-cooperative cellular network in which the number of
BTS antennas tends to inﬁnity. It is shown in [5], [1], that not
all interference vanishes, and therefore, SINR does not grow
indeﬁnitely. The reason is that the channel estimates made
at the BTS contain not only the desired channel vector and
additive white noise, but also components directed towards
users from other cells who are assigned non-orthogonal pilot
sequences.
A number of techniques were proposed for achieving higher
SINRs. The numerical results obtained in [5], [1], [2] show
that these techniques provide breakthrough data transmission
rates for noncooperative cellular networks. Advanced networkMIMO TDD systems that allow some collaboration between

We consider a cellular network composed of L hexagonal
cells, each consisting of a central M -antenna base station and
K single-antenna terminals that share the same bandwidth.
We assume that Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) is used. Consequently, we consider a ﬂat-fading
channel model for each OFDM subcarrier. For a given subcarrier we denote by
gmikl = hmikl

βikl

(1)

the channel (propagation) coefﬁcient between the m-th antenna of the i-th BTS and the k-th terminal of the l-th cell,
Fig. 1. The ﬁst factor in (1) is the fast fading coefﬁcient
hmikl ∼ CN (0, 1). The second factor in (1) is slow fading
coefﬁcient (log normal and geometric decay). Coefﬁcients βikl
are constant with respect to frequency and BTS antenna index.
The channel coefﬁcients of the i-th base station form the
channel vector gikl = (g1ikl , g2ikl , . . . , gM ikl ) ∈ C1×M , and
the corresponding fast fading coefﬁcients form fast fading vector hikl = (h1ikl , h2ikl , . . . , hM ikl ) ∈ C1×M . We assume that
fading coefﬁcients are i.i.d. and therefore hikl ∼ CN (0, IM ).

where zi ∈ CM ×K is the additive noise. Without loss of
generality, we assume that the entries of zi are i.i.d. CN (0, 1)
random variables and that all gains are scaled accordingly.
The i-th base station estimates the vectors giki for terminals

where zi = √τ ρk ∼ CN (0, τ 1 r IM ). The estimate (3) is

contaminated, as it involves the channel vectors of users from
different cells that use pilot ψk .
The base station uses the estimates giki for computing
ˆ
precoding beamforming vectors. For M → ∞ it is convenient
to use conjugate beam-forming deﬁned by

Fig. 1. The channel coefﬁcient gmikl between the m-th antenna of the i-th
cell and the k-th terminal in the l-th cell

We further assume that the fast fading channels of different
terminals are statistically independent.
We assume a time block fading model. Thus fast fading
vectors hikl stay constant during coherence intervals of T
OFDM symbols. These vectors are assumed to be independent
in different coherence blocks.
We assume reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels, i.e. that βikl and hmikl are the same for these channels.
Let us consider a Time-Division Duplexing (TDD) scheme,
Fig. 2. Each coherence interval is organized in four phases:
• ﬁrst, each terminal sends uplink data to its BTS;

The analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the SINR was
conducted in [5] for the precoding deﬁned in (4) and in [1]
for precoding (5). Below we summarize the obtained results.
We assume precoding (5). The following well known
Lemma will be useful for us.

Below we describe details of this protocol for downlink
transmission. We assume that K terminals located in the same
sell use orthogonal pilots. The maximum number of orthogonal
τ -tuples is τ , therefore K ≤ τ . The coherence intervals
of fast moving terminals are short, typically T ∈ [4, 30].
So τ should be small. Therefore users in the neighboring
cells unavoidably use nonorthogonal pilots, or reuse the same
pilots. We assume that in all cells the same set ψ1 , . . . , ψτ of
†
orthogonal pilots (ψi ψj = δij ) is used. While not optimal,
this choice completely eliminates intra-cell interference as
M → ∞, as we detail below.
The k-th terminals in all cells synchronously send ψk . The
i-th base station receives the M × τ matrix

First, we assume that all signals qki are accessible to all
base stations across the entire network.
• Second, we assume that the slow fading coefﬁcients βikl
can be accurately estimated and made available to all base
stations or alternatively to a network hub.
Remark We assume that qki and βikl are accessible across
the entire network only to obtain a simple theoretical model.
In a real system it will be enough if qki and βikl are available
only to a limited number of cell neighboring the i-th cell.
We would like to point out that the slow fading coefﬁcients
βikl are easy to estimate since they are constant over the M
antennas, frequency, and over many time slots. In a typical
system with 20MHz bandwidth and the useful symbol duration
of 2/3 × 100 microseconds there are about 1400 tones per
OFDM symbol. We assign to each terminal a dedicated OFDM
tone. The terminals transmit pilots of duration 1 (for instance
ψkl = 1 for all k and l), simultaneously in the assigned tones.
The i-th base station receives in the appropriate tone: yi =

It is easy to see that

In (6) Ski is the signal power and all other terms Sk l ,
contribute to interference. From (9) we see that only the
terminals that use the same pilot ψk create interference that
does not vanish as M → ∞. The reason for this is that the
beamforming vectors of these terminals contain components
directed towards the k-th terminal in the i-th cell generating
directed interference that does not vanish as M → ∞. The
variance of the additive noise, however, is unitary regardless
of the number of BTS antennas, thus rendering the effect of
the noise null in the asymptotic region.
Equations (8) and (9) deﬁne the asymptotic behavior of the
numerator an denominator of the SINR, which are formed
of independent variables. Therefore, we have the following
theorem (analysis for uplink is similar).
Theorem 1. [5] [1] The downlink SINR of the k-th terminal
in the i-th cell for precoding (4) is

M i
So we need only one OFDM symbol for getting these estimates. Terminals that are located in remote cells can reuse
the same OFDM tone. If this separation is not enough the
terminals may use orthogonal pilots ψkl of length n. In this
case the same estimation procedure can be applied and only
every (1400 × n)-th terminal will be reusing the same pilot.
Now we re-examine equation (6). Instead of treating the
terms Qkl as interference and estimating their powers, we look

Applying Lemma 1 we obtain

The SINR values from Theorem 1 can be improved by
different techniques (for instance, we can allow different
transmit powers ρf,l ; their optimization gives a signiﬁcant gain
in SINRs [1]). In all these techniques, however, the SINRs
do not grow with M . One may try to use network MIMO
approach for canceling the inter-cell interference. Network
MIMO, however, is based on the assumption that the base
stations send to each other estimates gikl , which is not feasible
ˆ
in LSAS systems.
One possible conclusion of these arguments can be that
in both noncooperative LSASs and LSASs with cooperation
SINRs do not grow with M beyond certain limits. Below
we show that this conclusion is wrong. We demonstrate
that a limited collaboration between base stations allows us
to radically resolve the pilot contamination problem and to
construct interference free LSASs.
We make the following assumption on collaboration between base stations.

Thus, under our network assumptions, we constructed a noise

(30) corresponds to channel estimation error, (31) to nonorthogonal channels, (32) to beam-forming gain uncertainty,
and (33) to pilot-contamination. All these noise components
are mutually uncorrelated.
