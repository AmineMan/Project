scheme for 2-D equalization. Marrow and Wolf [7] considered
2-D DFE and MAP-DFE hybrid equalization schemes over an
L−shaped ISI channel. Wu et al [8] developed 2-D iterative
detection and decoding scheme for a separable 2-D ISI system.
In most practical systems, 2-D ISI is generally non-separable.
Shental et al [9] developed a generalized belief propagation
approach that achieves near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance for 2-D ISI channels. Simulations in [9] considered
(20×20) 2-D data sizes with smaller 2-D ISI masks (2×2). It is
practically difﬁcult to simulate conditions for higher ISI shapes
and sizes using the method in [9]. In a recent prior work, Chen
et al [10] developed an iterative soft-decision feedback zigzag MAP algorithm. This method demonstrated performance
close to nearly optimal detection with lower complexity and
compared well with the method presented in [9].
In this paper we are interested in iterative multi-row/column
MAP detectors for handling 2-D ISI. In section II, we derive
the general form of the multi-track MAP detector considering
the feedback information from neighboring bit cells outside
local 2-D ISI span. We use this algorithm subsequently
to develop a 2-D iterative multi-row/column turbo-detector.
Simulation results over the AWGN channel are discussed in
section III with concluding remarks in section IV. The main
contribution of this work is a set of low complexity tractable
2-D detection methods based on the turbo principle.

Abstract—We develop several novel signal detection algorithms
for two-dimensional intersymbol-interference channels. The core
in all these schemes is a modiﬁed one-dimensional maximum aposteriori (MAP) detection algorithm that operates over single
and multiple rows providing a balanced performance vs. complexity tradeoff. We explore 2-D iterative algorithms that operate
by feeding extrinsic information from multi-row/column detectors
in a turbo fashion. Multi-row/column MAP detection using 2D turbo-processing yields more than 2 dB signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) gain compared to a non-iterative multi-row detector over
the additive white Gaussian channel and within 0.1 dB of the
ML estimate.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Two-dimensional (2-D) intersymbol-interference (ISI) channels have become practically relevant in various data recording technologies such as two-dimensional magnetic recording
(TDMR), optical holographic memories [1] [2] as well as in
other areas such as pixelated wireless optical channels [3] and
2-D grid networks. From a signal processing view point, data
recording systems in 2-D have advantages over traditional 1D systems. 2-D recording systems are less sensitive to timing
instabilities due to wider read sensory elements for tracking
timing drifts. With efﬁcient 2-D signal detection methods,
guard bands between 2-D coded blocks can be eliminated,
thereby, improving format efﬁciency. Thus, 2-D ISI can be
beneﬁcially combatted to realize SNR gains by clever signal
processing.
There is a wide spectrum of 1-D detection techniques
ranging from decision feedback equalization (DFE) to the
optimal MAP algorithm that can be extended to the 2-D case.
2-D DFE methods are easy to implement but suffer from error
propagation. The 1-D MAP algorithm is theoretically optimal
and is the best-in-class detector for minimizing bit-error rate.
However, unlike 1-D MAP detection [4] that can be practically
realized, 2-D MAP detection is NP-complete [5]. It is difﬁcult
to realize a 2-D trellis spanning signal dimensions greater
than just a few bits. We need low complexity 2-D signal
detection algorithms based on 1-D schemes to get close to
near optimal 2-D MAP detection performance. Several authors
have considered various approaches towards 2-D detection.
Nelson et al [6] derived a multi-dimensional decision feedback

II. T WO D IMENSIONAL D ETECTION A LGORITHMS
Consider the detection of an M × N equiprobable 2-D
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary signal
x with elements x(k, l) ∈ {−1, +1} from received image y
with elements
y(m, n) = g(m, n) + w(m, n),

(1)

where g(m, n) is the 2-D convolution, deﬁned as
g(m, n) =
k

l

h(m − k, n − l)x(k, l).

(2)

In the above equations h(k, l) are the elements of a 2-D
ﬁnite impulse response/2-D blurring mask and w(m, n) are
zero mean i.i.d. Gaussian random variables (r.v.s). The double
sum is computed over the non-zero support of h(m− k, n− l).
The discrete model in (1) and (2) is applicable to most 2-D

ISI based storage channels post front-end signal processing
after dealing with channel/media distortions and whitening the
media noise.
We present 2-D non-iterative and iterative MAP based
detection algorithms in this work and compare their efﬁcacies
with single row/column and multi-row/column variations. The
trellis of the multi-row/column detector is compliant with the
span of the 2-D ISI, while the single-row/column version is
approximated by a simpliﬁed 1-D MAP trellis with much
lower complexity.

βi,j (s) = P {yi,a }j+1≤a≤N |Sj = s ,

We choose a generalized mask shown in part (a) of
Figure 1. The coefﬁcients [β −K1 , · · · , β−1 , 1, β1 , · · · , βK1 ]
denote
horizontal
ISI,
and
the
coefﬁcients
[α−K2 , · · · , α−1 , 1, α1 , · · · , αK2 ] denote vertical ISI. The
size of this mask is (2K2 + 1) × (2K1 + 1). The coefﬁcients
with negative indices denote the causal part; while the
positive indices denote the anti-causal part. Practical 2-D
runlength-limited ISI channels in recording systems [13]
could be represented by this ‘band-aid’ shape mask. In
practice, the span of 2-D diagonal interference over arbitrary
ISI shapes is small due to the physical constraints [11].
Though we choose an asymmetric runlength-limited shaped
mask throughout this paper for the sake of illustration, this
assumption can be readily generalized for any arbitrary 2-D
ISI shape within our framework.
As in the conventional BCJR algorithm [4], we do the scan
based on the forward-backward procedure. To compute the
received image y, we assume a boundary of −1 pixels around
x; the detector uses this boundary condition so that the MAP

the state transition probability γ is computed at every stage
along the trellis. Using the branch metrics (γ’s), the α and β
terms are computed using the forward-backward recursion:
αi,j (s) =

αi,j−1 (s )γi,j (s , s),

βi,j (s)γi,j (s , s).

computed as

αi,j−1 (s )γi,j (s , s)βi,j (s).

To estimate the pixel located at (i, j + K 1 ), we marginalize

vector ui,j as

For the non-iterative detection scheme, there is no a-priori

likely when computing P (u i,j ) in equation (14). Since the ﬁrst

distributed, we compute it as,

Practical channels usually have small ISI span. For purposes
of computational illustration, we choose a simple 2-D symmetric mask h = [0 α 0; β 1 β; 0 α 0] of size 3 × 3 as shown
in Figures 2 and 3.
A trellis based on the 3 × 3 mask h has 5 state pixels (i.e.
s0 through s 4 and 3 input pixels as shown in Figure 3) . The 3
input pixels lead to 8 branches coming into/going out from one
state. There are 4 feedback pixels (ω 0 , ω1 , ω2 , ω3 ) which are

optionally used to compute the state transition probability. The
a-priori information for both the input pixels and the feedback
pixels come from the previous detector iteration cycle. With
no feedback, they can be assumed to be zero a-priori. With
feedback, extrinsic information from the previous detector will
be scaled and set as feedback. We will discuss this in more
detail in section II-B.
The branch metrics are the squared Euclidean distances
(SEDs) between the branch output vectors and the received

We deﬁne the non-iterative algorithm with three central

B, in the computation of P (y i,j | Sj = s, Sj−1 = s ), we
use the vector y i,j = [yi−1,j−1 , yi,j , yi+1,j−1 ] as opposed to
yi,j = [yi,j ] for algorithm A.
Following the above example, over a (2K 1 + 1) × (2K2 +

We deﬁne the iterative 2-D algorithm using the a-priori

We deﬁne a simpliﬁed 2-D detection scheme that we term
‘algorithm E’ as follows. We deﬁne a reduced state comprising
of two adjacent pixels s 0 and s1 in the row direction as shown
in Figure 2. An input pixel which is a branch connecting
two neighboring states determines the next state. Two extra
feedback pixels (ω 0 , ω1 ) are added as shown in Figure 2
to account for the local 2-D ISI shape. The state transition
probability is computed using equation (19). The a-priori

in an iterative fashion.

The 2-D iterative scheme takes advantage of different error

using the a-priori information (i.e. the probabilities of all
the feedback pixels as per equation (19) and P (ui,j ) as
per equation (14)). The analysis for dependent statistics is
generally difﬁcult and is a future research topic.

single-row/column iterative detector. As shown in Figure 5,
algorithm E at BER 10 −6 is within 0.5 dB of the algorithms
C and D. At BER 10−6 , the iterative algorithms have 2 dB
SNR gain over the non-iterative ones.
Algorithm E with 10 iterations is 0.3% as complex as algorithm D with 5 iterations (complexity computations avoided

Realizing 2-D MAP detection is practically impossible. We
presented several MAP based signal detection algorithms for
2-D ISI channels. Turbo feedback based multi-track MAP

also presented and evaluated several techniques that tradeoff
performance for complexity.

tion (LLRs) between each other via LLR scaling δ as shown
in Figure 4. The scaling process avoids quick convergence and
error propagation during successive iterations.
The log-likelihood ratio L(i, j) during a current iteration
depends on the a-priori information L in (i, j) to the current
e
(row or column) detector and its own extrinsic information.
Extrinsic information L out (i, j) is passed to the next detector
as a-priori information according to
Lout (i, j) = L(i, j) − Lin (i, j).

III. S IMULATION R ESULTS
We present Monte Carlo simulation results of the 2-D
detection algorithms and compare their performance. All simulations employ a random 64×64 binary image with a boundary
corresponding to the mask size so that the trellis could start
and end with an all zero state. The SNR is deﬁned as in [12]:

where σω is the variance of the Gaussian r.v.s ω(m, n) in (2).
We assume α = β = 0.25 in the 3 × 3 mask h, for simulation
purposes.
Iterative algorithms C and D employ a 5-iteration scheme
with scale factor δ = 0.8. Algorithm E uses a 10-iteration
scheme with weight δ = 0.5. The performance of the algorithms converge, i.e. no more signiﬁcant SNR gain, after these
numbers of iterations mentioned here.
Algorithm B performs much better than algorithm A, since
the state transition probability is computed more accurately
(i.e. more contributing terms dealing with ISI rather than in
the single case).
Algorithms C and D spanning multi-rows/columns perform
better than algorithm E with simpliﬁed trellis because handling
