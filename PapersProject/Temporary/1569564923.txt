Abstract—The universal strongly secure network coding
scheme allows communication at maximum rate while ensuring
that, independently from the underlying network code, no part
of the secret message is revealed to the wiretapper. Although
Silva and Kschischang showed the existence of such a scheme,
the explicit construction remained an open question. This paper
demonstrates an explicit construction of the scheme that uses
secret sharing schemes based on maximum rank distance (MRD)
codes, which can be viewed as a special case of Ozarow-Wyner
coset coding scheme.

I. Introduction
Secure network coding was ﬁrst introduced by Cai et al. [6],
and further investigated by Feldman et al. [10]. In the scenario
of secure network coding, a source node transmits n packets to
sink nodes through a network that implements network coding
[1], [13], [14] without error, and the wiretapper observes µ(<
n) links in the network. The problem is how to encode a secret
message into the n transmitted packets in such a way that the
wiretapper obtain no information about the message, in the
sense of information theoretic security.
As shown in [9], secure network coding can be seen as a
generalization of the wiretap channel II [19] for network coding. Hence in secure network coding, the secrecy is realized
by introducing the randomness into n transmitted packets [6],
[9], [10], [22]. Let the secret message be represented by l
packets S 1 , . . . , S l (1 ≤ l ≤ n). Then, n transmitted packets
are generated from (S 1 , . . . , S l ) and n − l random packets that
are independent from the message, and no information about
(S 1 , . . . , S l ) leaks to the wiretapper observing at most µ = n−l
links.
A drawback of enforcing security is that the communication
rate must be reduced from n to l = n − µ due to the random
packets. Hoping to overcome this problem, Bhattad et al. [2]
proposed the weakly secure network coding. Their scheme
guarantees that the mutual information between any one element of (S 1 , . . . , S l ) and data obtained from at most µ = n − 1
wiretapped links in the network is always zero. The idea of
weakly secure network coding is that S 1 , . . . , S i−1 , S i+1 , . . . , S l
served as the extra random packets masking si ambiguous
to the wiretapper, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ l. Hence, when l = n,
i.e., without random packets, the maximum communication
rate n can be achieved with ensuring that each S i is masked

1

with S 1 , . . . , S i−1 , S i+1 , . . . , S l and S i is not revealed to the
wiretapper. Harada et al. [12] deﬁned the stronger security
requirement (called the strong security) on the weakly secure
network coding than Bhattad et al.’s one. They deﬁned the
strong security as the one that requires the mutual information between any r elements of (S 1 , . . . , S l ) and information
symbols obtained from any µ = n − r wiretapped links
in the network being always zero. They proposed a coding
scheme attaining the strong security. However, both schemes
[2] and [12] depend on the network topology and coding
at intermediate nodes, and the computational complexity of
code construction is large. Cai [4] proved that random linear
network coding over suﬃciently large ﬁelds attains the strong
security with arbitrarily high probability, but it is impractical
due to network coding over huge ﬁelds and inapplicable to
non-random one.
In order to solve these problems, Silva et al. [21] proposed
a coding scheme that attains the strong security [12] independently from network code construction. Their scheme can
be applied to underlying any (even random) linear network
codes. Hence it is called universal. As [22], their scheme uses
Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19] based on maximum
rank distance (MRD) codes [11]. They showed only the
existence of their scheme for l > 2, and gave an explicit
construction only for l = 1, 2. As mentioned in [21, Section
V], the explicit construction of such an eﬃcient scheme for
arbitrary l still remains an open question. On the other hand,
Matsumoto et al. [17] proposed another universal scheme
that attains the strong security. However, to attain the strong
security, the network must transport packets of large size. Their
scheme is less eﬃcient than Silva et al.’s one with respect to
required packet size.
This paper gives an explicit construction of universal
strongly secure scheme using MRD codes, and solves the open
question about an explicit construction of universal strongly
secure scheme in [21]. Unlike [21], [22], our scheme uses
secret sharing schemes [3], [20] based on MRD codes. Our
scheme can be viewed as a special case of Ozarow-Wyner
coset coding scheme [19] and that of nested coset coding
schemes [23]. Also, our scheme can be viewed as a generalization of Nishiara et al.’s secret sharing scheme [18] using
Reed-Solomon codes, to network coding. Our assumption is

only that, as well as [21], [22], the network must transport
packets of size m ≥ l + n symbols. In addition to packet size,
an advantage over [17] is that our scheme always attains the
strong security with probability one, whereas Matsumoto et
al.’s scheme [17] can constructs a code attaining the strong
security with probability arbitrarily close to one. Furthermore,
we completely solved the open problem posed at the end of
Section V-B of Cai et al.’s survey paper [5] on secure network
coding.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents a brief review of rank distance and linear network
coding. Section III deﬁnes the universal strong security. Section IV introduces our scheme and proves that our scheme
attains the universal strong security.
II. Preliminary
A. Basic notations
Let H(X) be the Shannon entropy of a random variable X,
H(X|Y) be the conditional entropy of X given Y, and I(X; Y)
be the mutual information between X and Y [8]. We denote
by |X| the cardinality of a set X.
Let Fq stand for the ﬁnite ﬁeld containing q elements, and
Fqm be an m-degree ﬁeld extension of the base ﬁeld Fq . An
n-dimensional row vector space over Fqm is denoted by Fnm =
q
F1×n , and also Fn = F1×n . We denote by dimFqm V the dimension
q
q
qm
of a subspace V over Fqm , and by rankFqm M the rank of a matrix
M over Fqm . Also, dimFq V is the dimension of V over Fq , and
rankFq M is the rank of M over Fq .
An [n, k] linear code C over Fqm is a k-dimensional subspace
of Fnm , and the minimum Hamming distance of C is represented
q
by d(C). A subspace of a code is called a subcode [15].
B. Rank distance
Recall that Fqm can be viewed as a vector space over Fq .
That is, when the basis of the space is ﬁxed, an element of Fqm
can be regarded as an m-dimensional (column) vector over Fq .
Let φm : Fqm → Fm×1 be a vector space isomorphism
q
that expands an element of Fqm as a column vector over Fq
according to some ﬁxed basis for Fqm over Fq . For a vector x =
N
N
φm (x1 ), . . . , φm (xN ) ∈
[x1 , . . . , xN ] ∈ Fqm , we write φm (x)
N
N
m×N
Fq . The rank distance [11] between x ∈ Fqm and y ∈ Fqm
N
is deﬁned as dR (x, y) rankFq φm (y − x) . Note that the rank
distance is a metric as well as the Hamming distance.
N
The minimum rank distance of a linear block code C ⊂ Fqm ,
denoted dR (C), is deﬁned by
dR (C)

min{dR (x, y) : x, y ∈ C, x

y}.

There exists a Singleton-type bound for the rank metric [11],
and codes achieving this bound are called maximum rank
distance (MRD) codes. As shown in [11], MRD codes exist
for all choices of parameters q, m, N and d ≤ min{N, m}.
N
For a linear code C ⊂ Fqm , the Singleton-type bound is
m
dR (C) ≤ min{1, N }(N − dimFqm C) + 1. Note that every MRD
code with m ≥ N is also a maximum distance separable (MDS)
code, i.e., d(C) = dR (C) = N − dimFqm C + 1.

C. Linear network coding
As in [2], [6], [12], [21], [22], we consider a multicast
communication network represented by a directed multigraph
with unit capacity links, a single source node, and multiple
sink nodes. In this paper, we call elements of a column vector
m×1
space Fq as packets. Assume that each link in the network
can carry an element of Fq per one time slot, and that each
link transports single packet over m time slots without delays,
erasures, or errors.
We assume that Fq -linear network coding [14] is employed
over the network. In the network, the source node produces n
packets X1 , . . . , Xn ∈ Fm×1 . Then, the source node transmits
q
m × n matrix X = [X1 , . . . , Xn ] ∈ Fm×n from n outgoing
q
links to sink nodes through the network, where each outgoing
link transports each column of X. The packet transmitted on
any link in the network can be represented as an Fq -linear
combination of packets X1 , . . . , Xn . Namely, the information
transmitted on a link e in the network can be denoted as
be X T ∈ F1×m , where the coeﬃcient vector be ∈ Fn is called
q
q
global coding vector (GCV) of e. Constructing a network code
is equivalent to determining the GCV of each link by setting
the coeﬃcients of the linear combination performed at each
node.
The network code is called feasible if each sink node can
recover X. We will say that the network is an (n, m, Fq )linear network [21] if it uses an Fq -linear network code that is
feasible for the transmission of n packets of length m. Clearly,
this achieves if and only if a matrix consisting of GCV’s of
incoming links to each sink node has rank n.
III. Universal strong security for wiretap networks
This section presents the wiretap network model [6], [22]
which introduces a wiretapper in the setup of Section II-C.
From now on, only one sink node is assumed without loss of
generality.
First ﬁx l with 1 ≤ l ≤ n, as the number of packets containing a secret message. Let S = [S 1 , . . . , S l ], S i ∈ Fm×1 , be
q
the secret message, and assume that S 1 , . . . , S l are uniformly
distributed over Fm×1 and mutually independent. The source
q
node wishes to transmit S to the sink node in such a way that
the secret message S does not leak to the wiretapper. At the
source node, S is ﬁrst encoded to n packets X1 , . . . , Xn ∈ Fm×1 ,
q
and then X = [X1 , . . . , Xn ] ∈ Fm×n is transmitted through the
q
network as described in Section II-C.
The sink node receives n packets Y ∈ Fm×n as Y T = AX T ∈
q
n×m
Fq , where A ∈ Fn×n is the matrix constructed by appending
q
the GCV’s of the incoming links to the sink node.
Let W be the set of |W| = µ links in the network,
intercepted by the wiretapper. Then the packets W ∈ Fm×µ
q
observed by the wiretapper are given by W T = BX T , where
B ∈ Fµ×n is the matrix whose rows are the GCV’s associated
q
with the links in W. We allow W to be any set of µ links in
the network.
Then the deﬁnition of the strong security for secure communication over the network is given as follows.

Deﬁnition 1 (Strong security [12]). Let S Z = (S i : i ∈ Z) be
a tuple indexed by a subset Z ⊂ {1, . . . , l}. Then,
H(S |Y) = 0,
I(S Z ; W) = 0,

(1)
∀Z, ∀W s.t. |Z| + |W| ≤ n.

(2)

Note that Eq.(1) is satisﬁed if S is uniquely decodable
from X and the network code used is feasible. Harada et al.
[12] proposed a coding scheme that satisﬁes Deﬁnition 1 with
m = 1 and large q. Silva et al. [21] extended Deﬁnition 1 by
separating the generation of X from underlying network codes,
as follows.
Deﬁnition 2 (Universal strong security [21]). Let S Z = (S i :
i ∈ Z) be a tuple indexed by a subset Z ⊂ {1, . . . , l}. Then,
H(S |Y) = 0,
T

I(S Z ; BX ) = 0,

(3)
∀Z, ∀B ∈

Fµ×n
q

s.t. µ ≤ n − |Z|.

(4)

Remark 3. In [21], Silva et al. deﬁned the universal weak
security against guessing by Eq.(3) and
I(S i ; BX T |S Z\{i} ) = 0,
∀Z, ∀i ∈ Z, ∀B ∈ Fµ×n s.t. µ ≤ n − |Z|.
q

(5)

Equation (5) is equivalent to Eq.(4) [21, Proposition 5], and
hence Deﬁnition 2 is equivalent to the universal weak security
against guessing.
A coding scheme that satisﬁes the universal strong security
in Deﬁnition 2 can be designed independently and applied to
any (even random) network code. Silva et al. [21] demonstrated an explicit construction that satisﬁes the universal
strong security only for l = 1, 2. Their scheme is based on
Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19] with a parity check
matrix of an [n, n − l] MRD code over Fqm , provided m ≥ n.
IV. The universal strongly secure scheme
A. Description of the proposed scheme
In an (n, m, Fq )-linear network, suppose that a column vector
space Fm×1 is regarded as a ﬁeld extension Fqm of Fq , as [21],
q
[22]. Also assume that the degree m of the ﬁeld extension
Fqm satisﬁes m ≥ l + n. Then, our scheme generates a vector
X ∈ Fnm as n packets transmitted through the (n, m, Fq )-linear
q
network, as follows.
Let D1 be an [l+n, n] MRD code over Fqm with a systematic
n×(l+n)
generator matrix G1 = I P ∈ Fqm
, where I is the n ×
n identity matrix. Let D2 ⊂ D1 be an (n − l)-dimensional
subcode over Fqm with a generator matrix G2 that consists of
the lower (n − l) rows of G1 , i.e., G1 = ∆G . We note that a
G2
systematic generator matrix G1 can be always chosen without
loss of generality, since MRD codes are linear codes. Then,
as illustrated in Fig.1, the source node ﬁrst executes encoding
of D1 ,
C = [C1 , . . . , Cl+n ] = [S , X] = [S , R]G1 = S ∆G + RG2 ,
([C1 , . . . , Cl+n ] = [S , X] = S G1 when l = n),

and obtain X = [Cl+1 , . . . , Cl+n ] ∈ Fnm by puncturing the
q
codeword [C1 , . . . , Cl+n ] = [S , X] ∈ D1 , where R ∈ Fn−l is a
qm
random vector chosen uniformly at random and independently
from S . On the other hand, a sink node receives packets
Y T = AX T as described in Section III, and recover S by
computing X T = A−1 Y T and executing the erasure decoding
operation of the MRD code D1 on X.
Our coding scheme presented above is called the secret
sharing scheme based on linear codes [7], [16], where secret
sharing [3], [20] is a process of encoding a secret S into a set
of n pieces of information segments (called shares). Namely,
each component Ci ∈ Fqm of X = [Cl+1 , . . . , Cl+n ] in our
coding scheme can be regarded as a share generated from S in
the secret sharing scheme based on a systematic MRD code.
Consider the case where D1 is not an MRD code but a ReedSolomon code in the above settings. Then this secret sharing
scheme becomes Nishiara et al.’s one [18]. Similarly to the
relation between the wiretap channel II and secure network
coding, our scheme can be viewed as a generalization of their
scheme [18] for network coding.
For a subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , N} and a vector c = [c1 , . . . , cN ] ∈
N
Fqm , let PJ (c) be a vector of length |J| over Fqm , obtained by
removing the t-th components ct for t J. For example for
J = {1, 3} and c = [1, 1, 0, 1] (N = 4), we have PJ (c) = [1, 0].
N
The punctured code PJ (C) of a code C ∈ Fqn is given by
PJ (C)

PJ (c) : c ∈ C .

We deﬁne punctured codes C1 PX (D1 ) and C2 PX (D2 ) to
the index set X {l + 1, . . . , l + n} in our coding scheme. Note
that we have C1 ⊃ C2 , and let C1 /C2 denote the quotient space.
Then, the generation of X stated above can be redescribed
by using C1 , C2 as follows. The message S is mapped to the
coset ψ(S )
PX (S ∆G) + C2 ∈ C1 /C2 by the mapping ψ :
Flqm → C1 /C2 determined by ∆G. The vector X ∈ Fnm is chosen
q
uniformly at random from ψ(S ). This implies that our secret
sharing scheme can be viewed as a case of nested coset coding
schemes [23] with C1 , C2 , which is a generalization of OzarowWyner coset coding scheme [19]. We shall explain that our
scheme is, moreover, a special case of Ozarow-Wyner coset
coding scheme in Section IV-C1.
B. Security of our scheme
This section demonstrates that our scheme achieves the
universal strong security deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.
For a subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , N}, the shortened code CJ of a
N
code C ⊂ Fqm is deﬁned by
CJ

PJ (c) : c = [c1 , . . . , cN ] ∈ C, ci = 0 for i

J .

For example for C = {[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]} (N =
3) and J = {2, 3}, we have CJ = {[0, 0], [1, 1]}.
Now we introduce the following theorem showing the
security of the proposed scheme given in Section IV-A.
Theorem 4. For an arbitrary index i ∈ {1, . . . , l}, let
{i} = {1, . . . , l + n}\{i}. And let Z{i} = P{i} (C) =

[S 1 , . . . , S i−1 , S i+1 , . . . , S l , X] be a vector of length l + n − 1
over Fqm , given by puncturing C to {i}. Then, we have
ω×(l+n−1)
∀i, ∀D ∈ Fq
s.t. ω ≤ n − 1.

Proof: First, by the chain rule [8], we have the following
equation for the mutual information between S i and DZ T .

T
= H(S i ) − H(S i |DZ{i} )

= 1 − H(Z{i} |DZ{i} ) − H(S i |Z{i} , DZ{i} ) + H(Z{i} |DZ{i} , S i )

(6)

In the following, we shall prove that H(Z{i} |DZ T ) = n −
{i}
rankFqm D and H(Z{i} |DZ T , S i ) = n − 1 − rankFqm D in Eq.(6).
{i}
l+n−1
Deﬁne a punctured code G1,i = P{i} (D1 ) ⊂ Fqm
and a
l+n−1
shortened code G2,i = (D1 ){i} ⊂ Fqm over Fqm . Since an MRD
code D1 is also MDS, an n × n matrix over Fqm consisting
of arbitrary n columns of the generator matrix G1 of D1 is
always nonsingular. Thus, the dimension of a punctured code
G1,i of D1 to {i} is dimFqm G1,i = dimFqm D1 . Moreover, since
G1 is systematic, we can see that G2,i is a subcode of G1,i
with dimFqm G2,i = dimFqm G1,i − 1 = dimFqm D1 − 1 for each i ∈
{1, . . . , l}. Since G2,i is a shortened code of D1 and shortened
codes can be regarded as subcodes, we have
(7)

On the other hand, since G2,i is a linear code of length n + l − 1
with dimFqm G2,i = n − 1 over Fqm , the Singleton-type bound for
the rank metric [11] gives
dR (G2,i ) ≤ (n + l − 1) − (n − 1) + 1 = l + 1.

is a systematic generator matrix of D1 .

can be viewed as a vector chosen uniformly at random from
the coset P{i} (S i T i ) + G2,i ∈ G1,i /G2,i for each i ∈ {1, . . . , l}.
This implies that Z{i} can be viewed as a vector generated by
a nested coset coding scheme with G1,i , G2,i . From [23, Proof
of Lemma 4.2], we thus have
T
H(Z{i} |S i , DZ{i} ) = (n + l − 1) − rankFqm

H2,i
,
D

(9)

(10)

Recall that the number ω of rows of D is ω ≤ n − 1, and that
H2,i is a parity check matrix of an [l + n − 1, n − 1] MRD code
G2,i . Hence, from [22, Theorem 5], we have

T
T
= 1 − H(S i , Z{i} |DZ{i} ) + H(Z{i} |DZ{i} , S i )

dR (G2,i ) ≥ dR (D1 ) = l + 1.

(8)

We thus have dR (G2,i ) = l + 1 from Eqs.(7) and (8), and hence
G2,i is an MRD code of length l + n − 1 over Fqm .
l×(l+n−1)
Deﬁne a parity check matrix H2,i ∈ Fqm
of G2,i and a
(l−1)×(l+n−1)
parity check matrix H1,i ∈ Fqm
of G1,i such that H1,i
consists of ﬁrst l − 1 rows of H2,i , i.e., H2,i = H1,i . Let the
∆H
l×(l+n)
i-th row of ∆G ∈ Fqm
be denoted by T i ∈ Fl+n . Recall that
qm
X is generated by
[S 1 , . . . , S l , X] = [S 1 , . . . , S l , R]G1 ,
and that S 1 , . . . , S l have been assumed to be mutually indel+n−1
pendent and uniformly distributed over Fqm . Thus, Z{i} ∈ Fqm

4

rankFqm

H2,i
= rankFqm H2,i + rankFqm D
D
= l + rankFqm D.

(11)

Also, since H1,i is a submatrix of H2,i , we have
rankFqm

H1,i
= rankFqm H1,i + rankFqm D
D
= l − 1 + rankFqm D.

(12)

Thus, by substituting Eqs.(11), (12) into Eqs.(9), (10), we
ﬁnally have
T
H(Z{i} |DZ{i} , S i ) = n − 1 − rankFqm D,
T
H(Z{i} |DZ{i} ) = n − rankFqm D.

Therefore, from Eq.(6), I(S i ; DZ T ) = 0 is established.
{i}
This theorem clariﬁes that, in our scheme, any one element
of S 1 , . . . , S l does not leak out even if the wiretapper observes
any n−1 symbols of Fq -linear combination obtained from other
l − 1 secret elements and n elements of X.
Finally, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 5. The scheme given in Section IV-A attains the
universal strong security given by Deﬁnition 2.
Proof: First, H(S |Y) = 0 in Eq.(3) is obvious, because
the underlying network coding is feasible and the MRD code
D1 is also an MDS code with d(D1 ) = l + 1.
Next consider Eq.(4). Let B ∈ Fµ×n (1 ≤ µ ≤ n − 1) be an
q
arbitrary matrix over the base ﬁeld Fq . Let Z ⊂ {1, . . . , l} be
an arbitrary index set with |Z| ≤ n − µ. For each i ∈ Z, deﬁne
(|Z|−1)×(l−1)
a matrix Ei ∈ Fq
that consists of |Z| − 1 rows of an
(l − 1) × (l − 1) identity matrix, satisfying
[S j : j ∈ Z\{i}]T = Ei [S 1 , . . . , S i−1 , S i+1 , . . . , S l ]T .

(|Z|+µ−1)×(l+n−1)
Also deﬁne a matrix Di = Ei O ∈ Fq
, and let
O B
Z{i} = [S 1 , . . . , S i−1 , S i+1 , . . . , S l , X]. Then, since |Z| + µ − 1 ≤
n − 1, we have
T
I(S i ; BX T , S Z\{i} ) = I(S i ; Di Z{i} ) = 0,

∀i ∈ Z,

from Theorem 4. On the other hand, since S 1 , . . . , S l are
mutually independent, we have
0 = I(S i ; BX T , S Z\{i} ) = H(S i ) − H(S i |BX T , S Z\{i} ))
= H(S i |S Z\{i} ) − H(S i |BX T , S Z\{i} )
= I(S i ; BX T |S Z\{i} ),
holds for all i ∈ Z. Hence, we have I(S Z ; BX T ) = 0 from
Remark 3.
C. Discussion
1) Relation to Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19]:
We ﬁrst give the following proposition.
Proposition 6. Let C1 , C2 be as deﬁned at the end of Section IV-A. Then, C1 = Fnm and C2 is an [n, n − l] MRD code
q
over Fqm .
Proof: Recall that in Section IV-A, we deﬁned D1 as
an [l + n, n] MRD code with a systematic generator matrix
G1 , and D2 ⊂ D1 as an (n − l)-dimensional subcode with
a generator matrix G2 consisting of the lower (n − l) rows
of G1 . Then, C1 and C2 were deﬁned as C1 = PX (D1 ) and
C2 = PX (D2 ), respectively. Since an MRD code is also MDS,
an n × n matrix over Fqm consisting of last n columns of G1 is
nonsingular. Thus, we have C1 = PX (D1 ) = Fnm . On the other
q
hand, since ﬁrst l components of every codeword in D2 are
always zero, we have dimFqm C2 = dimFqm D2 = n − l. We thus
have dR (C2 ) ≤ l+1 from the Singleton-type bound for the rank
metric [11]. We also have dR (C2 ) = dR (D2 ) ≥ dR (D1 ) = l + 1
from D2 ⊂ D1 . Thus, dR (C2 ) = l + 1, and C2 is MRD.
This implies that our scheme is a special case of the
Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19] with an [n, n − l]
MRD code C2 , as with Silva et al.’s scheme [21], [22].
2) Diﬀerence to Silva et al.’s scheme [21]: As stated in
Section IV-C1, both our scheme and Silva et al.’s one [21] are
based on the Ozarow-Wyner coset coding scheme [19] with an
[n, n−l] MRD code. However, while Silva et al.’s scheme does
not specify the mapping from the message to the coset, our
scheme determines the mapping ψ by the systematic generator
matrix G1 of D1 , i.e., ∆G. We shall explain the necessity of
this diﬀerence for ensuring our scheme to satisfy Deﬁnition 2.
In the proof of Theorem 4, from the condition that G1 is
systematic, it was shown that the shortened code G2,i of D1
to {i} is an [l + n − 1, n − 1] MRD code over Fqm for each i ∈
{1, . . . , l}. Since G2,i is MRD, Eq.(11) holds from [22, Theorem
5], and Theorem 4 is established. In short, we need G1 being
systematic to show that our scheme satisﬁes Deﬁnition 2.
3) The required packet length: In [21, Theorem 8], Silva
et al. showed only the existence of their scheme satisfying
Deﬁnition 2 if the packet length m ≥ (l + n)2 /8 + logq 16l.
In contrast, we have demonstrated an explicit construction

5

that satisﬁes Deﬁnition 2 whenever m ≥ l + n. Furthermore,
we always have l + n < (l + n)2 /8 + logq 16l for l ≥ 1 and
n ≥ 2. Therefore, our condition for the packet length is less
demanding than that of Silva et al.’s.
