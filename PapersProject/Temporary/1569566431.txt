information digits). The control digit involving in both errors
were taken into account in [11] eventually. A comprehensive
investigation on a check digit system over a quasigroup
was conducted in [12], [13], where necessary and sufﬁcient
conditions were established in order to detect each of the ﬁve
error types. So far, the approaches have been taken are in
general analytical.
In [1], M. Niemenmaa proposed a check digit system for
hexadecimal numbers, based on a suitable automorphism of
the elementary abelian group of order 16. Its design is concise
and elegant, with the capacity of detecting all the ﬁve types
of errors listed above. Two use cases of hexadecimal numbers
in real life applications are worth mentioning. They are the
International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) which
enables the identiﬁcation of any kind of audiovisual works and
the International Mobile Equipment Identiﬁer (MEID) which
is unique for each mobile station.

Abstract—In this paper, we consider check digit systems which
are based on the use of elementary abelian p-groups of order pk .
The work is inspired by a recently introduced check digit system
for hexadecimal numbers. By interpreting its check equation in
terminology of matrix algebra, we generalize the idea to build
systems over a group of order pk , while keeping the ability to
detect all the 1) single errors, 2) adjacent transpositions, 3) twin
errors, 4) jump transpositions and 5) jump twin errors.
Besides, we consider two categories of jump errors: t-jump
transpositions and t-jump twin errors, which include and further
extend the double error types of 2)-5). In particular, we explore
the capacity range of the system to detect these two kinds of
generalized jump errors, and demonstrate that it is 2k − 3 for
p = 2 and (pk − 1)/2 − 2 for an odd prime p. Also, we show how
to build such a system that detects all the single errors and these
two kinds of double jump-errors within the capacity range.

I. I NTRODUCTION
According to the empirical investigations by D. F. Beckley
[2] and J. Verhoeff [3], when transmitting a sequence of
digits, the most common transmission errors made by human
operators are the following:
1) single error: · · · a · · · → · · · b · · · ;
2) adjacent transposition: · · · ab · · · → · · · ba · · · ;
3) twin error: · · · aa · · · → · · · bb · · · ;
4) jump transposition: · · · abc · · · → · · · cba · · · ;
5) jump twin error: · · · aca · · · → · · · bcb · · · .
Among them, single errors and adjacent transpositions, are the
most prevalent ones. The recognition of these errors is usually
done by appending a check digit an+1 to a given sequence
a1 · · · an of information digits.
Some well-known examples of the check digit systems used
in practice are the European Article Number (EAN) Code, the
Universal Product Code (UPC) and the International Standard
Book Number (ISBN) Code.

B. Our approach
In this paper, we ﬁrst brieﬂy review the check digit system proposed in [1]. By interpreting its check equation in
terminology of matrix algebra [18] , we generalize its idea for
hexadecimal numbers to a group of order pk , for k ≥ 1 and
a prime p. To serve the purpose of detecting all the ﬁve types
of errors, we explore the properties of the desirable matrices
which are suitable for the system design, the number of them
and the asymptotic probability of ﬁnding them as well.
Moreover, we deﬁne the following two categories of jump
errors, which include and further extend the error types 2)-5).
6) t-jump transposition:
· · · ab1 · · · bt c · · · → · · · cb1 · · · bt a · · ·
7) t-jump twin error:
· · · ab1 · · · bt a · · · → · · · cb1 · · · bt c · · ·

A. Previous studies

Let t ≥ 0, and as t = 0 we have b1 · · · bt ∈ ∅. It is easy to
see that, the error types 2) and 4): adjacent transposition and
jump transposition, can be regarded as t-jump transpositions
for t = 0 and t = 1, respectively; 3) and 5): twin error and
jump twin error, can be regarded as t-jump twin errors for
t = 0 and t = 1, respectively.
These two kinds of errors were ﬁrst taken into consideration
in [14]. They are of our interest, not only because they simplify
the list of the error types, but also because they may occur
more frequently than expected, especially when people input
data while using a new keyboard with an unexpected layout,

Since single errors and the adjacent transpositions are the
most prevalent ones, it is not surprising that research attention
was ﬁrst given to design systems over groups with antisymmetric mappings which ensure these two kinds of errors
to be detected. One can refer to a long list of research articles
such as [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and a survey of anti-symmetric
mappings in different groups in [10].
Thereafter, possibility of constructing error detecting codes
based on quasigroups was discussed in [6]. Necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions were established in order to detect adjacent transpositions and jump transpositions (but only in the

1

or when they forget to switch the language to the right one
they intend to use.
We deﬁne tc , the largest jump length such that for any t ≤
tc , all the t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors will
be detected, to be the capacity of the system to detect these
two kinds of generalized jump errors. A check digit system
capable of detecting all the single errors, and double errors
of maximum jump length, is desirable due to its improved
performance on the error detection capability.
Consider our proposed systems over a group of order pk . For
p = 2, we are able to construct systems that reach the capacity
of the jump-error detection: 2k − 3. To do that, we employ
matrices of a special kind, those with primitive polynomials as
their characteristic polynomials. Applying the similar approach
to the systems for an odd p, we show that the maximum jumplength that can be covered in the range of error detection is
(pk − 1)/2 − 2.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: First in Section
II, we brieﬂy review the recently introduced check digit system
for hexadecimal numbers. Its generalization to a group of order
pk is presented in Section III. In Section IV, we discuss on the
capability of the jump-error detection of the proposed systems.
We give some proofs in Section V and ﬁnally conclude in
Section VI.

We slightly abuse the notion P by letting

Then equation (4) has the following matrix interpretation:

As a direct result, the check equation (1) can be rewritten as
a1 · P + a2 · P2 + · · · + an · Pn + an+1 · Pn+1 = 0.

III. C HECK DIGIT SYSTEM OVER A GROUP OF ORDER pk
In last section, the check digit system is designed only for
hexadecimal numbers. Inspired by it but working with a check
equation in terms of matrix equation, we provide a general
design of check digit systems which are based on the use
of elementary abelian p-groups of order pk . The proposed
systems keep the ability to detect all the ﬁve error types 1)-5).
Consider a check digit system for pk numbers:
0, 1, 2, · · · , pk − 1, where p is a prime and k > 0. Similarly to
the approach in Section II-A, we represent these pk numbers
as elements of the abelian group G = Z1 ⊕ Z2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Zk ,
p
p
p
where Zi = Zp for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Each number corresponds to a
p
k-tuple in G. We take the k-tuple as the base p representation
of the number for simplicity.
Denote the information digits to be a1 , · · · , an and the
check digit to be an+1 , all as elements of the group (G, +).
We use the check equation (5):

II. C HECK DIGIT SYSTEM FOR HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS
In this section, we brieﬂy review the check digit system for
hexadecimal numbers proposed in [1].
A. Group
In [1], the hexadecimal numbers are represented as elements
of the abelian group G = Z2 ⊕ Z2 ⊕ Z2 ⊕ Z2 by denoting
0 = (0, 0, 0, 0), 1 = (0, 0, 0, 1), ..., 9 = (1, 0, 0, 1), A =
(1, 0, 1, 0), B = (1, 0, 1, 1), C = (1, 1, 0, 0), D = (1, 1, 0, 1),
E = (1, 1, 1, 0), and F = (1, 1, 1, 1). It is easy to see that in
G, 0 is the identity element and the inverse of each element
is the element itself.

Here P is a matrix over Zp .
It is easy to see that if P is nonsingular, then all single
errors will be detected since

B. Check equation

Additionally, in order to detect all adjacent transpositions,
P has to satisfy the condition

a1 · P + a2 · P2 + · · · + an · Pn + an+1 · Pn+1 = 0.

1)

If the information digits a1 , · · · , an and the check digit
an+1 are interpreted as elements of the group (G, +), then
an+1 can be determined by the check equation
P(a1 ) + P2 (a2 ) + · · · + Pn (an ) + Pn+1 (an+1 ) = 0,

2)

a + b · P = b + a · P for all a = b ∈ G.

That is, P − I must be nonsingular as well. Here I is the k × k
identity matrix.
In order to detect all twin errors, we get the condition

(1)

3)

where P is a permutation of the set G.

a + a · P = b + b · P for all a = b ∈ G.

That is, P + I must be nonsingular.
For the jump transpositions, the condition is

C. Check digit system
In [1], P is deﬁned to be a mapping: G → G by
P((a, b, c, d)) = (a + b, c, d, a).

a · P = b · P for all a = b ∈ G.

4)
(2)

a + b · P + c · P2 = c + b · P + a · P2

for all a = c ∈ G.

To satisfy this condition, it requires P2 − I to be nonsingular.
We note that 4) holds once 2) are 3) are satisﬁed.
For the jump twin errors, we have the condition

By using this speciﬁc P, the system can detect all the ﬁve types
of errors listed in the introduction. As noted, as a permutation,
P is 15-cycle and ﬁxes only the element 0. So is P2 as well.

2

a + c · P + a · P2 = b + c · P + b · P2

for all a = b ∈ G.

It requires P2 + I to be nonsingular.
Easily we have the following theorem:
Theorem 3.1: A check digit system for pk numbers, with
the ability to detect all the errors of types 1)-5), can be
designed by using the check equation (5) and choosing a
matrix P over Zp such that P, P − I, P + I and P2 + I are all
nonsingular.

b) a prime p : p ≡ 3 mod 4: If a prime p have p ≡ 3
mod 4, then −1 is a not quadratic residue modulo p. In this
case, z 2 + 1 is an irreducible polynomial over Zp . As a direct
result, P2 + I can not be further factored.
Let υk be the number of k × k matrices over Zp which are
suitable for the digit check system deﬁned in Theorem 3.1.
These matrices are those without factors of z, z − 1, z + 1 or
z 2 + 1 in their characteristic polynomial. We have
Theorem 3.5:

If p = 2, then over Z2 , P + I is the same as P − I; and
P2 +I = (P+I)2 . Straightforwardly, we can simplify Theorem
3.1 into the following theorem for the special case p = 2.
Theorem 3.2: A check digit system for 2k numbers, with
the ability to detect all the errors of types 1)-5), can be
designed by using the check equation (5) and choosing a
binary matrix P such that both P and P + I are nonsingular.
According to Theorem 3.2, binary matrices with no eigenvalues of 0 or 1 are of our interest. As proved in [15], the
number of such k × k matrices P is 2k(k−1)/2 Nk , where
N0 = 1,

IV. C APABILITY ON JUMP - ERROR DETECTION
The check digit systems proposed in Theorem 3.1 are able
to detect all the ﬁve types errors listed in the introduction. In
this section, we explore their error detection ability beyond
that by considering the more generally deﬁned error types 6)
and 7). In particular, we look into the capacity of the system to
detect these two kinds of jump errors, which is illustrate by tc ,
the largest jump length such that for any t ≤ tc , all the t-jump
transpositions and t-jump twin errors will be detected. Check
digit systems which detect all the single errors and double
jump-errors within the capacity range tc are of our interest.

Proof: The proof is given in Section V.
As k increases, the asymptotic probability of such a matrix
is r≥1 (1 − 1/pr )4 by the following theorem.
Theorem 3.4:
lim

Proof: Similar to the proof of Theorem 3.4.

According to Theorem 3.1, in order to design a check digit
system with the ability to detect all the errors of types 1)-5)
by the check equation (5), we need to use a matrix P over Zp
such that P, P − I, P + I and P2 + I are all nonsingular.
a) a prime p : p ≡ 1 mod 4: It is known that for a
prime p, if p ≡ 1 mod 4, then −1 is a quadratic residue
modulo p. In this case, there is an α ∈ Zp such that α2 ≡ −1
mod p. Straightforwardly, P2 + I can be further factored into
(P + αI) · (P − αI). We note that if P2 + I is nonsingular, it
implies that both P + αI and P − αI are nonsingular as well.
According to Theorem 3.1, the matrices over Zp with no
eigenvalues of 0, 1, −1, α, −α are of our interest. Let γk be
the number of invertible k × k matrices over Zp , and let ρk
be the number of k × k matrices over Zp with no eigenvalues
of 0, 1, −1, α, −α. We have

is one of those 5824 suitable ones for k = 4. As k increases,
the asymptotic probability of such a matrix for the given order,
is approaching 0.0833986 as shown in [15].

for all a = c ∈ G.

It requires that P

when P is over Z2 , Pt+1 − I and Pt+1 + I are the same.
In order to achieve the capacity of the system to detect
these two kinds of jump errors of the largest jump range tc ,

(8)

3

it is required that P − I, P2 − I, · · · Ptc +1 − I and P + I, P2 +
I, · · · , Ptc +1 + I are all nonsingular matrices over Zp .
In general, we have the following upper bound for tc .
Lemma 4.1:
tc ≤ pk − 3.

jump-error detection of the system built on P. So far we get
tc ≤ m − 2.
For any m < m, there is no doubt that f (z) z m − 1,
since m < e. Now we suppose that there is an m < m
such that f (z) | z m + 1. Then we have f (z) | z 2m − 1 with
2m < 2m = e, contrary to the fact that e is the smallest
integer such that f (z) | z e − 1 holds. As a conclusion, for
any m < m, we have f (z) z m − 1 and f (z) z m + 1.
Applying Lemma 4.2, we have for all 1 ≤ t < m, Pt − I and
Pt + I are nonsingular.
Therefore, a digit check system built on such P is capable
of detecting all t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors
with jump length < m − 1. This gives us tc = m − 2 for
systems based on P of this special kind.
In general, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.5: For an odd prime p, tc = (pk − 1)/2 − 2.
Proof: The above discussion gives the achievability of the
theorem. The converse part of the theorem is indicated by [18,
Theorem 3.11]. The detailed proof will follow in an extended
version of this paper.
Theorem 4.6: Let P be a matrix whose characteristic polynomial is a primitive polynomial over Zp . Then a check digit
system built on P is able to detect all the single errors and
t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors for all t ≤ tc .

Proof: Consider f (z), the characteristic polynomial of a
nonsingular matrix P with deg f (z) = k. By [18, Lemma 3.1],
there exists a positive integer e ≤ pk −1 such that f (z) | z e −1.
Replacing z by P in f (z) we have f (P) = 0. In addition that
f (z) | z e − 1, we obtain Pe − I = 0, for e ≤ pk − 1. In order
to fullﬁl 6)’, we have that t + 1 (thus tc + 1) must be less than
e. Therefore, we have tc ≤ pk − 3.
Let f (z) be the characteristic polynomial of a nonsingular
matrix P. We have the following lemma.
Lemma 4.2: If f (z) is irreducible, then for any non-zero
polynomial g(z), g(P) is nonsingular if f (z) g(z).
Proof: If f (z), as the characteristic polynomial of P, is
irreducible, then it is also the minimal polynomial of P such
that f (P) = 0, where 0 is the k × k all-zero matrix. If f (z)
g(z), then by Euclid’s algorithm, there are p(z) and q(x) such
that
1 = p(z)f (z) + q(z)g(z).
Replacing z by P and 1 by I, we obtain the following:
I = p(P)f (P) + q(P)g(P) = q(P)g(P),

C. Choices of P
We recall that the companion matrix of a monic polynomial
g(z) = c0 + c1 z + · · · + ck−1 z k−1 + z k of positive degree k
over Zp is deﬁned to be the k × k matrix

which implies g(P ) is nonsingular.
A. p = 2
If f (z), as the characteristic polynomial of P, is a primitive
polynomial over Z2 , then by deﬁnition, the smallest integer e
such that f (z) divides z e −1 is e = 2k −1. For any t < 2k −1,
we have f (z) z t − 1. In addition, by Lemma 4.2, we have
that for all t < 2k − 1, Pt − I is nonsingular. Thus a digit
check system built on such P is capable of detecting t-jump
errors 6) and 7) with jump length < 2k − 2. This gives us
tc ≥ 2k − 3. In addition that tc ≤ pk − 3 by Lemma 4.1, we
conclude with the following theorem.
Theorem 4.3: For p = 2, tc = 2k − 3.
Theorem 4.4: Let P be a matrix whose characteristic polynomial is a primitive polynomial over Z2 . Then a check digit
system built on P is able to detect all the single errors and
t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors for all t ≤ tc .
It is easy to check that the binary matrix P as deﬁned in (3),
and used for the check digit system for hexadecimal numbers
proposed in [1], actually has the primitive polynomial z 4 +
z 3 + 1 as its character polynomial. According to Theorem 4.4,
the system could detect not only the error types 1)-5), but all
the t-jump transpositions and t-jump twin errors for t ≤ 13.

The character polynomial of such a matrix is exactly g(z).
It is known that there are φ(pk −1)/k primitive polynomials
of degree k over Zp , where φ(·) is Euler’s Totient function. So
given any of the primitive polynomials, an easy construction
of matrix P suitable for Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.6, is to
take the companion matrices of them.
Regarding the number of matrices which has primitive
polynomials as its characteristic polynomials, one can refer
to [19]. For instance, over Z2 it is in total [19]

If f (z), as the characteristic polynomial of P, is a primitive

such that f (z) z e − 1 is e = pk − 1. Let m = e/2. We can
factor z e − 1 into (z m − 1)(z m + 1). Since f (z) z m − 1, we
have f (z) | z m + 1. If we use tc to describe the range of the

In order to count the number of matrices over Zp which
are suitable for the check digit system proposed in Section
III, we use the method of cycle index for matrices over ﬁnite
ﬁeld which is introduced by Kung [16] and extended by Stong
[17]. First we recall the following lemma.

In our treatment, we interpret the check equation in terms of
matrix equation. In order to detect all the ﬁve error types which
are of most interest in the previous literature, we explore the
suitable matrices with desirable properties. We also determine
the number of such matrices for a given order k, and the
asymptotic probability of ﬁnding them as k tends to ∞.
Furthermore, we consider two categories of jump errors: 6)
t-jump transpositions and 7) t-jump twin errors with t ≥ 0,
which include and further extend the double error types of
2)-5). In particular, we are interested in a check digit system,
which is capable of detecting all the single errors and double
errors of types 6) and 7) with maximum jump length, due
to its improved performance on error detection capability. We
show that for p = 2, the capacity range of the system to detect
these two kinds of generalized jump errors is 2k − 3; and for
an odd prime p, the capacity range is (pk − 1)/2 − 2. Last but
not least, using a special kind of matrices whose characteristic
polynomials are primitive polynomials, we are able to build
the desired check digit system which detects all the errors of
type 1) single errors, and double errors of types 6) and 7)
within the capacity range.

Let Φ to be the full set of monic irreducible polynomials
with coefﬁcient in Zp . We apply Lemma 5.1.
Taking A = Φ\{z} gives us all the invertible matrices over
Zp with µk = γk . So

If p ≡ 1 mod 4, taking A = Φ\{z, z − 1, z + 1, z −
α, z + α} gives us the set of matrices over Zp without any of
0, 1, −1, α, −α as eigenvalues. Thus we have µk = ρk and

In order to obtain the right side of the above equation, we
multiply the right side of (12) by r≥1 (1 − u/pr )4 to take
out the factors corresponding to the polynomials z − 1, z +
1, z − α, z + α. So we have the statement of Theorem 3.3:

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we consider check digit systems which are
based on the use of elementary abelian p-groups of order pk ,
for k ≥ 1 and a prime p. The work is inspired by the check
digit system for hexadecimal numbers proposed in [1] which is
able to detect all the 1) single errors, 2) adjacent transpositions,
3) twin errors, 4) jump transpositions and 5) jump twin errors.
