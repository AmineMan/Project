Abstract—We derive a rate region which is achievable by the
Wiretap MAC with Common Message under the strong secrecy
criterion. We follow Devetak’s approach to establishing strong
secrecy. Using the concentration of the normed sum of bounded
i.i.d. random variables around its mean, it is possible to show the
existence of a code where the channel outputs at the eavesdropper
are almost independent of the messages. The encoders may use
a certain amount of common randomness. We give the example
of a channel where the availability of common randomness is
necessary for secret transmission.

I. I NTRODUCTION

There are many other ways of incorporating secrecy issues
into MAC models. For example, each encoder may obtain
generalized feedback and want to keep the other sender instead
of an eavesdropper uninformed about its message [8][11][12].
The case where the encoders have access to generalized
feedback but do not have to keep their messages secret from
each other, but from an external eavesdropper, is considered
in [16].
In the cognitive MAC, the encoders have a common message and one has a private message. If there is no eavesdropper,
the encoder without a private message obtains a noisy version
of the codeword sent by the other encoder and must be kept
ignorant of the other encoder’s private message [10]. In [14],
the cognitive MAC without feedback was investigated where
the messages must be kept secret from an eavesdropper and
the encoders have unrestricted access to common randomness.
Our paper is organized as follows. Section II contains the
problem and the main result which is proved in Section III.
In the last section, we discuss the result and give an example.
Notation: We set [K] := {1, . . . , K} for positive integers
K. [x]+ := max(x, 0). P(X ) are the probability measures
on the ﬁnite set X , and for measures µ1 , µ2 on X , we deﬁne
the metric µ1 − µ2 := x∈X |µ1 (x) − µ2 (x)|. δ(x, ·) is the
Dirac measure with mass in x. PX is the distribution of the
n
random variable X. For a random pair (U, X), TU,δ denotes
n
the U -typical n-sequences and TX|U,δ (u) the X|U -typical nsequences conditional on u with constant δ, see [5] for details.

This paper studies the discrete memoryless Multiple Access
Channel (MAC) where communication is overheard by a
second receiver named Eve who acts as an eavesdropper.
The encoders Alice1 and Alice2 have a private message each
and a common message all of which need to be kept secret
from Eve, whereas the intended receiver Bob should be able
to decode all messages with arbitrarily small average error,
see Fig. I. We apply the strong secrecy criterion. In order
to satisfy this criterion, the encoders may use some amount
of common randomness measured by its entropy. Conditional
on this randomness, they can additionally apply independent
stochastic encoding. The result of this paper will be the basis
for deriving a strongly secret rate region for the wiretap MAC
with conferencing encoders as in [18]. This is the basic model
for base station cooperation and requires to keep track of the
common randomness used by the encoders.
We use Devetak’s approach [7] to establishing strong secrecy, which was originally used to establish strong secrecy in
the Quantum Wiretap channel with classical inputs. In contrast
to the weak secrecy criterion introduced in the papers of Wyner
[19] and Csisz´ r and K¨ rner [6], only the strong secrecy
a
o
criterion has been given an operational meaning so far. It was
shown in [1] that if the strong secrecy criterion is satisﬁed, then
the average error of the non-legitimate user for any decoding
scheme it might apply tends to one as the codelength tends to
inﬁnity. The strong secrecy criterion was used, among others,
in [2][3][4][13].
We do not obtain a converse, but a single-letter achievable
region. This is in contrast to [9], where a multi-letter achievable region for the wiretap MAC with external eavesdroppers,
without common message nor common randomness is derived
under the weak secrecy criterion. For special “weak” wiretap
MACs, a multi-letter converse is found.

II. S YSTEM M ODEL AND M AIN R ESULT
The encoders have the ﬁnite input alphabets X and Y ,
respectively, Bob’s alphabet is T , and Eve receives outputs
from the alphabet Z . The wiretap channel is memoryless, it is
determined by a stochastic matrix W : X ×Y → P(T ×Z )
whose marginals are denoted by WT and WZ , respectively.

The transmission of words x ∈ X n and y ∈ Y n is governed
by the probabilities

i=1

− [I(Z ∧ V1 |V2 , U ) − I(T ∧ V1 |V2 , U )]+ ,
Encoding may be stochastic. We ﬁx a number HC ≥ 0 and let
the encoders have access to any source of common randomness
with entropy at most HC which can be used in encoding. That
means that if the message sets are [K0 ], [K1 ], [K2 ] for the
common and the private messages, respectively, blocklengthn encoding is given by a stochastic matrix G : [K0 ] × [K1 ] ×
[K2 ] → P(X n × Y n ) which has the form

R1 + R2 ≤ I(T ∧ V1 , V2 |U ) − I(Z ∧ V1 , V2 |U ),
R0 + R1 + R2 ≤ I(T ∧ V1 , V2 ) − I(Z ∧ V1 , V2 ).
We set p ∈ Π0 if U is deterministic and (1)-(4) are satisﬁed.
R(p) is deﬁned analogously in this case except that the
transmission of a common message is impossible.
Theorem 1. For the common randomness entropy limited by
HC ≥ 0, an achievable rate region for the wiretap MAC with
common message is given by

Here J is a ﬁnite set and H(G0 (·|k0 )) ≤ nHC for every k0 .
Decoding is done deterministically in the usual way. A code
with blocklength n and message sets [K0 ], [K1 ], [K2 ] is called
a code (n, K0 , K1 , K2 ).
A rate R is achievable if for every ε > 0 there is for
sufﬁciently large n a code (n, K0 , K1 , K2 ) satisfying
log Kν ≥ n(Rν − ε)

where conv is the convex hull operator.
III. T HE P ROOF
Using [5, Lemma 2.7], one has
I(Z n ∧ M0 , M1 , M2 ) ≤ −η log

(ν = 0, 1, 2),

I(M0 , M1 , M2 ∧ Z n ) ≤ ε,

PZ n |k0 ,k1 ,k2 − θ ≤ 2−nβ

where the Mν are uniformly distributed on [Kν ] (ν = 0, 1, 2),
where φ is the decoder of the code (n, K0 , K1 , K2 ) and where
T n and Z n are the output random variables at Bob and Eve,
respectively, induced by the random message selection, the
stochastic encoding, and transmission over the channel.
Let
U , V1 , V2
be
ﬁnite
alphabets
and
let
U, (V1 , V2 ), (X, Y ), (T, Z) be a Markov chain with U
taking values in U , with V1 , V2 taking values in V1 and V2
and independent conditional on U , with X only depending
on V1 and Y only depending on V2 and with PT Z|XY = W .
We denote the joint distribution of this Markov chain by
p. If HC = 0, we need that U is single-valued, i.e. we
have independent inputs. For HC > 0, the form of the rate
region achievable with input distribution p depends on the
information between the inputs and Eve’s outputs. Due to lack
of space we concentrate here on the most challenging case
that I(Z ∧ U ) < HC ≤ min{I(Z ∧ V1 , U ), I(Z ∧ V2 , U )}.
For HC > 0, let ΠHC be the set of p that additionally satisfy

k0 ,k1 ,k2

Thus for secrecy, it is sufﬁcient to show (5). We concentrate
on proving the achievability of those sets R(p) whose p
does not involve the auxiliary random variables V1 , V2 . These
can be included in the usual way by preﬁxing them to W
independently at the two encoders. Note that no common
randomness is needed to do that. Thus let a p ∈ ΠHC be given
which is the joint probability distribution of random variables
U, (X, Y ), (T, Z). We use a random code construction. Let a

exponentially. If there is a measure θ on Z n satisfying

analogously to PX n |U n with x replaced by y and X replaced

establish (5):

log L0 ≥ n(I(Z ∧ U ) + 4τ ),

log L2 ≥ n(I(Z ∧ Y |U ) + 4τ ).

2 involve modiﬁcations of WZ which are necessary to obtain
useful estimates. They can be undone with small error after
choosing an appropriate realization of the random variables as
the modiﬁcations are restrictions to typicality. Due to lack of
space, we cannot go into the details of the proof of (6)-(8),
but we describe the settings to which Lemma 2 is applied. For
every (k0 , k1 , k2 ), the corresponding random variables exhibit
the same behavior, so we pick one (k0 , k1 , k2 ) and omit these

The ﬁrst term in the above bound comes from the probability
that conditional on any realization of U l0 , Y l0 l2 , the family
{X l0 l1 : l1 ∈ [L1 ]} does not satisfy A1 (l0 , l2 , z) . The
second term is obtained by an application of Lemma 2 to
the L2 normed sums over l1 of random variables found in the
deﬁnition of A2 (l0 , z) where the realizations of the X l0 l1 do
satisfy A1 (l0 , l2 , z) for every realization of U l0 , Y l0 l2 . F2 (u)
again gives a lower bound on their mean. We denote the
intersection of the A2 (l0 , z) by A2 .
Next we consider (6). We also need A2 (z), the intersection
over l0 of the A2 (l0 , z). For every z deﬁne a new probability

with exponentially high probability. Analogous statements are
true for the second family, where the roles of X and Y
are exchanged in (9)-(12). Thus we can conclude that there
is a realization of the two families satisfying all the above
events. We thus obtain for the two concatenated parts ν =

Here we again use the law of total probability. The ﬁrst two
terms in (11) come from the bound on P[A2 (l0 , z)c ]. The
third term results from an application of Lemma 2 to the L0
random variables appearing in the deﬁnition of A0 (z) which
ˆ
are i.i.d. conditional on A2 (z) with respect to Pz . We denote
the intersection of all A0 (z) by A0 .
Lemma 2 also establishes that given l0 , l2 , most of the
X l0 l1 : l1 ∈ [L1 ] are typical conditional on (Y l0 l2 , U l0 ) with
high probability. For every (l0 , l2 ) let the event A∗ (l0 , l2 ) be

all messages from the Alices using the deterministic MAC
encoder given by the realization of the random variables. If

We denote the intersection of all A∗ (l0 , l2 ) by A∗ .
If ε = 2−nβ for sufﬁciently small β > 0 and L0 , L1 , L2
are chosen according to (6)-(8), then the bounds (9)-(12) tend
to zero doubly-exponentially. By symmetry, it is possible to
prove an analogous sequence of statements where the roles of
the X l0 l1 and Y l0 l2 are exchanged. This gives the alternative
bounds (6’)-(8’).
Now we use the indices k0 , k1 , k2 again. Before passing to
a realization of our random variables, we need to consider
the transmission of messages to Bob. By the coding theorem
for the MAC WT with common message and without an
˜ ˜ ˜
eavesdropper [15], all rate triples (R0 , R1 , R2 ) are achievable
˜
that are contained in the set R(p) deﬁned by

R1 ≈ I(T ∧ X|Y, U ) − αI(Z ∧ X|Y, U )
− (1 − α)I(Z ∧ X|U ),
R2 ≈ I(T ∧ Y |X, U ) − αI(Z ∧ Y |U )
− (1 − α)I(Z ∧ Y |Y, U ),
R1 + R2 ≈ I(T ∧ X, Y |U ) − I(Z ∧ X, Y )|U ),
R0 + R1 + R2 ≈ I(T ∧ X, Y ) − I(Z ∧ X, Y ).
We denote the rate region deﬁned by the bounds on the righthand side by Rα (p). It remains to show (5) for the chosen
realization. As the encoders in the two parts of the code are
independent and the channel memoryless, it is sufﬁcient to
prove the secrecy of the ﬁrst part, the proof for the second
being analogous. We omit the family index (also setting
n1 =: n) and introduce the symbols
:= (1/L0 L1 L2 )

and W := WZ for brevity. We have for every (k0 , k1 , k2 )

contained in R(p) for some η > 0.

the vector I

However, a convex combination of the two might be contained

in R(p). Thus we have to include time-sharing in the random
coding structure instead of doing it after derandomization as
usual. We need two families of random variables as above,

αI (1) + (1 − α)I (2) ∈ R(p).
It remains to determine this union and the extremal α (the convexity of the rate region implies that the set of permissible α is
an interval). The Markovity of the sequence U, (X, Y ), (T, Z)
easily implies that the union of the permissible Rα (p) is the
set deﬁned by the bounds

First note that there is no permissible α at all if (4) is not
satisﬁed. (1) and (2) must be satisﬁed as α ∈ [0, 1] and (3)
ensures α0 ≤ α1 . The extremal alphas can be determined to
be

Inserting these in (13) and (14), one obtains R(p).
IV. D ISCUSSION
Here we show that HC > 0 may be necessary for secret
transmission. In an easy generalization of van Dijk’s result
[17], one sees that I(T ∧ V1 V2 ) − I(Z ∧ V1 V2 ) ≤ 0 for every
input-p where V1 and V2 are independent, meaning that transmission at HC = 0 is impossible, if and only if this difference
is concave in both PV1 and PV2 (not necessarily jointly). This
is satisﬁed for the following channel: let X = Y = {0, 1},
T = GF (3), Z = {−2, . . . , 3}, and let N1 , N2 be random
variables uniformly distributed on {0, 1}. Let the outputs t of
WT and the outputs z of WZ be given by
t = x + y + N1 ,

z = 2x − 2y + N2 .

The concavity of the above difference of mutual information
terms can be shown by elementary analysis. If sufﬁcient
common randomness is available to the encoders, however,
the joint input distribution giving probability 1/2 to both (0, 0)
and (1, 1) can be obtained. If V1 , V2 denote the corresponding
input random variables, then I(T ∧ V1 , V2 ) = 1/2 and
I(Z ∧ V1 , V2 ) = 0, so R0 + R1 + R2 may be positive.
We conjecture this behavior to also be observable for the
true capacity region of wiretap MACs. The relation to the
wiretap MAC with conferencing encoders mentioned in the
introduction will then imply that base station cooperation may
enable secret transmission where this is not possible without.
