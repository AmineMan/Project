not occur for less noisy ordering. Hence our result should
not come as very surprising. However, based on the work in
[7], a natural instinct for beating the superposition coding’s
achievable region would be to show that the maximum
sum-rate achieved by superposition coding region is strictly
smaller than the sum-rate capacity. This fails because, as
we show later, the sum-rate capacity can be achieved by
transmitting only to the best receiver. Furthermore, since
the capacity region would indeed reduce to the time-division
region when all the channels have the same point-to-point
capacity, which is the class studied in [7], we cannot
conclude in a straightforward manner from the results in
[7] that superposition coding is sub-optimal. Therefore, even
though this work is based on one of the authors’ insights in
[7], the counterexample is nevertheless interesting.

Abstract—In this paper we show that superposition coding
is not optimal for three-receiver more capable channels. The
optimality of superposition coding region has been open for
k-receiver (k ≥ 3) more capable broadcast channel. The main
contribution is in identifying a counterexample to demonstrate
that superposition coding is sub-optimal. We also compute
the capacity region for the counter example. On the other
hand, we show that the sum-capacity for a k-receiver more
capable broadcast channel is obtained by transmitting all the
information to the most capable receiver.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Broadcast channel models a basic communication scenario where a single sender X wishes to communicate
possibly different messages to multiple receivers Y1 , ..., Yk
over a noisy medium. For details of previous results on this
problem the readers are encouraged to refer to Chapters 5,
8, and 9 of [1]. This paper addresses an open question in the
book (open problem 5.2), and we show that superposition
coding technique (the main material presented in Chapter 5)
is not optimal for the three-receiver more capable channel.
Determining the capacity region of a two-receiver discrete
memoryless broadcast channel continues to remain open as
one of the most fundamental unsolved problems in this
ﬁeld; yet, there has been remarkable success when there
is an ordering between the decoding capabilities of the
receivers. The ﬁrst such ordering is the degraded broadcast
channel[3] where X → Y1 → · · · Yk forms a Markov chain,
and the optimality of superposition coding was established
by Bergmans[2] and Gallager[6]. Two progressively less
stringent orderings[8] called less noisy and more capable
were introduced by Korner and Marton. The optimality of
the superposition coding scheme for these classes for the
two-receiver case were established in [8], [5], respectively.
The optimality of superposition coding for three-receiver
less noisy broadcast channels was established in [10]. Our
results here show that superposition coding is not optimal
for three-receiver more capable channels. This represents
the ﬁrst instance where an ordering on the decodability of
the receivers is established, yet superposition coding is not
optimal.
It has been shown in [7] that the more-capable ordering
is a much weaker ordering than less noisy ordering. In
particular it was shown that if one substitutes a receiver
(in a two-receiver broadcast channel) by a more-capable
receiver then the capacity region could strictly decrease (!).
Further it was also shown that such a phenomenon would

Deﬁnition 1. A receiver Y1 is said to be more capable than
receiver Y2 if the following holds: for every -error channel
codebook1 of size 2nR from sender X to Y2 , there exists an
-error channel codebook of size 2n(R−δ) from sender X
to Y1 where δ, → 0 as → 0.
Remark: This is essentially equivalent to saying that Y1
could decode any codebook that Y2 could decode.
Korner and Marton[8] showed that the above deﬁnition is
equivalent to the following:
Deﬁnition 2. A receiver Y1 is said to be more capable than receiver Y2 if the following holds: I(X; Y1 ) ≥
I(X; Y2 ), ∀p(x).
El Gamal[5] showed that superposition coding is optimal,
i.e. achieves the capacity region, for any two-receiver more
capable broadcast channel. Note that the deﬁnition of more
capable induces a partial ordering among the receivers (or
equivalently probability transition matrices), hence we are
assuming here that the three receivers satisfy an induced
more capable ordering.
Deﬁnition 3. A three-receiver more capable channel consists of a single sender X and three receivers Y1 , Y2 and
Y3 such that the mutual information I(X; Y1 ), I(X; Y2 ) and
I(X; Y3 ) satisﬁes I(X; Y1 ) ≥ I(X; Y2 ) ≥ I(X; Y3 ) for any
ﬁxed distribution p(x) on X.
First we state(without the standard proof) the superposi1 An -error codebook of size 2nR consists of a set of codewords xn (m),

which, as we mentioned before, is achieved by transmitting
only to the best receiver with superposition coding. In the
above chain of inequalities we have used Fano’s inequality,
chain-rule for mutual information, data-processing inequality, Csiszar-sum lemma (equalities (a),(c)) (reproduced below) and the more capable ordering (inequalities (b),(d)).

one receiver at a time.

Theorem 2 implies that it is not possible to beat the sumrate. What we could try is to beat the achievable region
along some other directions, which is what we will do in
the counter example.
We consider a DM-BC with X ∈ {0, 1}, Y1 ∈ {0, 1, e},
Y2 ∈ {0, 1, e}, and Y3 ∈ {0, 1}, where the channel from
X to Y1 , Y2 and Y3 are BEC( 1 ), BEC( 2 ) and BSC(p),
1
respectively (see Figure 1). Let p ∈ [0, 2 ], 1 = 4p(1 − p)
and 2 = H(p), then from [9] we know that this is a threereceiver more capable channel.
In fact, for this particular case, Y1 is also less noisy than
Y3 and Y2 is a degraded version of Y1 . However Y2 is
only more capable than Y3 . Let C denote the true (as yet
unknown) capacity region and S denote the superposition
coding region.
Suppose the private message rates are R1 , R2 and R3 for
receivers Y1 , Y2 and Y3 , respectively. We try to maximize
the following equation

A. An achievable rate region for the three-receiver more
capable broadcast channel
Since the sum-capacity is bounded by what one can
transmit to the receiver Y1 , a natural guess would be to allow
the Y1 to decode all the messages. Now, one can employ
Marton’s binning scheme to transmit non-nested messages
to receivers Y2 and Y3 .

Y3 the least. Then any rate triple (R1 , R2 , R3 ) satisfying

One can see this by plugging the choice into the region
in Theorem 1. However the channel X → Y1 → Y2 is a

This well-known fact holds since for any U → X →
(Y1 , Y2 ) we have I(U ; Y2 ) = (1 − 2 )I(U ; X) and
I(X; Y1 |U ) = (1 − 1 )H(X|U ) which can be obtained by
routine manipulations. Hence

R2 ≤ I(U2 , W ; Y2 )

Lemma 2 implies that T ≤ 1 if superposition coding were
optimal.
Beating superposition coding region: Next, we will show
that one can actually achieve T > 1. Instead of treating
Y2 as the second best receiver, we ignore Y2 completely;
i.e. it does not need to decode any message. This way
the channel is transformed into a two-receiver less noisy
broadcast channel with receivers Y1 , Y3 . Using superposition
coding on this two-receiver channel, we can achieve R1 =
I(X; Y1 |U ), R3 = I(U ; Y3 ) for any U → X → (Y1 , Y3 ).

coding. Receiver Y2 decodes U2 , W n , receiver Y3 decodes

the computation of the region.

boundary for a binary input symmetric output channels can be computed

using distributions that satisfy P(X = 0) = 2 .

C. A modiﬁed counterexample

On the other hand, we showed that one can achieve the
sum-rate capacity for any k-receiver more capable channel
by just transmitting to the best receiver. Motivated by this
result we presented certain achievable regions for the threereceiver more capable broadcast channels.

Consider the same channel as in Figure 1. Set 1 = 4 ∗
(0.1) ∗ 0.9 = 0.36, 2 = H(0.1). Slightly change the value
of p from 0.1 to 0.11. Clearly since the new receiver Y3
is a degraded version of the old receiver Y3 (which was
BSC(0.1)), this setting is still a three-receiver more capable
channel. As before, we try to maximize
T =

max

(R1 ,R2 ,R3 )∈C

Hence, superposition coding in the more capable ordering
is not optimal.
To show that superposition coding in the Y1 , Y3 , Y2 ordering is not optimal, we can maximize
T =

max

(R1 ,R2 ,R3 )∈C

R2 + R3 .

If superposition coding in Y1 , Y3 , Y2 ordering were optimal,
this would be the same as maximizing R3 , whose maximum
is 1 − H(0.11) ≈ 0.501. On the other hand, by just
transmitting to receiver Y2 we can obtain R2 = 1 − 2 =
1 − H(0.1) ≥ 0.531. Thus superposition coding in the
Y1 , Y3 , Y2 order is also not optimal for this modiﬁed counter
example.
Remark 3. The converse in the last section continues to hold
for this modiﬁed setting. However, since Y3 is no longer an
essentially less noisy receiver than Y2 , the achievability of
the region depicted by Theorem 4 fails to hold.
A natural guess for the capacity region in this modiﬁed
counterexample would be given by the constraints in Equations (5).
III. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we showed that superposition coding does
not achieve the capacity region for a three-receiver broadcast
channel. In fact, we presented a counterexample where
capacity could be achieved by treating the least capable
receiver as the intermediate receiver and the intermediatelycapable receiver the worst receiver. The main purpose of
this counterexample is to show that more capable is a very
weak ordering that does not preserve the nested decoding
properties a less noisy ordering would, at least in the three
receiver case. Then we produced a modiﬁed counterexample
to show that superposition coding (in whatever order one
wishes) cannot yield the capacity region for general threereceiver more capable broadcast channels.
