Action Dependent Strictly Causal State
Communication

becomes available.

Abstract—Channels with action-dependent states are considered: given the message to be communicated, the transmitter
chooses an action sequence that affects the formation of the
channel states, and then creates the channel input sequence based
on the observed state sequence. The capacity–distortion tradeoff
of such a channel is characterized for the case when the state
information is available strictly causally at the channel encoder.
The problem setting extends the action dependent framework of
[1] and as a special case recovers the results of few previously
considered joint communication and estimation scenarios in [2],
[3], [4]. The scenario when the action is also allowed to depend on
the past observed states is also considered and it has been shown
that such adaptive action helps in achiveing a better capacity–
distortion function.

Channel with action-dependent states was introduced in [1]
and the capacity of such a channel both for the case where
the channel inputs are allowed to depend non-causally on the
state sequence, and that where they are restricted to causal
dependence are also characterized in [1]. We underscore that
our goals herein not only subsumes those of [1], where the
determination of channel capacity was the focus, but since
there is a natural tension between sending pure information
(message) and revealing the channel state, a different approach
is required to characterize the tradeoff as the coding strategy
optimal for achiveing capacity may not be a good code for
state estimation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this work, we consider a communication system where
encoding is in two parts: given the message, an action sequence is created. The actions affect the formation of the channel states, which are accessible to the transmitter in strictly
causal manner when producing the channel input sequence.
A channel with action-dependent states then is characterized
by the distribution of state given an action p(s|a) and the
distribution of the channel output given the input and state
p(y|x, s). We are interested in the scenario when in addition
to communicating pure information across the channel, the
transmitter also wishes to help reveal the channel state to the
receiver. We characterize the tradeoff between the independent
information rate and the accuracy of estimation of the channel state via the capacity-distortion function (ﬁrst introduced
in [2]). Our problem formulation is motivated is motivated
by a wide array of applications: active classiﬁcation [5],
underwater path planning [6], [7], data storage over memory
with defects [8], [9], dynamic spectrum access systems [10],
just to name a few. Each of these problems can be expressed
as a problem of conveying action dependent state to the
destination. For example, an autonomous vehicle performing
a active classiﬁcation task has control over how it views the
environment or state S. The vehicle could take actions such
as change its position, modify parameters on its sensor, or
even manipulate the environment to improve its view. Also
the autonomous vehicle is able to take actions adaptively by

Our problem framework can also be thought of as an
extension of [11], [2], [3], [4], as conditioned on the action
sequence the channel is equivalent to the one they study. So
the role of the action sequence in our framework is not only to
communicate the message, but also to setup a good communication channel for both pure information transmission and
state estimation. In fact we show that a two stage encoding
scheme is optimal, where in the ﬁrst stage the message is
communicated through the action sequence and then conditioned on the action sequence, a block Markov strategy similar
to the one in [3] is capacity–distortion optimal. We showed
that although strictly causal CSI is not useful to increase the
capacity, but it helps the receiver to get a better estimate of the
channel state. We also quantitatively characterize the beneﬁts
of feedback of the past states at the action stage. Beyond
merely generalizing previously considered problems involving
coding with states known at the transmitter, we show that
this adaptive action framework captures scenarios considered
in [12], [13] pertaining to multiple access channels (MAC)
with states.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the basic channel model with discrete alphabets,
characterizes the capacity–distortion function, establishes its
achievability and proves the converse part of the theorem.
Section III extends the results to the adaptive action setting,
wherein we allow the feedback from the past states to the
action encoder. Section IV illustrates our results with few
examples. Finally, Section V concludes the paper.

We characterize this optimal tradeoff between information
transmission rate (capacity C) and state estimation (distortion
D) as follows.
Theorem 1: The capacity–distortion function for strictly
causal action dependent state communication is

|{i : xi = x}|
− p(x) ≤ p(x), ∀x ∈ X .

Finally, C(x) = (1/2) log(1 + x) denotes the Gaussian
capacity function.

ˆ
ˆ
that E(d(S, S)) ≤ D and I(U, X; Y |A) − I(U, X; S|A) ≥ 0.
Remark 1: It might sometimes be natural to consider channels of the form p(y|s, x, a). The capacity–distortion expression remains unchanged for this more general channel model.
This follows directly by deﬁning a new state S = (S, A) and
applying the above characterization.
Remark 2: When both the sender and the receiver is oblivious of the channel state, the capacity–distortion function for
action dependent state communication can be obtained by
choosing U = ∅ and is given by,

We assume a discrete memoryless channel (DMC)
with discrete memoryless state (DMS) model (X × S ×
A, p(y|x, s)p(s|a), Y) that consists of a ﬁnite input alphabet
X , a ﬁnite output alphabet Y, a ﬁnite state alphabet S, a
ﬁnite action alphabet A and a collection of conditional pmfs
p(y|x, s) on Y. The channel is memoryless in the sense that,
n
without feedback, p(y n |xn , sn ) = i=1 pY |X,S (yi |xi , si ), and
given the action sequence, the state is memoryless in the sense
that (S1 , S2 , . . .) is independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) with Si ∼ pS (si |ai ).

communication consists of
• a message set [1 : 2nR ],
• an action encoder that assigns an action sequence
an (m) ∈ An to each message m ∈ [1 : 2nR ]
• a channel encoder that assigns a symbol xi (m, si−1 ) ∈ X
to each message m ∈ [1 : 2nR ] and past state sequence
si−1 ∈ S i−1 for i ∈ [1 : n], and
• a decoder that assigns a message estimate m ∈ [1 : 2nR ]

This lemma traces back to Blackwell’s notion of channel
ordering [16], [17] and can be interpreted as a data processing
inequality for estimation.

Corollary 1: The capacity-distortion function CSC (D) in
Theorem 1 has the following properties:
A
(1) CSC (D) is a non-decreasing concave function of D for all
D ≥ D∗ ,
A
(2) CSC (D) is a continuous function of D for all D > D∗ ,
A
(3) CSC (D∗ ) = 0 if D∗ = 0 and CSC (D∗ ) ≥ 0 if D∗ = 0,
where D∗ is the minimum distortion with strictly causal
channel state at the sender akin to the zero rate case in [3].
In the following two subsections, we prove Theorem 1.

It is natural to wonder whether “feedback” from the past
states at the action stage (ai (m, si−1 )) increases the capacitydistortion function or not. For an extreme example, consider
a channel for which p(y|s, x, a) = p(y|s, a). Clearly, the
capacity–distortion function for any such channel with only

message dependent non-adaptive action (an (m)) is same as
that of no CSI, since the action encoder is oblivious of the
channel state. But with adaptive action, the action encoder
can perform block Markov strategy to yield a potentially larger
capacity–distortion function, which is summarized below without proof.
Theorem 2: The capacity–distortion function for strictly
causal adaptive action dependent state communication is

can condition on it and can perform the usual block Markov
strategy on each subsequence associated with each action
symbol, achieving a rate of I(U, X; Y |A)−I(U, X; S|A). The
maximization is a search for the optimal tradeoff between the
amount of information that can be conveyed by the actions,
and the quality of the second stage channel that they induce.
B. Gaussian Channel with Additive Action Dependent State
Consider the Gaussian channel with additive action dependent state [1]

AA
CSC (D) = max I(U, A, X; Y ) − I(U, X; S |A) ,

where the maximum is over all conditional pmfs
p(a)p(x|a)p(u|x, s, a) and function s(u, x, a, y) such
ˆ
ˆ
that E(d(S, S)) ≤ D.
Note that the unconstrained capacity remains unchanged
even if we allow the actions to depend on the past states. But
AA
A
in general CSC (D) ≥ CSC (D) as the adaptive action helps
the receiver to get a better estimate of the state. Finally, by
setting A = ∅ in Theorem 2, we recover the result by [3] on the
capacity–distortion function when the i.i.d. state information
is available strictly causally at the encoder.
Remark 3: When the past states are available at both the
encoders, the encoders cooperate to send information consisting of the common message and a description of the state
in previous block (similar to sending a common message
over multiple access channel (MAC)), whereas in the nonadaptive action scenario, while the common message is sent
cooperatively, description of the state is a private message of
the channel encoder.
Remark 4: In the converse proof of Theorem 1,
we have used the following Markov chain condition
(M, S i−1 , An\i ) → Ai → Si , which need not
hold when allowing adaptive actions and hence the
converse proof for adaptive action necessitates different
deﬁnition of the key auxiliary random variable given by

IV. I LLUSTRATIVE E XAMPLES
In the following subsections, we illustrate Theorem 1 and
Theorem 2 through simple examples.
A. Actions Seen by Decoder:
Consider the case where the decoder also has access to the
actions taken. Noting that this is a special case of our setting by
taking the pair (Y, A) as the new channel output, that U →
(X, S, A) → Y if and only if U → (X, S, A) → (Y, A),
we obtain that the capacity–distortion function for the case of
message depepdent action is given by
A
CSC (D) = max H(A) + I(U, X; Y |A) − I(U, X; S |A) ,

where the maximization is over the same set of distribution
and same feasible set as in Theorem 1. Similarly we can evaluate the capacity–distortion function for the case of adaptive
actions. This expression is quite intuitive: The amount of information per symbol that can be conveyed through the actions in
the ﬁrst stage is represented by the term H(A). In the second
stage, both encoder and decoder know the action sequence, so

Fig. 2.

Capacity–distortion function: adaptive vs. non-adaptive

The proof of the proposition is omitted here for brevity.
Note that since P AA ≥ P A , the capacity–distortion function
is larger in the adaptive action scenario (see Fig. 2). In fact,

4

the minimum distortion achievable with adaptive action is
smaller than that of non-adaptive action. But the unconstrained
capacity (capacity–distion function for D ≥ Dmax ) is same
in both the cases, which implies that adaptive action in useful
in estimation rather than in information transmission. Finally
by substituting PA = 0, both the capacity–distortion functions
converges to the one in [3].

Fig. 3.

V. C ONCLUSION
In [1], they have extended the study of channels with states
known at the transmitter to the case where the formation of
the states is affected by actions taken at the encoder and they
characterize the fundamental limits on reliable communication
for such channels. In this work, we have extended their framework to include the scenario when the receiver is not only
interested in decoding the message, but also in estimating the
channel state in distortion. We have characterized the capacity–
distortion function of such channels when the state is available
strictly causally at (a) only the channel encoder, and (b) both
the action encoder and channel encoder. By realizing that
conditioned on the action sequence our framework is similar
to the one in [3], we have shown that a two stage encoding
strategy is optimal. We have also shown that state-dependent
MAC with symmetric and asymmetric state information is a
special case of our channel model and using our results we
could recover common message capacity results of MAC with
strictly causal CSI (see [12], [13]).

State dependent MAC with strictly causal CSI at both encoders.

R EFERENCES

C. State dependent MAC
Consider communicating a common message over a memoryless state-dependent MAC (see Fig. 3) characterized by
p(y|s, x1 , x2 ), where the state sequence is known strictlycausally to both encoders. This problem can be seen as a
special case of our adaptive action setting via the following
associations:
A = X2 , X = X1 , p(s|a) = p(s), p(y|s, a, x) = p(y|s, x1 , x2 ).
Applying Theorem 2 to this case, keeping in mind the Remark 1 following the statement of the Theorem 2, about
channels of the form p(y|s, x, a), we get that the capacity–
distortion function is given by
S
CSC (D) = max I(U, X2 , X1 ; Y ) − I(U, X1 ; S |X2 ) ,

where the maximum is over p(x1 , x2 )p(u|x1 , s, x2 ) and funcˆ
tion s(u, x1 , x2 , y) such that E(d(S, S)) ≤ D. This setting
ˆ
was considered in [12], [13] and it recovers the common
message capacity results of [12], [13]. One can also consider
a scenario where the state sequence is known strictly-causally
to the ﬁrst encoder, but unknown at the second encoder and
at the receiver. This problem, motivated by multiterminal
communication scenarios involving transmitters with different degrees of channel state information, is a special case
of Theorem 1, we get that the capacity–distortion function
AS
S
(CSC (D)) is same as CSC (D) with additonal constraint of
I(U, X1 ; Y |X2 ) − I(U, X1 ; S|X2 ) ≥ 0 on the feasible distriS
AS
butions. Clearly CSC (D) ≥ CSC (D), since with symmetric
channel state information the encoders can jointly perform
both message and state cooperation as oppose to only message
cooperation when the state information is available at only one
of the encoders.
