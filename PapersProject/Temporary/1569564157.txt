only be satisﬁed by encoding between a huge number (usually
increase exponentially with the number of transmitters in
the network) of independent fading time/frequency extensions
or antennas. However, practical systems only have limited
channel diversity.
In this paper, the designing of IA for cellular networks is
discussed. Our target is to ﬁnd an IA scheme which does
not depend on the special structure of channels. In the other
hand, we draw the idea of relay-aided alignment [7] in the
design. Relay is used to receive signals from all transmitters
in every time slot, then scale and forward the received signal
during the next slot. Due to the additional diversity introduced
by relay, the required symbol extensions can be reduced and
the designing of IA is simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly. Finally we got
an enhanced relay-aided IA (eRIA) scheme. The “enhanced”
is reﬂected in the fact that compared with [7], our scheme
has a wider range of application. Though we only discuss the
designing of eRIA in MIMO cellular network in this paper,
actually eRIA also can be applied to other transmission models
such as GIC and X-channel. And we will also show that eRIA
has a better performance than Suh and Tse’s scheme in the
following discussion through theoretical analyze and empirical
simulation. Higher DoF per cell can achieved and less time
extensions are needed. Speciﬁcally, the time extensions needed
to set up IA can be reduced to merely K + 1 where K is the
number of users.

Abstract—Interference alignment scheme for multiple-in
multiple-out (MIMO) cellular networks is discussed in this paper.
An enhanced relay-aided interference alignment (eRIA) scheme
is proposed. To align the interference, the scaling coefﬁcients
at relay is designed carefully and the design criterions of eRIA
are given. The achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) of eRIA is
derived. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show
that compared with Suh’s scheme [8], eRIA can achieve higher
DoF and require less time extensions.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The management of interference has been one of the hottest
topics in theoretical research for decades. Recently a new
approach called interference alignment (IA), ﬁrst introduced
by Maddah-Ali et.al. in [1], shows that by restricting all interference at every receiver into a small space a higher degree-offreedom (DoF) than traditional methods can be achieved. After
[1], researchers have made a series of signiﬁcant progress [28] that can be categorized into 2 types: signal scale alignment
and signal space alignment. The former schemes are motivated
by deterministic network models [2][3] or the results from
number theory [4]. And the latter tries to align interference
in signal space through linear pre-coding at transmitters and
combining operations at receivers [5-8]. Compared with the
former, the signal space alignment methods are more applicable and stimulate higher interest because beam-forming and
zero-forcing (needed in the latter) are of much less complexity
than lattice coding and minimum distance decoding (needed
in the former). In the following discussion we only care about
the latter scheme.
Though so many progresses have been made, IA is still
far from being applicable in practical systems. That is partly
because most of current IA research progresses are obtained
in Gaussian interference channel and X channel which are
different with practical cellular networks. In [8] Suh and Tse
have proposed a alignment scheme called subspace alignment
which is applicable to single antenna cellular network. However, their scheme depends on the property of single antenna
system that the channel matrix between antennas can be
decomposed into Kronecker product of smaller matrices, and
will meet difﬁculties when applied in multi-antenna systems
because this property no longer holds. Another reason is
the required number of dimensions (number of antennas or
amount of time/frequency extensions) of IA is very large.
That is because to align interference at all receivers sufﬁcient
channel diversity is required [6]. And this requirement can

Clearly, (3) is close to (2) for IMAC. Moreover reference [8]
introduced a duality principle between IMAC and IBC. Hence
the following derived DOF and designing of eRIA related to
IMAC can be directly applied to IBC. The related derivations
in IBC are not shown in this paper due to space limitation. In
the next section, we ﬁrst discuss the eRIA design in MIMO
IMAC when BSs and UEs have same number of antennas,
i.e. M = N . Then results of section III will be extended to
the M = N scenarios in section IV.

III. I NTERFERENCE A LIGNMENT FOR MIMO IMAC
W HEN M = N
In this section, we show the detail eRIA design in IMAC
and derive the achievable DoF. We focus on how to realize
IA by designing {Gt }. And pre-coding matrices {Vk } are
ﬁxed to simplify the operation at transmitters. As we shall see,
the computational and implementation difﬁculty are reduced
compared with conventional IA schemes.

And each UE only detects the intended d data strams sent

from other BSs as interference. By the similar derivation as
that in IMAC and switching UE index and BS index we can
obtain the received signal at UE k as:

where xk (t) ∈ CM ×1 is the signal sent during the t-th
time slot. The transmit power across all UEs is assumed
to be same and allocated uniformly among data streams.
Signal received at relay in time slot t is given by yr (t) =
˜
k Hr,k xk (t) + nr (t). nr (t) denotes the local noise at relay.
The relay scales the received signal in the (t − 1)-th time slot
with coefﬁcients Gt−1 ∈ CMr ×Nr and forwards the scaled
signal during the t-th time slot, i.e. xr (t) = Gt−1 yr (t − 1).
BS c listens to the signal from the UEs that belong to set
µ(c) {k|(c − 1)K < k ≤ cK} and treats signals from other
UEs as interference. Received signal at BS c during the t-th
time slot can be represented by

assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from a continuous distribution. And
quasi-static means channel fading is constant during the transmission. In this network there are C base stations (BS) with
N antennas, KC user equipments (UE) with M antennas and
a relay with Nr receive antennas and Mr transmit antennas.
In this paper, the uplink and downlink transmission of multicell cellular network is modeled as interfering multiple access
channel (IMAC) and interfering broadcast channel (IBC) [8]
˜ ˆ
respectively. During the following discussion, we use H, H
and H to denote the channel fading between UE k, and relay,
relay and BS c, UE k and BS c respectively. And subscripts are
˜
used to indicate the transmission direction. For example, Hr,k
means the fading experienced during the transmission from
UE k to relay, k = 1, 2, · · · , KC. And Hc,k is the channel
matrix of the link from UE k to BS c, c = 1, 2, · · · , C.
In uplink transmission demonstrated in Fig.1(a), UE k sends
d independent data streams mk ∈ Cd×1 along direction Vk ∈
CM T ×d during a period of T time slots, i.e.

From the model deﬁned in the previous section, it is
straightforward to derive the alignment conditions of MIMO
IMAC. Obviously, at BS c interference will at least occupy
d dimensions because each UE sends d independent data

1) Sufﬁcient Condition of (4): Before answering the question how to align all interference at all BSs, we try to answer a
easier question: How to align 2 signals at BS c? If we can ﬁnd
the way to align 2 signals then the alignment of any number
of signals can be done by traversing all combinations of 2 UEs
and 1 BS. The following theorem gives the sufﬁcient condition
of alignment for 2 UEs:

Substitute (7) into (8) we have

Let’s explain (5). The ﬁrst dK columns of Sc are the basis
vectors of intended signal space and the last d columns denote
the basis of interference. k can be arbitrarily chosen as long
as k ∈ µ(c) since all inerference are aligned. Basis vectors
/
of UE k will exactly span the whole interference subspace.
Note there is a constraint condition d(K + 1) ≤ M T hidden
in (5).
(4) and (5) just are the alignment conditions of IMAC. If
(4)(5) hold, the received signal at the BS c spans a d(K + 1)D space. And only d dimensions are occupied by aligned
interference no matter how many interference sources there
are. By projecting the received signal onto the subspace
orthogonal to interference dK interference-free dimensions are
obtained. Then dK DoF per cell is achievable. The achievable
T
DoF is maximized when T = d(K+1) :

¯
as a linear combination of columns of Hc,k Vk , Similarly
¯
we also can prove columns of Hc,k Vk can be expressed by
¯
¯
¯
columns of Hc,k Vk . i.e. span(Hc,k Vk ) = span(Hc,k Vk ).
Now back to (4). There are K(C − 1) − 1 equations
need to be satisﬁed in (4) to align K(C − 1) interference
signals at BS c. Each equation can be rewritten as a group
of M 2 K equations according to theorem 1. Traversing all C
BSs we obtain the sufﬁcient condition of (4) which consists
of M 2 KC(KC − K − 1) equations:

Hc,r Gt Bc,1 = · · · = Hc,r Gt Bc,(c−1)K =

M columns with matrix (Hc,i+(c−1)K V)−1 , i = 1, 2, · · · , K,
and the right-most block with (Hc,k V)−1 . Followed by
putting the right-most block of M columns on the left-most
and subtract it from the rest blocks. Finally we use the M -D
identity matrix on the upper-left to eliminate the rest elements
in the left-most block of M columns. We have

In this subsection we discuss how to satisfy (4) and (5)
by designing scaling coefﬁcients {Gt } at relay. Before the
discussion, we need to decide several important parameters.
First we let d = M and T = K + 1 To obtain the maximum
achievable DoF. Further we ﬁx pre-coding matrices at UEs
as Vk = 1(K+1)×1 ⊗ V, ∀k where V is arbitrary M -D
non-singular complex matrix. We also arbitrarily choose a

Zero-forcing is used at the BSs. In the simulation, we assume that BSs and
relay have the same noise variance for the sake of simplicity. And Gt are
normalized, i.e. Gt F = 1, ∀t to limit the transmit power of relay. Note
that such normalization does not harm the achievable DoF [7].

and b is the column vector consisting of the corresponding
components at the right side of (13). Note that A and its
augmented matrix [A, b] have same rank if A has full row
rank. Then (17) deﬁnitely has solution. Hence we only need
to prove A has full row rank to show (17) has solution.
With the rice-scattering assumption and condition (16), we
have rank(Dc ) = min(M (KC − 1), Nr ) = M (KC − 1) a.s.,
i.e. Dc has full row rank, ∀c. Using the mixed product property
of Kronecker product A can be rewritten by

However, in the above derivation we do not guarantee that
(13) does have solution. To ensure the existence of solutions,
the number of variables in equations, i.e. the number of
elements in {Gt } which equals to KNr Mr , must be no less
than the number of equations. This intuition is veriﬁed by the
following theorem. It shows we can always ﬁnd Gt satisfying
IA condition (4) and (5) as long as the number of transmitter
and receiver antennas at relay is sufﬁcient large.

the maximum achievable sum rate of all intended transmission
links between UEs and BSs in eRIA. From Fig.3, we can see
that the gap between Φ and the theoretical DoF (6)is marginal
and vanishes to zero as ρ increases.

eRIA are stable and have nothing to do with C. It is very
√
different to Suh’s scheme, which can achieve C−1 K C−1
(
K+1)
DoF. From Fig.4(a), we can see that when C = 2, two schemes
have the same achievable DoF. However, when C > 2, eRIA
can achieve strictly higher DoF than subspace alignment.
From Fig.4(b), we can see that eRIA need only K + 1
extensions for aligning. Yet the required extension of subspace
alignment will increase as K or C increases, in particular,
√
( C−1 K + 1)C−1 . When C > 2, eRIA requires strictly less
extensions than subspace alignment. And the the gap in both
DoF and extensions between eRIA and Suh’s scheme will
widen as C increases.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a relay-aided interference alignment scheme for MIMO cellular networks. Interference alignment in uplink transmission are considered. The main contributions of this paper are summarized below:
• In this paper we have given the design of relay-aided
interference alignment. In particular, we have provided
the algorithm to calculate the scaling coefﬁcients at relay,
i.e., {Gt }. And the minimum antenna number required
at relay to guarantee the existence of achieving {Gt } is
derived.
• The additional relay facilitates the interference alignment
in cellular networks. In particular, we have showed that
more DoF can be achieved and less time extensions are
required compared with Suh’s subspace alignment.
• We have derived the upper bound for the DoF when
M = N . And we have provided both theoretical analysis
and simulation results to prove that the upper bound is
achievable by eRIA in practical cellular systems.

IV. D ESIGN OF E NHANCED R ELAY-A IDED A LIGNMENT
FOR MIMO IMAC W HEN M = N
In the above section, we have shown the design of eRIA
for IMAC when M = N . Now we extend the above results
max M,N
to the case of M = N . Here we deﬁne R
min M,N .
Firstly, we show the implementation of eRIA in the case
of M > N . Here R = M . At the UE, RN antennas
N
are selected to cluster R antenna groups. Each group has
N antennas. Then mute the rest M − RN antennas. We
assume the receiving process between the different groups is
independent. Thus each UE equipped with M antennas can be
treated as R UEs with N antennas. Further, the original system
is transformed to KR-user C-cell N × N IMAC. Hence we
can using (6) to derive the DoF when M > N as:

The similar idea is adopted in the case of M < N . Here
N
R = M . At each BS, N antennas are clustered into R
groups and mute the rest N − M R antennas. Further we
disable the cooperation between groups. Then we assume that
there are additional R K − K dummy UEs in every cell.
R
These dummy UEs operates like other normal UEs but they
doesn’t transmit anything. So they will not cause interference.
Similarly, we divide these R K UEs into R groups. Signals
R
from the r-th group of UEs are treated as intended signal
at the r-th group of antennas of corresponding BS, On the
other hand, these signals are treated as interference at the other
groups. Thus, K-user C-cell IMAC is transformed to R K R
user RC-cell M × M IMAC. Similarly, using (6) we can
