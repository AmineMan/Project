Abstract—Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin introduced
identifying codes, which can be applied, for example, to locating
objects in sensor networks. In this paper, the underlying structure
is Z2 where one sensor can check its neighbours within Euclidean
distance r. We construct identifying codes in this network that
are robust against some changes in the neighbourhood monitored
by each sensor. We give bounds for the smallest density of such an
identifying code for general values of r. We also provide inﬁnite
families of values r with optimal such codes and study the case
of small values of r.

Figure 1: An optimal identifying code for Z2 (denoted by
√
black dots) with Euclidean radius r = 5.

Let a network be modelled by a simple, connected and
undirected graph G = (V, E) with vertex set V and edge
set E. We can place a sensor in any vertex u. A sensor is
able to check its closed neighbourhood N [u] (i.e., the adjacent
vertices and itself) and report to a central controller if it detects
a sought object there (like a smoke detector). The idea is to
place as few sensors as possible in such a way that we can
uniquely determine where (that is, in which vertex) the object
is (if any) knowing only the set of sensors which gave us the
alarm (see [10]).
Let us denote the subset of vertices, where we placed the
sensors, by C. In order to ﬁnd the sought object (like a ﬁre)
in our network, we need to choose C in the following way.
Denote the set of sensors monitoring a vertex u ∈ V by I(u) =
N [u]∩C. Let C satisfy the following two conditions: I(u) = ∅
for every u ∈ V and I(u) = I(v) for all u, v ∈ V , u = v.
Hence, I(u) is the set of sensors giving the alarm if there is
an object in u, and since it is unique and nonempty for each
u ∈ V , we can determine the vertex with a object (if there is
any). Such a subset C ⊆ V satisfying the two requirements is
called an identifying code. The concept of identifying codes
was introduced in [8], where a fault diagnosis was performed
in multiprocessor networks.

√
the graph with the ball of radius 5 and an optimal identifying
code in it. For special values of r, this graph has been
considered in many papers, for example, for r = 1 in Ben√
Haim and Litsyn [1] and for r = 2 in Charon et al. [3] and
in [6] for general r. For related results, see [2], [5] and [9].
Since our underlying graph Z2 is inﬁnite, we need a device
to measure how ‘small’ our code is compared to others. To
this end, we use the usual concept of density. Denote a square
Qn = {(x, y) ∈ Z2 | |x| ≤ n, |y| ≤ n} for a positive integer
n. Obviously, |Qn | = (2n + 1)2 . The density D(C) of a code
C ⊆ Z2 is
|C ∩ Qn |
D(C) = lim sup
.
|Qn |
n→∞
We say that an identifying code is optimal if there is no code
with lower density.
The previously deﬁned concept of identiﬁcation is a somewhat idealized view to approach the described locating problem. In particular, it is unrealistic to assume that each sensor
c ∈ C monitors exactly the Euclidean ball Br (c) of radius
r (if in Figure 1 the radius is a bit smaller, we do not have
an identifying code anymore). In this paper, we concentrate
on a more realistic scenario, where the area that each sensor
monitors may individually vary. Supposing ∆ ≥ 0 is a real
number, we assume that the area covered by a sensor c ∈ C
is a subset of Br+∆ (c) such that all the vertices of Br (c)
belong to it. Consider then which sensors monitor a given
vertex u ∈ Z2 . Clearly, the sensor covering u are the ones
that belong to an area, which is a subset of Br+∆ (u) and
contains all the vertices of Br (u). A code C, using which
we can uniquely determine the sought vertex solely based

In this paper, we consider a graph with vertex set Z2
endowed with the Euclidean distance d. Let further r be a
positive real number. The set of edges is deﬁned as follows:
there is an edge between two vertices of Z2 if their Euclidean
distance is at most r. In other words, the closed neighbourhood
of a vertex u = (xu , yu ) ∈ Z2 is the ball
Br (u) = {(x, y) ∈ Z2 | (x − xu )2 + (y − yu )2 ≤ r2 }.
Hence, in this graph each sensor can check (or cover) vertices
within Euclidean distance r. In Figure 1, we have illustrated

on the information provided by the sensors, is called (r, ∆)tolerant identifying (or in short (r, ∆)-identifying). The formal
deﬁnition of tolerant identifying codes is presented in the
following.
Let us denote for u and v in Z2 :

u

v

v

u

u

v

Sr,∆ (u, v) = (Br (u) \ Br+∆ (v)) ∪ (Br (v) \ Br+∆ (u)) .
A subset C ⊆ Z2 is an (r, ∆)-tolerant identifying code (or in
short (r, ∆)-identifying code), if for every u ∈ Z2 we have
Br (u) ∩ C = ∅ and for all distinct vertices u and v:

(b)

(a)

Sr,∆ (u, v) ∩ C = ∅.

Clearly, this formal deﬁnition coincides with the informal
one described above. We denote the smallest possible density
D(C) of an (r, ∆)-identifying code C by D(r, ∆).

(anti-diagonal pattern).

EXAMPLE

The ﬁrst nontrivial ball of Z2 has radius 1 and the next
√
different one has radius 2. In this section, we study this ﬁrst
√
nontrivial case where r = 1 and r+∆ = 2. For any object in
u or in v there must be a codeword (sensor) to separate them.
The pairs of vertices that are the ‘most’ difﬁcult to separate (in
the sense that there are few vertices one can place a codeword
to distinguish them) are pairs of vertices at distance 1. So it is
good to start by studying S1,√2−1 (u, v) when v − u = (1, 0).
We will call this set the horizontal pattern, and for the precise
√
case (r, ∆) = (1, 2 − 1) this set is shown in Figure 2a. One
can notice that it√ only two elements, that means that the
has
1
density of an (1, 2 − 1)-identifying code is at least 2 , since
there must be a codeword in the set to separate u from v.
By symmetry, we also know the vertical pattern depicted in
Figure 2b.
It is easy to ﬁnd a code with density 1 that intersects all
2
the sets S1,√2−1 (u, v) for v − u = (1, 0) or v − u = (0, 1).
One can for example take as a code all the vertices (x, y)
such that x + y ≡ 0 mod 2. But this code will not always
intersect the diagonal pattern S1,√2−1 (u, v) with v − u =
(1, 1), shown in Figure 2c, which is needed to separate u and
v when v−u = (1, 1). If we take the code C that is depicted in
Figure 3, we can show that it always intersects the diagonal
pattern and the anti-diagonal pattern (v − u = (−1, 1)). To
√
show that C is a (1, 2 − 1)-identifying code, it remains to
show that B1 (u) ∩ C = ∅ for all u (this is clearly true) and to
check that it intersects all the other sets S1,√2−1 (u, v). For this
last point, we can notice that S1,√2−1 (u, v), when d(u, v) >
√
2, has always three vertices forming an L-pattern:
(up to
orientation) and that C intersects all the L-patterns. We can
now conclude that C has optimal density and so:

III. G ENERAL R ESULTS
A. Existence of a code
Before we can start to ﬁnd as small as possible (r, ∆)identifying codes, we need to know for which r and ∆
these codes exist. The next proposition gives a necessary and
sufﬁcient condition to have an (r, ∆)-identifying code:
Proposition 1. There exists an (r, ∆)-identifying code if and
only if Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) is nonempty.
We consider the following deﬁnition:
∆m (r) = sup{∆| there is an (r, ∆)-identifying code}.
Proposition 2. When r → ∞, we have
∆m (r) ≥ 1 −

In the following, we will consider only values (r, ∆) such
that there is an (r, ∆)-identifying code.

of U such that y − x ≡ i mod k (resp. x + y ≡ i mod k,
y ≡ i mod k and x ≡ i mod k). As an example, the
set S3,√10−3 ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) (see Figure 4) intersects all the
diagonal and anti-diagonal lines modulo 6 whereas the set
S3,√10−3 ((0, 0), (−1, −1)) intersects all the horizontal and
vertical lines modulo 8.

Next we brieﬂy discuss general lower bounds on the density
of (r, ∆)-identifying codes.
The bound used in [6] when ∆ = 0 is still valid here:
1
.
(1)
3.22r + 4
This bound is good for ﬁxed value of ∆. But when ∆
approaches 1 as r grows, we will have better bound. For this
we will use the following proposition. This lower bound is
sharp in some cases as we will see in the next section.
D(r, ∆) ≥ D(r, 0) ≥

|Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0))|

In the particular case where ∆ is close to ∆m , we obtain
1
that D(r, ∆) has order at least √r which is better than the
order 1/r of (1).

(a)

B. First upper bound
To obtain upper bounds, we construct codes with the following vertical and horizontal lines, deﬁned for a positive integer
k:
v
2
• Lk = {(x, y) ∈ Z | x ≡ 0 mod k},
h
2
• Lk = {(x, y) ∈ Z | y ≡ 0 mod k}.
The idea behind the proof of the following proposition is
that if we take frequently enough vertical and horizontal lines
into our code, the codewords in them will always intersect
the sets Sr,∆ (u, v). In the following x1 (r, ∆) denotes the
point after which the set Sr,∆ (u, v), u − v = (1, 0), always
contains a point of Z2 on every vertical line with abscissa
x ∈ (x1 (r, ∆), r). The exact value of x1 (r, ∆) is easy to
calculate (see the full paper [7]).

(b)

Figure 4: In (a), the set S3,√10−3 ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) intersects
all the diagonal and anti-diagonal lines modulo 6. In (b), the
set S3,√10−3 ((0, 0), (−1, −1)) intersects all the horizontal and
vertical lines modulo 8.

Proposition 4. Let k = ⌊r⌋ − x1 (r, ∆). Then Cr,∆ = Lv ∪ Lh
k
k
is an (r, ∆)-identifying code, and we have:

Let diag(U ) be the maximum k such that the set U
intersects all the diagonal lines modulo k.
The following proposition gives (with some restrictions), for
given r and ∆, a method to construct (r, ∆)-identifying codes.

As r grows, this leads to the following upper bound:
D(r, ∆) ≤

Proposition 5. Let s ≤ diag(Br ((0, 0))) and t be integers.
Let Ld = {(x, y)|y−x ≡ 0 mod s}. Assume that the following
s
conditions hold:
(a) Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) intersects all the diagonal lines modulo s,
(b) Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, −1)) intersects all the horizontal lines
modulo t,
(c) ⌊r⌋2 + 4 ≤ r < ⌊r⌋ + 1.
Then the code C = Ld ∪ Lh is an (r, ∆)-identifying code of

where K is a constant. Combining (1) and (2), we know that
an optimal (r, ∆)-identifying code, for ∆ ﬁxed, has order 1

as r → ∞.
IV. B ETTER CONSTRUCTIONS

FOR GIVEN

(r, ∆)

A. General construction
The previous construction does not use the full symmetry
of the set Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)). We can often construct better
codes using diagonal lines that utilize the symmetry. The
following construction of Proposition 5 gives a method to
construct better (r, ∆)-identifying codes.
We say that a set U of Z2 intersects all the diagonal
(resp. anti-diagonal, horizontal and vertical) lines modulo k
if for all i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , k − 1}, there is an element (x, y)

B. Inﬁnite families of optimal constructions
If in the diagonal pattern there are all the diagonal and antidiagonal lines modulo s, we do not need to put horizontal
lines in the code of Proposition 5, and then we obtain a code
of density 1 . This is in particular the case when s is ﬁxed and
s
r is big enough:

3

r2 + 2k + 1 > (r + ∆)2 so (k, i) ∈ X1 . If x < k, then
(x+1)2 +y 2 ≤ r2 +2k −1 ≤ (r +∆)2 and again (x, y) ∈ X1 .
/
Therefore, the only vertex in X1 is (k, i), and i > 0. This
implies that |Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0))| = 4 and the four vertices
of Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) are (k, i), (k, −i), (−k − 1, i) and
(−k − 1, −i). It remains to show that the four values i − k,
−i − k, i + k + 1, −i + k + 1 are different modulo 4. By
adding i + k, it is eauivalent to show that the four values 0,
2i, 2k + 1, 2k + 1 + 2i are different modulo 4, which is clear.
The last claim is a direct consequence of Proposition 6.

Proposition 6. Let s be a ﬁxed integer.
(i) There exists r0 ∈ N such that for all r ≥ r0 and all
∆ ∈ [0, ∆m (r)] the set Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, −1)) contains all
the diagonal and anti-diagonal lines modulo s in the ﬁrst
quadrant.
(ii) If, furthermore, the set Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) contains all
the diagonal lines modulo s, then there is an (r, ∆)-identifying
code of density 1 .
s
In this section, we give inﬁnite families of values (r, ∆) for
which s = 2, 4, 6 or 8 and |Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0))| = s, leading
by Proposition 6 to inﬁnite families with optimal codes.
We ﬁrst start with s = 2. In this particular case, there is
always a code with density 1 :
2
√
Theorem 7. If r is an integer and if r + ∆ ≥ r2 + 2r − 1,
then |Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0))| = 2 and D(r, ∆) = 1 .
2

Theorem 9. Let k be an odd integer√not divisible by 3
and let r = 2k 2 + 1, r + ∆ =
r2 + 2r − 3. Then
|Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0))| = 6 and Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) intersects
all the diagonal lines modulo 6. If r is big enough, there is
1
an optimal (r, ∆)-identifying code of density 6 .
Theorem 10. Let k ≥ 18 be an integer such that k ≡
√
2
2 mod 16 and let L = k − 1. Let r = L2 + 8 and
2
√
r + ∆ = L2 + 2L + 4. Then |Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0))| = 8 and
Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) intersects all the diagonal lines modulo
8. If r is big enough, there is an optimal (r, ∆)-identifying
1
code of density 8 .

Proof: The ﬁrst part of the proposition is not difﬁcult: if
r is an integer, then for any ∆ < 1, (−r − 1, 0) and (r, 0)
are in Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, √ and they are the only vertices with
0))
ordinate 0. If r + ∆ ≥ r2 + 2r − 1 and if (x, y) is a vertex
of Br ((0, 0)) with y = 0, x ≤ r − 1 and (x + 1)2 + y 2 ≤
r2 + 2r − 1 ≤ (r + ∆)2 and so (x, y) ∈ Br+∆ ((−1, 0)).
Clearly, Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) intersects all the diagonal lines
modulo 2.
For the second part of the proposition, we know by Proposition 6 that it will be true for r big enough, but it is harder
to ﬁnd the codes for all the values of r (this is done in [7],
one code for r = 4 is given below).

Proof: We ﬁrst show that the vertices of X1 =
Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) ∩ {(x, y)|x > 0, y ≥ 0} are (L, 2) and
(L − 2, k). Those two vertices clearly are in X1 . It is also
clear that there are no other vertices with abscissa L or at
most L − 2. It remains to show that there are no vertices
with abscissa L − 1. If there is a vertex (L − 1, y) in X1
then necessarily, y 2 ≤ 2L + 7. But 2L ≡ 0 mod 16, so
2L + 5, 2L + 6 and 2L + 7 are not square of integers,
and so y 2 ≤ 2L + 4. Then (x + 1)2 + y 2 ≤ (r + ∆)2 ,
a contradiction. A simple computation shows that the eight
vertices of Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) are on different diagonal lines
modulo 8, and again we conclude with Proposition 6.

Proof: To prove this lower bound, we use the frame of
Figure 6c. Let F be a ﬁxed set of √
vertices √ Z2 forming
of
the frame of Figure 6c. Let C be a ( 2, 2 − 2)-identifying
code. Then for any u ∈ Z2 , C ∩ (u + F ) contains at least three
vertices. Indeed, F contains two disjoint horizontal patterns,
so C ∩ (u + F ) contains at least two vertices. Assume there
are only two vertices. Then there must be one of the vertex in
a corner, otherwise one horizontal or vertical pattern is empty.
Thus the other one must be in the opposite corner, but that
implies that a diagonal pattern is empty.

all the diagonal lines modulo 4. If r is big enough, there is
an optimal (r, ∆)-identifying code of density 1 .

Proof: To prove that |Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0))| = 4, we show
X1 = Sr,∆ ((0, 0), (−1, 0)) ∩ {(x, y)|x > 0, y ≥ 0} has only
one vertex, and that vertex has strictly positive ordinate. Let
(x, y) ∈ X1 , we have x ≤ ⌊r⌋ = k. If x = k then y ≤ i. If

Figure 7: The ﬁve possibilities for the frame of Figure 6c to
have exactly three vertices.

In fact, if C ∩ (u + F ) contains exactly three vertices, there
are, up to obvious symmetry, only ﬁve different possibilities
for the positions of the three vertices, depicted in Figure 7.
We can observe that for any of those possibilities, one of the
neighbouring frame, i.e., one set v + F with d(u, v) = 1,
contains at least four vertices of C: the frame on the top for
case (c) and the frame on the left for the other cases.
We now give, for any u ∈ Z2 , charge |C ∩ (u + F )| to
each set u + F . We apply the following rule: each set u + F
1
with charge at least 4 gives charge 5 to the neighbouring sets
v + F , with d(u, v) = 1 which have charge 3. By the previous
remark, after this process, each set u + F will have charge at
1
least 3 + 5 = 16 .
5
That means that on average, the number of vertices of C in
a frame u + F is at least 16 . We can conclude that the density
5
1
4
of C is at least 16 × |F | = 15 .

We can improve this lower bound by more advanced analysis. This leads to the following result. For the upper bound,
1
we use the code C of Figure 8 that has density 3 .
