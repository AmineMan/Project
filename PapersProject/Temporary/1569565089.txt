transient behavior of general distributed resource allocation
problems1 .
The main goal of this paper is to understand and quantify
the effect of the number of frequency channels on temporal
starvation in general CSMA networks. We have several new
contributions toward the analytical understanding of multiple
frequency agility.
First, we ﬁnd that the study of temporal starvation in multifrequency CSMA must be done through a hidden Markov
chain. This is in contrast to the single frequency scenario,
where the temporal starvation is merely characterized by a
straightforward Markov chain [3]. In particular, we study
the mixing time of a hidden Markov chain considering the
activeness of each link rather than the full channel state that
not only includes the activeness of the link, but also which
frequency it is using when it is active. We remark that the
mixing time of hidden Markov chains has not been wellstudied before. Thus, our study not only yields new insights
on CSMA networks, but also new techniques for analyzing
hidden Markov chains in general.
Second, we quantify the sufﬁcient conditions under which
temporal starvation can be signiﬁcantly alleviated. While it
is intuitive that having more channels can alleviate temporal
starvation, this is true only when the number of channels is
large enough. Our simulation suggests that the number of
channels being greater than twice of the maximum degree of
the conﬂict graph (i.e. q > 2∆) is a critical condition for
temporal starvation to be substantially alleviated. We conﬁrm
this observation by upper bounding mixing time for the corresponding hidden Markov chain analytically. We remark that
it is non-trivial to obtain the sufﬁcient conditions of q > 2∆
2
.
Third, we show that temporal starvation can be severe
if there is insufﬁcient number of channels. We generalize
Cheeger’s inequality in the context of hidden Markov chains to

Abstract—Mixing time is a fundamental property for a number
of transient behaviors of stochastic processes, particularly, random access in CSMA networks. We use mixing time to characterize temporal starvation, which is a transient phenomenon where
links can starve for prolonged periods indeﬁnitely often despite
having good stationary throughput. Considering a general CSMA
network, we study a fundamental setting with multiple frequency
agility, such that more than one frequency channel is available,
and a link can transmit on at most one of the frequency channels
not occupied by its neighbors. The characterization of throughput
in such a setting is challenging, involving a hidden Markov chain
of the associated stochastic process. This paper develops new
results based on the mixing time of hidden Markov chains to shed
light on the temporal starvation. Our analytical results quantify
the effect of the number of frequency channels on temporal
starvation. We provide sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for
fast mixing time of the corresponding hidden Markov chain.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The study of efﬁcient and fair resource allocation mechanisms in communication networks has been a rich and
challenging subject. While the stationary and long-term behavior has been extensively investigated, recent studies have
only begun to tackle the more practically relevant but also
more difﬁcult problem of temporal and transient behavior in
communication networks [3], [1], [5].
In this paper, we study a commonly observed performance
issue in CSMA networks, namely temporal starvation. Temporal starvation is intrinsic in CSMA networks, which refers
to the phenomenon that links can starve for prolonged periods
indeﬁnitely often despite having good stationary throughput.
We characterize temporal starvation by the mixing time of
the associated throughput process of CSMA networks. We
are interested in how the availability of multiple frequency
channels will help to alleviate temporal starvation.
We consider the general setting of CSMA networks with
multiple frequency agility [8], in which more than one frequency channel is available, and a link can transmit on at most
one of the frequency channels not occupied by its neighbors.
Although the focus of this paper is on CSMA networks,
multiple frequency agility is a basic framework for general
distributed resource allocation mechanisms. For instance, a
node can access a resource (e.g., a frequency channel) when
it is locally detected to be idle and the operation is permitted
by policy (e.g., not simultaneously accessing more than one
channel). Our study provides a foundation to address the

1 An immediate application is cognitive radio – nodes dynamically share
multiple frequency bandwidth spectrum, subject to complex policy constraints.
2 In the literature of mixing time[2], characterization of conditions to have
fast mixing time is normally challenging. A related problem is random
coloring[2](sampling the uniform distribution of graph coloring by Markov
chain monte carlo). However, not only is the complete characterization of
mixing time for random coloring a wide open question, it is also highly nontrivial even to prove fast mixing for speciﬁc graphs with slightly fewer number
of colors than twice the maximum degree of the graphs. When compared
to mixing time analysis of random coloring, our problem not only has less
symmetry but is also related to a less well structured stochastic process (hidden
Markov chain).

model such a network by a conﬂict graph G (V, E) where
V is a set of physical links (each link is a pair of transmitter
and receiver in CSMA network), and E is a set of relations
representing whether two physical links are neighbors to each
other. We let n
|V |. For any v ∈ V , we denote by N (v)
the set of its neighbors. Let ∆ be the maximum degree of
the graph, ∆ maxv∈V |N (v)|. We assume that all the links
have unit capacities. But our results can be generalized to the
case of heterogeneous link capacities.
Similar to standard CSMA protocol, we assume that each
link maintains a backoff counter for each channel. The backoff
value is generated according to an exponential distribution
with a certain mean µ1 . The link counts down all the q
cd
counters simultaneously at unit rate. When the value of a
counter reaches zero, the link transmits on the corresponding channel for a duration that follows another exponential
distribution with mean µ1 . During the countdown process,
tx
if a link senses a channel being occupied by its neighboring
links, it will freeze the corresponding counter, which will be
resumed after the channel is released.
B. Throughput Process

establish a necessary condition for fast mixing. This necessary
condition is on the number of channels. Violating the condition
will lead to serious temporal starvation. In particular, we show
that if q << ∆, mixing time for the hidden Markov chain
scales exponentially with the number of links under a complete
bipartite graph.
In summary, our analytical results includes:
• New tools to upper- and lower- bound the mixing time
of hidden Markov chains.
• Sufﬁcient conditions for fast mixing when the number of
channel is sufﬁcient.
• An example of slow mixing time when the number of
channels is insufﬁcient.
We believe our results add to fundamental understanding of
temporal starvation in CSMA networks and the extent to which
multi-channel agility may help alleviate it.
A. Motivating Observations
Before presenting our analytical results, we brieﬂy provide
some motivating observations from simulation3 (see Fig. 1).
We simulate CSMA with multiple frequency agility on a
simple 4×4 torus network (i.e., a boundaryless 2D grid). Note
that the detailed CSMA model will be introduced next. We test
under different numbers of channels and present the data of
temporal starvation at 4 different time points (i.e. t = 100, 500,
1000, 2000). We observe that temporal starvation (measured
by the throughput loss as compared to stationary throughput)
is signiﬁcantly reduced, when the number of channels is larger
than twice the maximum degree (i.e., 8). Moreover, we observe
temporal starvation is severe when there is insufﬁcient number
of channels.
Motivated by these observations, we seek to provide a
comprehensive understanding of these observations in the
following sections.

At any given time, a link can be in one of the states, C
{0, 1, . . . q}, where state 0 means the link is idle (i.e., not
occupying any channels), and state i > 0 means that the link
is actively transmitting on channel i. A feasible state of the
CSMA network is a vector containing feasible channel states
of the links. Denote the set of all feasible states by
S

where x(v) ∈ C represents the channel state of v in CSMA
network state x.
We can model the evolution of the states of CSMA network
with multiple frequency agility by a continuous-time Markov
chain (Xt )t≥0 with S as the sample space, which we call
CSMA-MF. (Xt )t≥0 is a time-reversible Markov chain with
stationary distribution as

Note that (Xt )t≥0 not only captures if a link is transmitting,
but also which channel it uses. For link throughput, however,
we are only interested in whether the link is transmitting or
not. Thus, the link throughput is characterized by a hidden
Markov chain of the “link-activeness” on (Xt )t≥0 .
For a state x ∈ S, we deﬁne a mapping g[x] : S → {0, 1}n
that maps a state of channels to a state of link-activeness:

II. M ODEL AND P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
A. Basic CSMA Operations
In a CSMA network with multiple frequency agility, there
are n physical links and q frequency channels. Each link has
a set of neighboring links. A link can access a channel if and
only if the channel is not occupied by its neighboring links,
and the link is not using any other channels at the moment. We

Thus, (g[Xt ])t≥0 deﬁnes a hidden Markov chain for the
throughput process of CSMA-MF.

Hence, if we can characterize tHM ( ), we can provide
bounds on temporal starvation of CSMA-MF. In simulation
studies, we usually observe that the regions of fast mixing time
imply that of low temporal starvation (e.g., as corroborated in
Sec. I-A)

E. Main Problem
After relating temporal starvation to mixing time (as a tool
to understand the simulation results in Sec. I-A), we seek to
characterize fast mixing time for the throughput process of
CSMA-MF in the rest of the paper.
In the literature of mixing time [7], fast mixing usually
refers to mixing time being polynomial in terms of n, and oftenly, it is O nr (ln n−ln ) . Thus, our goal is to characterize
the regions of tuple (q, λ) for fast mixing time. Speciﬁcally, we
use the superscript csma to denote the mixing time for CSMAMF. For example, let the mixing time for the throughput
process of CSMA-MF be tcsma ( ). We aim at ﬁnding the
HM
sufﬁcient conditions that
k1

nr (ln n − ln )

(9)

This provides an immediate way to characterize the mixing
time of a hidden Markov chain by that of a Markov chain.
However, We remark that the mixing time of a hidden Markov
chain can be signiﬁcantly different from that of the underlying
Markov chain [6]. Thus it is necessary to directly characterize
the mixing time of a hidden Markov chains to obtain accurate
characterization.
After introducing mixing time in a general setting, we take
Ω = S be the set of all feasible states of the CSMA network,
{Xt } be the Markov chain CSMA-MF and g = g be the link
˜
activeness map in this study.

where k1 and r are some non-negative constants.
D. Temporal Starvation

F. Approaches and Results

A detrimental transient phenomenon is temporal starvation,
where links can starve for prolonged periods indeﬁnitely often.
To characterize temporal starvation, we deﬁne some notations.
For any given b ∈ B, we deﬁne
Px0 (Xt ∈ g −1 [b])

P{Xt = x | X0 = x0 }

The sufﬁcient conditions for fast mixing of CSMA-MF is
summarized in Table I. One can see from Table I region 2
to 4 that fast mixing is guaranteed4 for q > 2∆, λ > 1 .
4 The upper bound conditions for λ and q in Table I can be relaxed to any
other polynomials in n to yield other polynomial upper bounds on mixing

TABLE I
S UFFICENT CONDITIONS FOR FAST MIXING TIME FOR THE THROUGHPUT PROCESS OF CSMA-MF.

We establish these sufﬁcient conditions by ﬁrst uniformizing the CSMA-MF (Section III) and then analyzing the
discrete time CSMA-MF through a modiﬁed approach for
path coupling(Section IV-A) and reduction to another Markov
chain(Section IV-B). Finally, we end with an example of slow
mixing when the number of channels is not sufﬁcient(Section
V).

instead of the Markov chain. This requires a different approach
of path coupling. Hence, we develop a modiﬁed approach of
path coupling in order to obtain bounds for the mixing time
of the throughput process of CSMA-MF.
1) Coupling and its challenges: Given any two random
variables X and Y , we are free to construct a joint random
variable Z = (X, Y ) as long as the marginal probability
distribution function in each coordinate in Z is equivalent to
the original random variable X or Y . Such a construction is
called a coupling, which provides a useful way to bound the
total variation distance of two random variables.
One can consider one-step maximal coupling (a standard
technique in path coupling to bound mixing time in random
coloring literature[2]) for discrete-time CSMA-MF to bound
¯
tcsma ( ). In particular, by applying such coupling, when λ <
1
∆ , we can show fast mixing for CSMA-MF in region 1 of
Table I.

Nonetheless, when λ > ∆ , one cannot obtain similar results
[6] using the same method. Therefore, we develop a modiﬁed
approach for path coupling to work on hidden Markov chain
directly, and obtain fast mixing time for the throughput process
1
of CSMA-MF when λ > ∆ .
2) Modiﬁed Approach for Path Coupling: First, we deﬁne
the path metric (ρ) and a new modiﬁed path metric (˜) in
ρ
terms of link activeness. For x, y ∈ S,

III. U NIFORMIZATION OF CSMA-MF
We uniformize CSMA-MF to discrete-time CSMA-MF by
taking ν = n(qµcd + µtx ) as the uniformization constant.
Equivalently, discrete-time CSMA-MF {Xk } is a Glauber
dynamics, whose state transitions from Xk to Xk+1 proceed
as follows. Note that A(Xk , v) is the set of available channels
at node v.

IV. S UFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR FAST MIXING
A. Modiﬁed Approach for Path Coupling
Path coupling is a useful technique to upper bound mixing
time of Markov chains and thus to obtain sufﬁcient conditions
for fast mixing. However, we study the hidden Markov chain

E[˜(X1 , Y1 ) | X0 , Y0 ] ≤ δ · ρ(X0 , Y0 )

Therefore, whenever multi-color Glauber dynamics has fast
mixing time, CSMA-MF also has fast mixing time. In [6], we
characterize the sufﬁcient conditions for fast mixing time for

multi-color Glauber dynamics by upper bounding tmcgd ( ).
V. N ECESSARY C ONDITIONS FOR FAST M IXING

(19)

To complete the story on characterizing the region for fast
¯HM
mixing time of tcsma ( ), we also investigate the lower bound
of mixing time to obtain necessary conditions for fast mixing
of hidden Markov chains. We note that this study is nontrivial because we cannot use the mixing time of a Markov
chain to obtain a lower bound for that of a hidden Markov
chain.Therefore, we develop new tools, for examples, by generalizing Cheeger’s constant to establish lower bounds. Given
˜ ˜

Then, for all (Xk , Yk ) ∈ S 2 , there exists a coupling
(Xk+1 , Yk+1 ) such that

Using Corollary 1, we can establish sufﬁcient conditions

the regions of large q and λ (i.e. region 2 and 3 in Table I).

Applying this, one can show that for a complete bipartite

conﬂict graph when λ > 1 and q << ∆, tcsma ( 8 ) is
exponential in n. Hence, this corroborates with our simulation
results that temporal starvation can be severe if the number of
frequency channels is insufﬁcient.

B. Reduction to multi-color Glauber dynamics
We note that directly applying coupling or modiﬁed approach of coupling on CSMA-MF cannot offer much insights
for region 4 to 6 in Table I. Therefore, we use another
approach. We relate the mixing time of CSMA-MF to that
of the speciﬁc type of multi-color Glauber dynamics, denoted
¯

by tmcgd ( ) and show fast mixing of tmcgd ( ) in region 4 to
6.
We deﬁne a speciﬁc type of multi-color Glauber dynamics
related to CSMA networks, whose state transitions from Xk
to Xk+1 proceed as follows.
◦ Multi-color Glauber Dynamics:
1) We ﬁrst uniformly randomly select a link v ∈ V .

We study the effect of number of frequency channels on
temporal starvation in general CSMA networks. We investigate
this via mixing time analysis of a hidden Markov chain.
This paper presents sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for
fast mixing of the corresponding hidden Markov chain, which
allows us to understand the simulation observations.
