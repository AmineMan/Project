Abstract—We consider the source coding problem of computing functions of correlated sources, which is an extension of the
Slepian–Wolf coding problem. We observe that all the discrete
functions are in fact restrictions of polynomial functions over
some ﬁnite ﬁeld. Based on this observation, we demonstrate how
to use Elias’ Lemma to enlarge the coding rate region (compared
to the Slepian–Wolf region) for a certain class of polynomial
functions.
We present a classiﬁcation result about polynomial functions
regarding this coding problem. The result is conclusive in the
two-sources scenario and, in fact, gives another interpretation of
a result by Han and Kobayashi [1, Theorem 1].

The classic Slepian–Wolf theorem [2] says that the coding
rate region of the above problem is given by
R[X1 ,X2 , · · · , Xs ] =

(R1 , R2 , · · · , Rs ) ∈ Rs

Rj ≥ H(XJ |XJ c ), ∀ ∅ = J ⊆ {1, 2, · · · , s} .

We consider a similar source coding problem in which a
discrete function of the output data is to be recovered, instead

Subsequently, by combining the standard source coding technique and Elias’ Lemma, Ahlswede and Han [6] gave an inner
bound of R[⊕] which is larger than K¨ rner and Marton’s in
o
general.
Other variations of the general function computing problem
have been studied in existing literature. As a special case, the
original source coding problem is the ﬁrst example with the
identity function to be computed. In [7], the scenario where
one of the two sources is intactly known by the decoder is
considered. The idea of characteristic graph [8] is used in
random code construction. On the other hand, the corresponding channel coding problems in which the receiver(s) is (are)
interested in reproducing a function (distinct functions) of
the output data of the source(s) from the channel or network
output(s) are considered in [9], [10], [11]. The original MAC
channel coding problem where the function to be reproduced is
the identity function is a special case of this class of problems.
A certain type of MAC channel is studied in [9]. [10], [11]
consider the problem in the setting of network coding.
In this paper, we focus on the source coding problem of
computing a discrete function of several correlated sources.
The observation that all discrete functions are restrictions
of polynomial functions serves as an important factor which
works underneath our method. Basically, the structure of the
function considered is what distinguishes this function computing problem from the Slepian–Wolf source coding problem.
Hence, the algebraic structure of a function unveiled by its

ing problem for correlated sources considers the following
scenario: given s sources t1 , t2 , · · · , ts which generate correlated random data X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs , what is the coding rate
region R, such that for any (R1 , R2 , · · · , Rs ) ∈ R and

Let R[f ] be the coding rate region for computing function
f . It is expected that R[f ] = R[X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs ] if f is
the identity function, while in general it is easily seen that
R[X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs ] ⊆ R[f ]. Based on the method of Elias [3]
(cf. [4]), K¨ rner and Marton [5] show that if f is the moduloo
two sum ⊕, R[⊕] contains the convex hull of the union of
R[X1 , X2 ] and R⊕ , where

polynomial presentation is of great importance. Introducing
this algebraic tool to the computing problem is one of the
contributions of this paper. By treating discrete functions as
polynomial functions, we point out that it is possible to enlarge
the coding rate region (compared to the Slepian–Wolf region)
for certain types of polynomial functions (see Theorem III.3,
Theorem III.4 and Corollary III.5). In particular, inspired by
the research of Han and Kobayashi [1], for the two-sources
scenario, we show that the coding rate region for a given
function is strictly bigger than the Slepian–Wolf region if and
only if this function admits a “nice” polynomial presentation
(see Theorem III.6 for more details).

only if there exist bijections φi : Xi → Yi , ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and
ψ : Ω1 → Ω2 , such that
f (x1 , x2 , · · · , xk ) = ψ −1 (g(φ1 (x1 ), φ2 (x2 ), · · · , φn (xk ))).
Remark 1. The equivalency deﬁned does not preserve all
the mathematical properties of two equivalent functions. For
instance, it does not preserve orders of the domain and the
codomain. However, it does preserve all the mathematical
properties that concern the encoders and the decoder. In other
words, it can be easily proved that two equivalent functions
share the “same” coding method, consequently, their coding
rate regions are the same. From now on, we will simply refer
to two equivalent functions as one function.

Capital letters X, Y, Z, · · · are used to denote random
variables and X , Y, Z, · · · correspond to their respective sample spaces. In addition, lower case letters x, y, z, · · · are
used to denote instances of random variables. For a ﬁxed
n, X n , Y n , Z n , · · · represent i.i.d sequences of length n,
respectively. X (i) is for the ith term of X n , X [i) is for the
i.i.d sequence X (i) , X (i+1) , · · · , X (n) and X [i] is for the i.i.d
sequence X (1) , X (2) , · · · , X (i−1) , X (i+1) , X (i+2) , · · · , X (n) .
Let X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs be s correlated random variables. XJ is
deﬁned to be the array of random variables Xj1 , Xj2 , · · · , Xjk ,
where {j1 , j2 , · · · , jk } = J ⊆ {1, 2, · · · , s}. The deﬁnitions

of XJ , XJ , XJ and XJ resemble such a deﬁnition.
In this paper, we assume that, for (X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs ) ∼ p,
pXi (x) > 0, ∀ x ∈ Xi and ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ s, where pXi is the
marginal of p, because if pXi (x) = 0 for some x ∈ Xi , then
we can assume that Xi is deﬁned on Xi \{x} rather than Xi . In
addition, Xi is not a function of X1 , · · · , Xi−1 , Xi+1 , · · · , Xs
for all feasible i. This implies that |Xi | ≥ 2, ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ s.
The support of a distribution p is set to be supp(p) =

Deﬁnition II.3. Given function f : D → Ω and ∅ = S ⊆ D,
the restriction of f on S is deﬁned to be the function f |S :

tions of some polynomial function h ∈ Zp [k], with p ≥
max {|f (D)|, |Xi | | 1 ≤ i ≤ k } being a prime.
Remark 2. In the above lemma, Zp can be replaced by Fpm ,
where pm ≥ max {|f (D)|, |Xi | | 1 ≤ i ≤ k }. Interested readers can refer to [12, Lemma 7.40] for details. For completeness
and to help understanding, we provide a proof of Lemma II.4.
Proof of Lemma II.4: By (1) and Fermat’s little theorem,
it is easy to see that the number of polynomial functions in
k
Zp [k] is pp . Moreover, the number of distinct functions with
k
domain Zk and codomain Zp is also pp . Hence, any function
p
g : Zk → Zp is a polynomial function.

In the mean while, it is easy to ﬁnd injections ηi : Xi →
Zp , ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ k and θ : f (D) → Zp , which implies that
f is equivalent to a restriction of some polynomial function
h : Zk → Zp .
p
In Lemma II.4, polynomial function h is called the polynomial presentation of f .

p(x) > 0 . The support is crucial to the cod-

i=1

ing problem for computing, since only those values (of the
function) deﬁned over the support inﬂuence the problem.
II. P OLYNOMIAL F UNCTIONS
In this section, we demonstrate how a discrete function can
be treated as a polynomial function. Readers who are familiar
with algebra could skip this section.
Deﬁnition II.1. A polynomial function1 of k variables over a
ﬁnite ﬁeld F is a function g : Fk → F of the form

Remark 3. Lemma II.4 says that all discrete functions are
polynomial functions up to the equivalent relation deﬁned
in Deﬁnition II.2. This gives a more sophisticated algebraic
structure to those functions to be considered. Such a structure
will facilitate our further discussion.

the set of all the polynomial functions of k variables over the
ﬁnite ﬁeld F.

III. F UNCTIONS WITH B IGGER C ODING R ATE R EGIONS
By Lemma II.4, we can restrict our discussion to polynomial functions, so all the functions considered later have
domains and codomains as subsets of ﬁnite ﬁelds. For s
random variables X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs , it is easily seen that the
SW region R[X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs ] gives an inner bound of the

where g ∈ F[s], and (h1 , h2 , · · · , hs )|supp(p) is not injective,
then R[X1 , X2 , · · · , Xs ] R[f ].

IV. C ONCLUSION
Considering discrete functions as polynomial functions provides several advantages. A polynomial presentation gives
a function a much more sophisticated algebraic structure
compared to its matrix presentation. This could facilitate
investigating properties of the function and unearthing useful
information. In Theorem III.4, we have seen that a “nice”
summing structure can be utilized via the linear random coding
technique to obtain a bigger coding rate region. For the twosources scenario, Theorem III.6 claims that such a summing
structure is the only valuable one in terms of enlarging the
coding rate region. To the best of our knowledge, for the
multiple-sources scenario, the question of what is the sufﬁcient and necessary condition so that the coding rate region
coincides with the SW region is unanswered (see [1]). We
