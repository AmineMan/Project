bit pipes. This implies that there is no net feedback gain unless
the backward link is cheaper than the forward link.

Abstract—We consider two-way interference channels (ICs)
where forward and backward channels are ICs but not necessarily the same. We ﬁrst consider a scenario where there are
only two forward messages and feedback is offered through the
backward IC for aiding forward-message transmission. For a
linear deterministic model of this channel, we develop inner
and outer bounds that match for a wide range of channel
parameters. We ﬁnd that the backward IC can be more efﬁciently
used for feedback rather than if it were used for independent
backward-message transmission. As a consequence, we show that
feedback can provide a net increase in capacity even if feedback
cost is taken into consideration. Moreover we extend this to a
more general scenario with two additional independent backward
messages, from which we ﬁnd that interaction can provide an
arbitrarily large gain in capacity.

However, this conclusion is not guaranteed to be correct in
general, since the bit-pipe modeling of the backward IC is
a separation approach which can be suboptimal. In order to
arrive at a precise conclusion, we explore two-way ICs where
the backward channel is also an interference channel, but not
necessarily the same as the forward channel. We ﬁrst consider
a simple scenario where there are only two forward messages
and feedback is provided through the backward IC for helping
forward-message transmission. To capture possibly different
symbol rates between forward and backward channels, we
introduce a parameter λ which indicates the ratio of the
backward symbol rate to the forward symbol rate.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The inherent two-way nature of communication links allows
nodes to adapt their transmitted signals to the past received
signals in exchanging their messages. Understanding the role
of interaction lies at the heart of two-way communication.
Since interaction is enabled through the use of feedback,
feedback is a more basic research topic that needs to be
explored towards understanding two-way communication. The
history of feedback traces back to Shannon [1] who showed
that feedback provides no gain in capacity for discrete memoryless point-to-point channels. Although feedback can indeed
increase the capacity of multiple access channels, the increase
in capacity for the Gaussian case is bounded by at most
1 bit for all channel parameters [2]. Due to these results,
traditionally it is believed that interaction has had little impact
on increasing capacity.
In contrast, recent research shows that feedback provides
more signiﬁcant gain for communication over interference
channels (ICs) [3], [4]. Interestingly an explicit analysis in [4]
shows that the feedback gain is unbounded, i.e., the gap
between the feedback and nonfeedback capacities can be
arbitrarily large for certain channel parameters. This result
challenges system implementation as it assumes an idealistic
feedback scenario. So a natural question that arises is to ask
whether feedback provides a net increase in capacity even if
feedback cost is taken into consideration. The ﬁrst attempt
to address this question has been made in [5] where it was
shown that one bit of feedback is worth at most one bit of
capacity, when feedback links are modeled as rate-constrained

For the Avestimehr-Diggavi-Tse (ADT) deterministic
model [6], we develop inner and outer bounds that match
for a wide range of channel parameters. As a consequence,
we ﬁnd that the capacity gain due to feedback transmission
can be strictly larger than the capacity gain due to another
natural use of the backward channel - independent backwardmessage transmission. In other words, the backward IC can be
more efﬁciently used for sending feedback signals, rather than
if it were used for backward transmission of data. Hence, the
overall net gain due to feedback can be still positive even if we
subtract the capacity gain due to the independent backwardmessage transmission as a means of taking feedback cost
into consideration. This shows that feedback can provide a
net capacity increase. The gain comes from the fact that the
backward IC’s use for feedback enables the exploitation of side
information at forward-message-senders to make the backward
IC effectively more capable. We also extend this idea to a more
general scenario where there are two additional independent
backward message [7]. As a result, we show that interaction
can provide an arbitrarily large gain in capacity. Moreover we
ﬁnd that this gain can be larger when allowing the mixture of
forward-and-backward messages for transmission.
Related Work: Sahai et.al. [8] showed that for a twoway IC with two forward messages, there is no net feedback
gain when forward-and-backward channels are the same and
lie in the strong interference regime. On the other hand, we
consider arbitrary forward and backward channels, and ﬁnd
that feedback can provide a net capacity gain for some channel
regimes.

Fig. 1 describes a two-way ADT deterministic IC where user
˜
˜
k wants to send its own message Wk to user k, and user k
feeds back a function of its received signal over the backward
IC, k = 1, 2. We assume that W1 and W2 are independent
and uniformly distributed. For simplicity, we consider a setting
where both forward and backward ICs are symmetric but not
necessarily the same. In the forward IC, n and m indicate
the number of signal bit levels for direct and cross links
respectively. The corresponding values in the backward IC
max(n,m)
are denoted by (˜ , m). Let Xk ∈ F2

and V
The encoded signal Xki of user k at time i is a function of its own message and past feedback signals: Xki =

˜ i−1 := {Ykt }i−1 where Ykt

k’s transmitted signal Xki is a function of its past output
˜ ki = fki (Y i−1 ). We assume possibly different

sequences: X

symbol rates between feedback and forward channels. This
difference is captured by a parameter λ which indicates the
ratio of the feedback rate to the forward rate. This induces
N
˜
n ˜
i=1 H(Xki ) ≤ N λ max(˜ , m), where N indicates code
˜N
length. For 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, Xk is considered as a whole vector
that includes feedback signals as well as null signals, e.g.,
˜N
˜
˜
˜N
Xk = {∅, Xk2 , ∅, Xk4 , · · · }. For λ ≥ 1, Xk contains no
˜ ki should be a largernull signals, but each component X
dimensional random vector to meet the λ-factored feedback
rate. A rate pair (R1 , R2 ) is said to be achievable if there
exists a family of codebooks and encoder/decoder functions
such that the average decoding error probabilities go to zero
as code length N tends to inﬁnity. The capacity region C is the
closure of the set of achievable rate pairs. The sum capacity
is deﬁned as Csum = sup {R1 + R2 : (R1 , R2 ) ∈ C}.

Proof: See Section V.
Theorem 3 (Sum Capacity): The inner bound and the outer
bound (given in Theorems 1 and 2 respectively) match
and establish the sum capacity, except for the regime of
˜
˜
α < 2 , α < 1 , where α := m .

n
˜
Proof: The proof is immediate. Note that the inner and
2
outer bounds can differ only when α < 3 : the inner bound
contains 2λ max(˜ − m, m), while the outer bound contains
n ˜ ˜
2λ max(˜ , m). These two terms coincide if α ≥ 1; differ
n ˜
˜
otherwise.
Net Feedback Gain: Note that in two-way communication,
there are two ways of using the backward IC: (1) Sending
independent backward messages; (2) Sending feedback signals to help forward-message transmission. Using the above
theorems, we will now explain why the backward IC can
be more efﬁciently used for the second purpose, rather than
if it were used for the ﬁrst purpose. Consider an example
where (n, m) = (2, 1) and (˜ , m) = (1, 1). Suppose that the
n ˜
backward channel is utilized for backward-message transmission. The capacity gain offered by the backward IC is then:
∆Csum = λCB = λ, where CB denotes the nonfeedback
sum capacity of the backward IC. In this example, CB = 1.
Suppose that the backward channel is now used for feedback
transmission. Then, due to Theorems 1 and 3, the capacity
gain offered by the backward IC is: ∆Csum = min {2λ, 1}.
Fig. 2 plots these two capacity gains as a function of λ.
Notice that when λ = 0.5, the capacity gain due to backward
transmission of data is 0.5 bits; on the other hand, the capacity
gain due to feedback transmission is 1 bit. Without feedback
cost, the capacity gain due to feedback is 1 bit. Taking the
feedback cost into consideration, we now subtract the capacity
gain due to backward data transmission; hence, a net gain in
capacity is 1 − 0.5 = 0.5 bits. This implies a net feedback
gain.

from the above example that the backward IC can be cast into
two non-interfering point-to-point channels. So the effective
capacity of the backward IC per user for the purpose of
feedback is n. We multiply this by 2, as two stages are em˜
˜
ployed.1 Through the backward IC, user k can now relay the
amount min{2λ˜ , Cfb − Cno } of the other user’s information.
n
In the second stage, each user sends Cno /2 fresh bits on the
upper levels and the other user information (decoded with
˜
feedback) on the next lower levels. User k can then decode
Cno + min {2λ˜ , Cfb − Cno } during the two stages. Therefore,
n
we can achieve Rsum in Theorem 1.
Remark 1 (Exploiting Side Information): Note in Fig. 3
that the two bits (b2 , a2 ) can be fed back through the one-bitcapacity backward IC. This is because each user can cancel
the seemingly interfering information by exploiting its own
information as side information. This enables the net feedback
gain: a capacity increase of 1 bit with λCB = 1 bits of the
2
backward IC’s original capability. The nature of the feedback
gain offered by side information coincides with that of the
two-way relay channel [10] and many other examples.

ACHIEVABILITY

Our feedback strategy is categorized into three types depending on the values of (α, α).
˜
A. Type I: α ≥ 2
Let us explain the scheme with an example in Fig. 3, where
(n, m) = (1, 3), (˜ , m) = (1, 1) and λ = 1 . Similar to the
n ˜
2
perfect feedback scheme, it has two stages. In the ﬁrst stage,
each user starts with sending Cno /2 = n bits on the upper
levels. In this example, each user sends 1 bit. On the next
lower level, it sends an additional bit; as a result, user 1 and
2 send (a1 , a2 ) and (b1 , b2 ) respectively. User ˜ then gets a1
1
while receiving (b1 , b2 ) from user 2. Similarly user ˜ gets b1
2
and (a1 , a2 ).
˜
Similar to the perfect feedback scheme, user k feeds back
the other user’s information (not received yet at the desired
place). But the difference here is that this transmission is
through the backward IC. Suppose that user ˜ and ˜ simultane1
2
ously send b2 and a2 respectively. Then, it seems impossible
to decode these two bits, since each user receives the same
signal. It seems that two time slots are needed to feed back
these two bits. However, we can actually accomplish this in
one shot. The idea is to exploit side information. Exploiting a2
as side information, user 1 can decode b2 , and similarly user
2 can decode a2 . Here the key observation is that with side
information at user 1 and 2, the backward IC can be viewed
as two non-interfering point-to-point channels. In the second
stage, each user sends its own fresh information on the ﬁrst
level and forwards the other user’s information on the second
level: user 1 and 2 send (a3 , b2 ) and (b3 , a2 ) respectively.
User ˜ can then decode its own fresh information a3 as well
1
as a2 . Similarly user ˜ can decode (b3 , b2 ). Therefore, we can
2
achieve the sum rate of 3. Note that the backward channel is
utilized once every two slots to meet the constraint of λ = 1 .
2
We now extend this to arbitrary values of (n, m), (˜ , m) and
n ˜
λ. In the ﬁrst stage, each user starts with sending Cno /2 = n
bits on the upper levels. On the next lower levels, it sends the
following number of additional bits: min{2λ˜ , Cfb − Cno },
n
where Cfb − Cno = m − 2n in the regime α ≥ 2. Recall

2
B. Type II: α < 3 , α ≥
˜

1
2

We explain the second-type scheme using an example
illustrated in Fig. 4. Here (n, m) = (2, 1), (˜ , m) = (1, 1)
n ˜
1
and λ = 2 . Similar to Type I, it has two stages. In the ﬁrst
stage, each user starts with sending Cno /2 = max(n − m, m)
bits, comprised of (n − m) private bits and (2m − n)+
common bits. In this example, each user sends one private
bit only. On the upper common levels, each user sends the
following number of additional bits: min{2λm, Cpf − Cno },
˜
2
where Cpf − Cno = min(m, 2n − 3m) in the regime α < 3 .
In the sequel, we will show that in this regime the backward
IC can be viewed as two non-interfering cross point-to-point
channels, thus making the effective capacity of the backward
IC per user m. So we have used the 2λm for the number of
˜
˜
additional bits. Similarly, a factor of 2 is multiplied due to the
two-stage nature of the scheme. In this example, 2λm = 1.
˜
So user 1 and 2 send a1 and b1 respectively.
1 Here 2λ˜ can be a non-integer rational number, which is incompatible
n
with an input of the ADT model. However, we can resolve this by employing
multiple time slots (say M ) within each stage to make 2λ˜ M an integer.
n

3

In the perfect feedback scheme, user 1 wanted to know the
other user information b1 . Similarly user 2 wanted to know a1 .
And to satisfy this demand, the two bits (a2 ⊕b1 , b2 ⊕a1 ) were
fed back to the users. Suppose we mimic this transmission:
user ˜ and ˜ send a2 ⊕b1 and b2 ⊕a1 respectively. This does not
1
2
work though. User 1 cannot decode b1 from the received signal
a1 ⊕a2 ⊕b1 ⊕b2 and similarly user 2 cannot decode a1 . It looks
two time slots are needed to feed back these two bits. However,
we can satisfy the demand in one shot. Note that the symbol b1
wanted by user 1 is available at user ˜ Similarly the symbol a1
2.
wanted by user 2 is available at user ˜ Suppose we now send
1.
these two bits instead. User 1 and 2 can then decode b1 and
a1 respectively, exploiting its own signal as side information.
The key observation here is that exploiting side information at
user 1 and 2, the backward IC becomes equivalent to two noninterfering cross point-to-point channels. This enables feeding
back the following number of bits: min{2λm, Cpf − Cno }.
˜
In the second stage, each user starts with the nonfeedback
scheme and additionally sends the other user’s information
˜
(decoded with feedback) on vacant common levels. User k
can then decode Cno + min {2λm, Cfb − Cno } bits during the
˜
two stages, thus achieving Rsum in Theorem 1.
C. Type III: α < 2 , α <
3 ˜

the received signals above the level of the corrupted private
signal, since the private signal is not desirable at the other
user. For other regimes, a careful choice needs be made on
the quantization level accordingly, in order to well mimick
the deterministic-channel achievability.
V. P ROOF OF O UTER B OUND
The proof of Csum ≤ 2n + 2λ˜ is based on the standard
n
cutset argument. Also note that the perfect-feedback bound
Csum ≤ Cpf is due to [4], [8]. For completeness, we include
these proofs in the full version [12]. The main focus here is
to prove Csum ≤ 2 max(n − m, m) + 2λ max(˜ , m). Starting
n ˜
with Fano’s inequality, we get
N (R1 + R2 −

The only distinction with respect to Type II is that in this
1
regime of α < 2 , the effective capacity of the backward IC
˜
per user for the purpose of feedback is now n − m. This
˜
˜
is because the backward IC is now equivalent to two pointto-point channels composed of private levels only. In Fig. 4,
remember that user ˜ fed back a1 to user 2 through the cross
1
link, so the transmission rate was limited by m. However, in

˜ ˜
˜ can alternatively feed back
for feedback. For example, user 1
a2 ⊕b1 using a private level, thus allowing user 1 to decode b1 .
Taking this alternative, the effective capacity of the backward
IC per user for the purpose of feedback is n − m. This way,
˜ ˜
˜
user k can decode Cno + min {2λ(˜ − m), Cfb − Cno } bits

during the two stages. This completes the proof.

The deterministic-channel achievability gives insights into
an achievable scheme in the Gaussian channel. This is inspired
by several observations that can be made from the example in
Fig. 4. The ﬁrst observation is that the fed back information
a1 from user ˜ can be interpreted as a quantized version
1
of the received signal (a1 , a2 ⊕ b1 )t at the level above the
corrupted private signal a2 ⊕ b1 . Second, the b1 sent by user 1
at stage 2 can be interpreted as a block-Marov-encoded signal
of a1 ⊕ b1 conditioned on the previously-sent information
a1 . Lastly, a3 is new fresh information superimposed on b1 .
These observations motivate us to employ quantize-map-andforward [6], [11] for feedback, and block Markov encoding
and superposition schemes at forward-message senders. Here
the quantization level should be carefully chosen depending
on channel parameter regimes. In this example, we quantize

enables user 1 and 2 to decode their desired signals, thus
achieving (2, 1).
Mixing Forward-and-Backward Messages: Interestingly,
this interactive scheme includes the mixture of forward-andbackward messages. Note that in the second stage, user 1
sends (˜ a2 ) at the same time. We say that interaction is
b,
strong if the mixture is allowed. On the other hand, if the
mixture is not allowed (that we call weak interaction), the
performance is degraded. For example, we can show that given
˜
the constraint of Rsum = 1, the weak interaction provides at
most 1.5 bits for Rsum . See [12] for the proof. Therefore,
interaction can provide a larger gain when allowing for the
mixture of different messages.
Remark 2 (System Implication): Feedback gain occurs
when forward and backward ICs are different. This occurs
naturally in FDD systems. This can also be created by
opportunistically pairing of subbands for the forward and
backward transmissions.

VI. T WO - WAY IC WITH F OUR M ESSAGES
We now consider a more general scenario where there
are four messages in total: two forward messages; and two
˜
backward messages from user k to user k, k = 1, 2. In
˜
˜
this scenario, the encoded signal Xki of user k is now a
˜ k , Y i−1 ). We will demonstrate from an example
function of (W
k
in Fig. 5 that interaction can improve the non-interactive rate
signiﬁcantly. For simplicity, we focus on a sum-rate pair of the
˜
forward and backward messages, denoted by (Rsum , Rsum ) :=
˜ 1 + R2 ). Note that the non-interactive capacity
˜
(R1 + R2 , R
˜
˜
region is {(Rsum , Rsum ) : Rsum ≤ 2, Rsum = 0} [9].
On the other hand, we will show that interaction gives:
˜
˜
˜
{(Rsum , Rsum ) : Rsum ≤ 1, Rsum + Rsum ≤ 3}. With Type-I
and Type-II schemes in Section IV, we can achieve the (0, 1)
and (3, 0) points respectively. On the other hand, a new idea
emerges to achieve a corner point of (2, 1).
The example in Fig. 5 shows an achievable scheme for the
(2, 1) point. Here we will demonstrate that during two stages,
user 1 and 2 can send (a1 , a2 ) and (b1 , b2 ) respectively, while
user ˜ and ˜ can transmit a and ˜ respectively. In the ﬁrst
1
2
˜
b
stage, user 1 and 2 send a1 and b1 using its own private
level respectively. Meanwhile user ˜ and ˜ send a and ˜
1
2
˜
b
respectively through the backward IC. User 1 then gets the
unwanted information ˜ and similarly user 2 receives a. In
b
˜
the second stage, through the forward IC, user 1 feeds ˜ back
b
to user ˜ using the top level, and similarly user 2 feeds a
1
˜
back to user ˜ Here the key observation is that this feedback
2.
transmission comes for free, i.e., it does not hurt forwardmessage transmission of (a2 , b2 ). Notice that a and ˜ are
˜
b
user ˜ and ˜ own information respectively. This allows
1’s
2’s
user 1 and 2 to send their own forward information a2 and
b2 without being interfered. In other words, exploiting a as
˜
side information, user ˜ can decode a2 , and similarly user ˜
1
2
can decode b2 . Upon receiving (˜ a), user ˜ and ˜ transmit
b, ˜
1
2
the other user’s information respectively.2 This transmission

VII. C ONCLUSION
For the two-way ADT deterministic IC where feedback is
offered through the backward IC, we developed three types
of achievable schemes and derived outer bounds, thereby
establishing the sum capacity except for the regime of (α <
2
˜
3 , α < 1). As a consequence, we showed that there is net
feedback gain for some channel regimes. Our future work is:
(1) Translating to the Gaussian channel with the guideline in
Section IV-D; (2) Extending to general channel settings.

2 In fact, the transmission of (˜ a) must occur in a later stage due to delay.
b, ˜
In stage 2, we should instead transmit new fresh information and perform a
pipelined procedure. It turns out this precise scheme can also achieve (2, 1).
For a simpler description, however, we ignored the delay.
