SFT into the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. The existence of such
embeddings is guaranteed by a general theory in [10]. In this
research, we are interested in concrete constructions of such
embeddings.
In [11], for all integers d (≥ 1), several classes of irreducible
(d − 1)-step shifts of ﬁnite type were described in terms of a
property A subshift, which was explicitly deﬁned in [2] for the
Dyck shift. In particular, for even d, the limit of a sequence of
topological entropies of a class of irreducible (d−1)-step SFT
plays a crucial role in the embedding problem for SFT into
the Dyck shift. We stress here that this value is not maximal.
This condition is peculiar to the Dyck shift compared to the
embedding condition for SFT. In this research, we compute
this limit for the Fibonacci-Dyck shift.
This report is composed of seven sections. In Sect. II, we
deﬁne the Fibonacci Dyck shift. In Sect. III, we give a counter
example for the reﬂection principle in the Fibonacci-Dyck
shift, which implies that the embedding problem in this study
is not a direct consequence of the result in [2]. This is an
important observation on basic properties of the FibonacciDyck shift apart from the Dyck shift. In Sect. IV, we give an
expression of the number of periodic points of length n whose
multipliers are neutral in the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. In Sect. V,
for all integers d (≥ 1), we deﬁne a few classes of irreducible
(d − 1)-step SFT of the Fibonacci Dyck shift. For even d, we
compute the limit of a sequence of topological entropies of a
class of irreducible (d − 1)-step SFT. We also generalize this
result to the Markov-Dyck shift. The report concludes with
the summary in Sect. VI.

Abstract—We consider the embedding problem for shifts of
ﬁnite type (SFT) into the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. First, we ﬁnd the
reﬂection principle does not hold for the path in the FibonacciDyck shift. Then, we obtain the limit of a sequence of topological
entropies of a class of irreducible (d − 1)-step SFT of the
Fibonacci-Dyck shift, where d (≥ 2) are even integers. This limit
provide one of the embedding conditions for the Fibonacci-Dyck
shift. Finally, we generalize the result on computing the above
limit of a sequence of topological entropies to the Markov-Dyck
shift.

I. I NTRODUCTION
An embedding is a continuous, invertible, shift commuting
map from one subshift into another. For shifts of ﬁnite type
(SFT), it is well known when we can embed one shift of
ﬁnite type into another. The embedding theorem is composed
of two conditions: the entropy condition and the periodic point
condition (see [1] for example). However, this is not the case
for the Dyck shift.
Recently, Hamachi and Inoue have established embeddings
of SFT into the Dyck shift. A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for an irreducible shift of ﬁnite type to be embedded into
a Dyck shift is given in [2], and it is extended to property A
subshifts in [3].
The theory of constrained coding for SFT and soﬁc shifts
is reasonably well developed. Recently, problems in genetic
sequence modeling have motivated interest in constrained
coding for certain context free languages, which are not SFT’s
or soﬁc [4]. The Dyck language and the Motzkin language
are mathematical models of input constraints for genetic
sequences. By using Sch¨ tzenberger’s method in automata theu
ory [5], the forms of generating functions for several examples
of constrained coding for the Dyck language are explicitly
obtained in [4]. Topological entropies of such examples are
computed in [6] by using their generating functions.
Topological entropy of the Dyck shift Dr (r ≥ 1) is already
computed as log(1 + r) in [7]. As a circular code, the zeta
function of the Dyck shift is already obtained in [8].
The Markov-Dyck shifts are generally introduced in [9].
Constrained codings for context-free languages considered in
[4] and [6] can be regarded as examples of languages from
Markov-Dyck shifts.
In this paper, we focus on an elementary but nontrivial
example of the Markov-Dyck shifts, namely the FibonacciDyck shift. Then we consider the embedding problem for

II. F IBONACCI -DYCK S HIFT
Let Σ be a ﬁnite alphabet. We call elements β =
β1 β2 · · · βn ∈ Σn blocks over Σ of length n (n ≥ 1). We
use Σ∗ to denote the collection of all blocks over Σ and the
empty block . The full Σ-shift is denoted by
ΣZ = {x = (xi )i∈Z : ∀i ∈ Z, xi ∈ Σ}
which is endowed with the product topology arising from the
discrete topology on Σ. The shift transformation σ : ΣZ → ΣZ
is deﬁned by
σ((xi )i∈Z ) = (xi+1 )i∈Z .
The closed shift-invariant subsets of ΣZ are called subshifts.
For a subshift X, we use Bn (X) to denote the collection of

1

(

all n-blocks appearing ∪ points in X. The language of X is
in
∞
the collection B(X) = n=0 Bn (X), where B0 (X) = { }.
To deﬁne the Fibonacci-Dyck shift, we ﬁrst deﬁne the Dyck
shift as follows. Set Σ = { , (, [, ], ), }. We deﬁne a inverse
monoid (with zero) D: It has generators , (, [, ], ), and 1 ,
whose relations are

We use red() to denote a mapping from Σ∗ to the inverse
monoid D by letting for α = α1 α2 · · · αn ∈ Σ∗ (n ≥ 1),
red(α) = α1 · α2 · · · · · αn

and red( ) = 1 .
Lemma 1 ([2]): If β ∈ B(D), then there exists a neutral or
positive block β+ and a neutral or negative block β− such that
β = β+ β− . The factorization is unique up to neutral blocks.

The Dyck shift D is deﬁned by
D = {x ∈ ΣZ : if i < j, then red(x[i,j) ) = 0},
where x[i,j) = xi xi+1 · · · xj−1 for i, j ∈ Z with i < j.

III. A C OUNTER E XAMPLE FOR THE R EFLECTION
P RINCIPLE IN THE PATHS C HARACTERIZED BY THE
F IBONACCI -DYCK S HIFT

Deﬁnition 1: Let α, β ∈ Σ∗ .
1. If red(β) = 1 , then β is said to be neutral. The empty
block is neutral.
2. If there exists a neutral block α such that β = α , (α),
or [α], then β is called a nested block (α might happen
to be the empty block).
3. If red(β) is a ﬁnite concatenation of , ), and ], then β
is said to be positive.
4. If red(β) is a ﬁnite concatenation of , (, and [, then β
is said to be negative.
5. , ), and ] are called positive symbols, while , (, and [
are called negative symbols.

We use Pn (X) to denote the set of periodic points of period
n in a subshift X. Let pn (X) denote the number of points in
a subshift X having period of n.
In view of Fig. 1 and 2, for each even positive integer
2k (k ≥ 0), there exist two kinds of periodic deﬁning blocks
in B2k (DF ), namely, periodic deﬁning blocks that correspond
to cycles that start and terminate at vertex 1 and the blocks
(1)
(2)
that correspond to the cycles at vertex 2. We use b2k an b2k
to denote the number of cycles of length 2k that start and
terminate at vertex 1 and the number of the cycles at vertex 2
respectively.
In [2], periodic deﬁning blocks of D were described in terms
of colorable paths of the symmetric random walk on Z. By
virtue of the reﬂection principle in the paths characterized by
D, an exact formula of pn (D) was given in [2]. Unfortunately,
however, the reﬂection principle does not hold for the paths
characterized by DF , which implies that the embedding problem in this study is not a direct consequence of the result in
[2]. This is an important observation on basic properties of
DF . We give a counter example for the reﬂection principle in
DF as follows.
We identify any periodic deﬁning block α = α1 · · · αn ∈
Bn (X), where X is D or DF , with a labeled zigzag line f =
f1 f2 · · · fn deﬁned as follows: f starts from the origin of the
2-dimensional lattice plane. fi goes from (k, ) to (k+1, +1)
or (k+1, −1) under the condition that αi is a negative symbol
or a positive symbol respectively. In both cases, let the label
of fi be αi .
Let us consider periodic deﬁning blocks in B2k (D). Then
the number of the associated paths from (0, 0) to (2k, 0) that

Now we are in a position to introduce the Fibonacci-Dyck
shift.
Let F + = { ), ] , )), ]]} and F − = { [, ( , ((, [[}, which
we will think of as being the forbidden blocks. We set
F = F + ∪ F − . For F, we deﬁne XF to be the subset of
sequences ΣZ which do not contain any block of F. The
Fibonacci-Dyck shift DF is deﬁned by DF = D ∩ XF .
The subshift DF is called “Fibonacci” since the subset of
sequences in DF which contain only negative symbols is
nothing but the golden mean shift whose graph representation
is shown in Fig. 1 (For the golden mean shift and its graph
representation, see [1]). Symmetrically the subset of sequences
in DF which contain only positive symbols is also the golden
mean shift whose graph representation is obtained in Fig.
2 from Fig. 1 by reversing the direction of the edges and
replacing the negative symbols , (, and [ with positive symbols
, ), and ] respectively in the graph in Fig. 1.
It is obvious that the following lemma holds not only for
D but also for DF .

For k ≥ 2, we obtain k =)(k = b2(k−1) , ()k =][k = b2(k−1) .

IV. E NUMERATIONS OF N EUTRAL P ERIODIC P OINTS IN
THE F IBONACCI -DYCK S HIFT
To state the embedding condition for the Fibonacci-Dyck
shift DF concretely, we need asymptotic behaviour of the
number of points in DF having period of 2k (k ≥ 0) whose
multipliers are neutral.
Let B2k be a 2 × 2 diagonal matrix with diagonal element

(b2k , b2k ). Formally it is obvious to claim

Similar lengthy expressions are obtained for bk , k , and [ ]k .

Inductively we obtain a short table of values of b2k and b2k .

For a matrix M , we use tr(M ) to denote the trace of M .

Example 1: Consider the periodic deﬁning blocks in
B2k (DF ) that correspond to the cycles that start and terminate
at vertex 2. Then the number of the associated paths from
(0, 0) to (6, 0) that remain below the horizontal line except at
the initial points is six while the number of such paths that
remain above the horizontal line except at the initial points is
seven. The set of the former paths is identiﬁed with
(, ) ][ (, )])([(, )

k +][k +2

j=1

The equality of the numbers of the above lower and upper
paths is called the reﬂection principle [12].
As we see above, we have two kinds of periodic deﬁning
blocks in B2k (DF ). Let us consider the periodic deﬁning
blocks that correspond to the cycles that start and terminate
at vertex 1. Then, for 1 ≤ k ≤ 3, it is easy to check that
the number of the associated paths from (0, 0) to (2k, 0)
that remain below the horizontal line except at the initial
points equals to the number of such paths that remain above
the horizontal line except at the initial points. The reﬂection
principle holds in these cases.
On the other hand, the following counter example demonstrates that the equality does not hold in general for the
numbers of the above lower and upper paths characterized by
the Fibonacci-Dyck shift DF . Namely, the reﬂection principle
does not hold for the paths characterized by DF .

it is easy to check that the matrix-valued generating function

We deﬁne several shifts of ﬁnite type (SFT) of DF . For
each integers d ≥ 1, we deﬁne

zF(gC (z))gC (z) − gC (z) + I = O.
Thus we obtain

All of these subshifts are irreducible (d − 1)-step SFT of DF .
In particular, Xd (DF ) plays important roles in the embedding problem for SFT into DF . To state the embedding
condition for the Fibonacci-Dyck shift explicitly, we need the
value of the limit limd→∞ h(Xd (DF )), where h(X) is the
topological entropy of a subshift X. Similar discussions in [2]
yield

lim h(Xd (DF )) = lim
log tr(B2k ).
(3)
d→∞
k→∞ 2k
We may compute the right-hand-side limit by using the
system (2) of generating functions. However, we take a simpler
way as follows.
We introduce a linear transformation F of the set of 2 × 2
diagonal matrices over N into itself by
(
) (
)
x 0
x+y 0
F

Thus, using Stirling’s formula, we obtain by (3)
Theorem 1:

lim h(Xd (DF )) = log

Since this theorem is obtained from the trace of Cn , we
can easily generalize it to the Markov-Dyck shift DF (a,b,c) as
follows.
The Markov-Dyck shift in [9] arises from a labeled graph
for negative symbols with a symbolic adjacency matrix
(
)

F (a, b, c) =

vector space N2 represented by a matrix

F =

The (i, j)th entry of F (a, b, c) contains the formal “sum” of
the labels of all edges from i to j, or a “zero” character ∅ if
there are no such edges, where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2.
We introduce a linear transformation F(a, b, c) of the set of
2 × 2 diagonal matrices over N into itself by
(
) (

Note that F is nothing but an incident matrix of the graph in
Fig. 1.
Using the transformation F with the identity matrix I, we
inductively obtain a sequence (Cn )∞ of diagonal matrices
n=0
by the recurrence relation:

which is isomorphic to a linear operator of two dimensional
vector space N2 represented by the matrix F (a, b, c) in (5).

k=1 0≤i1 ,··· ,ik ≤n−1
F(a, b, c) with the identity matrix I, we inductively obtain a
i1 +···+ik =n−k

Example 3: Consider a shift of ﬁnite type XB characterized
by the incident matrix

Here B is indexed by pairs in { , , (, )}2 , and we have written
B with row and column indices added for clarity. The graph
representation of the shift XB is shown in Fig. 3.

We have considered the embedding problem for shifts of
ﬁnite type (SFT) into the Fibonacci-Dyck shift. First, we found
the reﬂection principle failed for the path in the FibonacciDyck shift. Then, we obtained the limit of a sequence of
topological entropies of a class of irreducible (d−1)-step SFT
of the Fibonacci-Dyck shift, where d (≥ 2) were even integers.
Finally, we generalized the result on computing the above limit
of a sequence of topological entropies to the Markov-Dyck
shift.
