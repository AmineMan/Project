Polar codes for q -ary channels, q = 2r

that virtual channels for the transmitted symbols converge to
one of r+1 extremal conﬁgurations in which j out of r bits are
transmitted near-perfectly while the remaining r − j bits carry
almost no information. Moreover, the good bits are always
aligned to the right of the transmitted r-block, and no other
situations arise in the limit. Thus, the extremal conﬁgurations
for information rates that arise as a result of polarization are
easily characterized: they form an upper-triangular matrix as
described in Sect. II-B.
Another related work is the paper by Abbe and Telatar
[4]. In it, the authors observed multilevel polarization under
the (F2 )r addition. The main result of their paper provides a
characterization of extremal points of the region of attainable
rates when polar codes are used for each of the r users of
a multiple-access channel. This result applies to a singleuser channel, but does not lead to an easy description of the
extremal conﬁgurations.
Polarization of the kind established in this paper was also
observed in a concurrent independent work by Sahebi and
Pradhan [5].

Abstract—We study polarization for nonbinary channels with
input alphabet of size q = 2r , r = 2, 3, . . . . Using Arıkan’s
polarizing kernel H2 , we prove that virtual channels that arise
in the process of polarization converge to q-ary channels with
capacity 1, 2, . . . , r bits, and that the total transmission rate
approaches the symmetric capacity of the channel. This leads
to an explicit transmission scheme for q-ary channels. The error
probability of decoding using successive cancellation behaves as
exp(−N α ), where N is the code length and α is any constant
less than 0.5.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Polarization was ﬁrst described by Arıkan [1] who constructed binary codes that achieve capacity of symmetric
memoryless channels (and “symmetric capacity” of general
binary-input channels). The main idea of [1] is to combine
the bits of the source sequence using repeated application of
10
the “polarization kernel” H2 = 1 1 . The resulting linear
code of length N = 2n has the generator matrix which forms
⊗n
a submatrix of GN = BH2 , where B is a permutation
matrix. The choice of the rows of GN is governed by the
polarization of virtual channels for individual bits that arise
in the process of channel combining and splitting. Namely,
the data bits are written in the coordinates that correspond to
near-perfect channels while the other bits are ﬁxed to some
values known to both the transmitter and the decoder.
A study of polar codes for channels with nonbinary input
was undertaken by Saso˘ lu et al. [2] and Mori and Tanaka
¸ ¸ g
[3]. For prime q, it sufﬁces to take the kernel H2 , while
for nonprime alphabets, the kernel is time-varying and not
explicit. [2] remarks that the transmission scheme that uses
the kernel H2 with modulo-q addition for composite q does
not necessarily lead to the polarization of the channels to the
two extremes. The authors of [2] suggest several alternatives
to the kernel H2 that rely on randomized permutations or, in
the case of q = 2r , on multilevel schemes that implement
polar coding for each of the bits of the symbol independently,
combining them in the decoding procedure.
In this paper we study polarization for channels with input
alphabet of size q = 2r , r = 2, 3, . . . . Suppose that the
channel is given by a stochastic matrix W (y|x) where x ∈
X , y ∈ Y, X = {0, 1, . . . , q − 1}, and Y is a ﬁnite alphabet.
Assuming that the channel combining is performed using the
kernel H2 with addition modulo q, we establish results about
the polarization of channels for individual symbols. It turns out

II. P OLARIZATION FOR q- ARY CHANNELS
We consider combining of the q-ary data under the action
of the operator H2 , where q = 2r , r ≥ 2. Let W : X →
Y, |X | = q be a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). The
symmetric capacity of the channel W equals
I(W )

where the base of the logarithm is 2. Deﬁne the combined
channel W2 and the channels W − and W + by
W2 (y1 , y2 |u1 , u2 ) = W (y1 |u1 + u2 )W (y2 |u2 ),
W − (y1 , y2 |u1 ) =
u2 ∈X

W + (y1 , y2 , u1 |u2 ) =

where u1 , u2 , y1 , y2 are r-vectors and + is a modulo-q
sum. This transformation can be applied recursively to the
channels W − , W + resulting in four channels of the form
W b1 b2 , b1 , b2 ∈ {+, −}. After n steps we obtain N = 2n
(j)
channels WN , j = 1, . . . , N. For the case q = 2 it is shown
(j)
in [1] that as n increases, the channels WN become either
almost perfect or almost completely noisy (polarize). In formal
terms, for any ε > 0

Recall the setting of [1] for the evolution of the channel
parameters. On the set Ω = {+, −}∗ of semi-inﬁnite binary
sequences deﬁne a σ-algebra F on Ω generated by the cylinder
sets S(b1 , . . . , bn ) = {ω ∈ Ω : ω1 = b1 , . . . , ωn = bn } for all
sequences (b1 , . . . , bn ) ∈ {+, −}n and for all n ≥ 0. Consider
the probability space (Ω, F , P ), where P (S(b1 , . . . , bn )) =

F0 = {∅, Ω} and Fn , n ≥ 1 is generated by the cylinder sets
S(b1 , . . . , bn ), bi ∈ {+, −}.
Let Bi , i = 1, 2, · · · be i.i.d. {+, −}-valued random variables with Pr(B1 = +) = Pr(B1 = −) = 1/2. The random
channel emerging at time n will be denoted by W B , where

B = (B1 , B2 , · · · , Bn ). Thus, P (W B = WN ) = 2−n for all

random variables are adapted to the above ﬁltration (meaning
that In etc. are measurable w.r.t. Fn for every n ≥ 1).

For r = 1 these inequalities are proved in [1]. For r > 1
Eq. (6) is a restatement of [2, Prop. 3]. The fact that (7) holds
for all r > 1 is proved in [6].
..
Inequalities (6)-(7) imply that if (Z1 , √ . , Zr ) ∈ Rk (ε) then
|I(W )−(r −k)| ≤ δ where δ = max(k ε, (2r−k −1)ε log e).
The following proposition is an immediate corollary of the
above results.
Proposition 2: (a) The random variable I∞ is supported on
the set {0, 1, . . . , r}.

such that

choice of ε

{|In − (r − k)| ≤ δ} ⊃ Bk,n (ε)

In this section we state a sequence of results that shows
that q-ary polar codes based on the kernel H2 can be used to
transmit reliably over the channel W for all rates R < I(W ).
The proofs for the most part are given in [6].

for all n ≥ 0. At the same time, P ({|In − (r − k)| ≤ δ} ∩
◦
Bk ,n (ε)) = 0 for all k = k, and P (∪ Bk,n (ε)) → 1 for
any ε > 0. Together this implies (b). Finally, we have that

Zi,∞ = 0}|) = r kP (I∞ = k) = I(W ).

j ∈ Ak,n refers to an r-bit symbol in which r − k rightmost
(j)
bits correspond to small values of Zi (WN ). To transmit data
over the channel, we write the data bits in these coordinates
and encode them using the linear transformation GN .
More speciﬁcally, let us order the coordinates j ∈ [N ]
(j)
r
by the increase of the quantity i=1 2i−1 Zi (WN ) and use
these numbers to locate the subsets Ak,n . We transmit data
by encoding messages uN = (u1 , . . . , uN ) in which if
1
j ∈ Ak,n , k = 0, . . . , r − 1 then the symbol uj is taken from
the subset of symbols of X with the ﬁrst k symbols ﬁxed
and known to both the encoder and the decoder ([1] calls
them frozen bits). In particular, the subset Ar,n is not used to
transmit data. A polar codeword is computed as xN = uN GN

and sent over the channel.
Decoding is performed using the “successive cancellation”
procedure of [1] with the obvious constraints on the symbol
values. Namely, for j = 1, . . . , N put

We can say a bit more about the nature of convergence
established in this proposition. Let us ﬁx k ∈ {0, 1, . . . , r}
and deﬁne the channel for the r − k rightmost bits of the
transmitted symbol as follows:
W [r−k] (y|u) =

1
2k

u ∈ {0, 1}r−k

W (y|x),
x∈X :xr =u
k+1

where x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xr ).

Lemma 2: Let V : X → Y be a DMC and let δ > 0. Suppose that (Z1,n (V ), Z2,n (V ), . . . , Zr,n (V )) ∈ Rk (ε), for some
0 ≤ k ≤ r. If ε is sufﬁciently small, then I(V [r−k] ) ≥ r−k−δ.
In particular, it sufﬁces to take ε ≤ (2k+δ − 1)/23r+k−1 .
It turns out that the channels for individual bits converge to
either perfect or fully noisy channels. If the channel for bit j
is perfect then the channels for all bits i, r ≥ i > j are perfect.
If the channel for bit i is noisy then the channels for all bits
j, 1 ≤ j < i are noisy. The total number of near-perfect bits
approaches I(W ). This is made formal in the next proposition.
Proposition 3: Let Ωk = {ω : (Z1,∞ , Z2,∞ , . . . , Zr,∞ ) =
1k 0r−k }, k = 0, 1, . . . , r. For every ω ∈ Ωk

j ∈ Ar,n
j ∈ ∪k≤r−1 Ak,n

where if j ∈ Ak,n , k = 0, 1, . . . , r − 1, then the maximum
is computed over the symbols x ∈ X with the ﬁxed (known)
values of the ﬁrst k bits.
The error probability of this decoding is estimated in
Sect. II-E.

we conclude that for such ω also I(Wn

D. Proof of Theorem 1: an outline
Part (a) of Theorem 1 follows straightforwardly from [1],
[2]. Namely, as shown in [1, Prop. 4], I(W + ) + I(W − ) =
2I(W ). We note that the proof in [1] uses only the fact that
u1 , u2 are recoverable from x1 , x2 which is true in our case.
Hence the sequence In , n ≥ 1 forms a bounded martingale. By
Doob’s theorem it converges a.e. in L1 (Ω, F , P ) to a random
variable I∞ with E(I∞ ) = I(W ).
To prove part (b) we show that each of the Zi,n ’s converges
a.s. to a (0, 1) Bernoulli random variable Zi,∞ . This convergence occurs in a concerted way in that the limit r.v.’s obey
Zj,∞ ≥ Zi,∞ a.e. if j < i. This is shown by observing that
for any ﬁxed i = 1, . . . , r and for all v ∈ Xi , the Zv,n (W )
converge to identical copies of a Bernoulli random variable.

The concluding claim of this section describes the channel
polarization and establishes that the total number of bits sent
over almost noiseless channels approaches N I(W ).

Let us describe a scheme of transmitting over the channel

(i) Un ∈ [0, 1]
2
(ii) P (Un+1 = Un |Fn ) ≥ 1/2
(iii) Un+1 ≤ qUn for some q ∈ Z+ .
Then there are events Ω0 , Ω1 such that P (Ω0 ∪ Ω1 ) = 1 and
Un (ω) → i for ω ∈ Ωi , i = 0, 1.
Proof: (a) First let us rescale the process Un so that in
the neighborhood of zero it has a drift to zero. Let β ∈ (0, 1)
be such that
q β − 1 < 1/4.

[0, ( 4 ) β ] and R := [1 − δ, 1]. Observe that the process Un

cannot move from L to R without visiting C := (( 1 ) β , 1−δ).

Let σ1 be the ﬁrst time when Un ∈ C, let η1 be the ﬁrst time
after σ1 when Un ∈ L ∪ R, let σ2 be the ﬁrst time after η1
when Un ∈ C, etc., σ1 < η1 < σ2 < η2 < . . . . We shall prove
that every sample path of the process eventually stays outside
C, i.e., that for almost all ω there exists k = k(ω) < ∞ such
that σk (ω) = ∞.
Assume the contrary, i.e., limk→∞ P (σk < ∞) = α > 0
(since P (σk+1 < ∞) < P (σk < ∞), this limit exists.) We
have

Let Xn = Un . Take τ (ω) to be the ﬁrst time when Xn (ω) ≥

while on the event Yn < 1/2 we have

This implies that the sequence Yn , n ≥ 0 forms a supermartingale which is bounded between 0 and 1. By the convergence
theorem, Yn → Y∞ a.e. and in L1 (Ω, F , P ), where Y∞
is a random variable supported on [0, 1]. This implies that
EY0 ≥ EYn ↓ EY∞ . Further, if X0 ∈ [0, 1/4] then (since

Consider the process Un = Uσk +n on the event σk < ∞

P (UJ ∈ L) ≥ 2−J by property (ii). Now consider the process

uniformly in k. But then the sum in (20) is equal to inﬁnity,
a contradiction.
(e) The proof is completed by showing that the probability
of Un staying in Rc = [0, 1]\R without converging to zero
is zero. We know that almost all trajectories stay outside C,
so suppose that the process starts in (0, (1/2)1/β ). Then the
probability that it enters L in a ﬁnite number of steps is
uniformly bounded from below (this is shown similarly to
(20)), so the probability that it does not go to L is zero. Next

for all n ≥ 0. Suppose that Y∞ takes values in (δ, 1/2 − δ)
with probability α > 0. Let An = {ω : Yn ∈ (δ, 1/2 − δ)}.
Since Yn → Y∞ a.e., the Egorov theorem implies that there
is a subset of probability arbitrarily close to P (An ) which

W (0|2) = W (1|1) = W (1|3) = 1. This channel has capacity
1 bit. Computing the channels W + and W − we ﬁnd that
they are equivalent to the original channel W . The conclusion
reached in [2] was that there are nonbinary channels that do
not polarize under the action of H2 .
We observe that the above channel corresponds to the extremal conﬁguration (10) in (5) (the other two conﬁgurations
arise with probability 0), and therefore is a stable point of the
channel combining operation. It is possible to reach capacity
by transmitting the least signiﬁcant bit of every symbol.

assume that the process starts in L, then by (19) it either goes
to zero or enters C with probability one. Together with part
(d) this implies that the process that starts in L converges to
zero or one with probability one.

Lemma 5: Let V : X → Y be a channel. Let v, v ∈ X \{0}
be such that wtr (v) ≥ wtr (v ). For any δ > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that Zv (V ) ≥ 1 − δ whenever Zv (V ) ≥ 1 − δ . In
particular, we can take δ = δ q −3 .
This lemma is proved by relating Z(Vx,x ) to the Eu˜
clidean distance between the vectors ( V (y|x), y ∈ Y) and
˜ and some geometric arguments [6].

Theorem 3: Let 0 < α < 1/2. For any DMC W : X → Y

of r-tuples of disjoint subsets A0,N , . . . , Ar−1,N of [N ] such

where Zmax,∞ is a Bernoulli random variable supported on
{0, 1}.
Convergence of the rv’s Zv,n is established in the following
lemma.
Lemma 7: Zv,n → Zv,∞ a.e., where Zv,∞ is a (0, 1)valued random variable whose distribution depends only on the
ordered weight wtr (v).

The next theorem gives an estimate of the block error rate.

2) Proof of Part (b) of Theorem 1:
Lemma 8: For any i = 1, . . . , r, the random variable Zi,n
converges a.e. to a (0, 1)-valued random variable Zi,∞ . Moreover, Zi,∞ → 1 implies that Zi−1,∞ → 1 a.e.
The ﬁrst part follows because all the Zv , v ∈ Xi converge to
identical copies of the same random variable. The second part
holds true because Lemma 5 allows us to move from higherweight symbols v in Zv to lower-weight symbols [6].

F. Examples
A simple example is given by the ordered erasure channel,
deﬁned as Wr : Fr → (Fq ∪ {?})r , where

Now the proof of Theorem 1(b) can be completed as
follows. We obtain that Zi,∞ is a (0, 1) random variable a.e.
and for all i, and if Zi,∞ = 1 then Zj,∞ = 1 for all 1 ≤ j < i.

We need to prove that with probability one, the vector

probability one Zr,∞ = 1 or 0. If it is equal to 1 then
necessarily Zr−1,∞ = · · · = Z1,∞ = 1. Otherwise Zr,∞ = 0.
In this case it is possible that Zr−1,∞ = 1 (in which case

If Zr−1,∞ = 0 then the possibilities are Zr−2,∞ = 1 or 0, up
to another event of probability 0, and so on. Thus, the union
of the disjoint events given by (5) holds with probability one.
These arguments complete the proof.
