that the communication between the end nodes can be done
using a two phase protocol. The design principles governing
the choice of modulation schemes to be used at the nodes for
uncoded transmission were studied in [3].
It was observed in [3] that for uncoded transmission, the
network coding map used at the relay needs to be changed
adaptively according to the channel fade coefﬁcient, in order
to minimize the impact of the Multiple Access Interference
(MAI). For the single antenna two-way relaying scenario,
a computer search algorithm called the Closest-Neighbour
Clustering (CNC) algorithm was proposed in [3] to obtain the
adaptive network coding maps resulting in the best distance
proﬁle at R. An alternative procedure to obtain the network
coding maps, based on the removal of deep channel fade
conditions using Latin Squares was proposed in [4]. A quantization of the set of all possible channel realizations based on
the network code used was obtained analytically in [5].
The CNC algorithm extended to the MIMO scenario in [6],
is run for a given channel realization. The total number of
network coding maps which would result is known only after
the algorithm is run for all possible channel realizations which
is uncountably inﬁnite. Hence, the number of overhead bits required is not known beforehand. In this paper, it is shown that
for the MIMO two-way relaying scenario, the MAI becomes
severe when the row space of the channel fade coefﬁcient
matrix is a subspace of a ﬁnite number of vector subspaces
of CnA +nB referred to as the singular fade subspaces. The
proposed scheme is based on the removal of singular fade
subspaces. Since the number of such vector subspaces is ﬁnite,
the number of overhead bits required is known beforehand.
Also, for the proposed scheme, obtaining the network coding
maps reduces to completing a ﬁnite number of partially ﬁlled
Latin Rectangles, which avoids the problem of performing
exhaustive search for an uncountably inﬁnite number of values.
For the SISO two-way relaying scenario, the effect of
the MAI is totally captured by a single complex number
which is the ratio of the channel fade coefﬁcients [3], [4].
In contrast, for the MIMO two-way relaying scenario, the
deep channel fade conditions, which cannot be described by
a single complex number, have an interesting vector subspace
interpretation in terms of the singular fade subspaces.
Notations: CN (0, σ 2 In ) denotes the circularly symmetric
complex Gaussian random vector of length n with covariance
matrix σ 2 In , where In is the identity matrix of order n. The

subspaces considered in this paper are over the complex ﬁeld

Abstract—The design of modulation schemes for the physical layer network-coded two-way MIMO relaying scenario is
considered, with the denoise-and-forward (DNF) protocol which
employs two phases: Multiple access (MA) phase and Broadcast
(BC) phase. It is shown that for MIMO two-way relaying, deep
fade occurs at the relay when the row space of the channel fade
coefﬁcient matrix is a subspace of a ﬁnite number of vector
subspaces which are referred to as the singular fade subspaces.
It is shown that proper choice of network coding map obtained
by the completion of appropriate partially ﬁlled Latin Rectangle
can remove most of the singular fade subspaces, referred to as
the removable singular fade subspaces. For 2λ -PSK signal set, the
number of removable and non-removable singular fade subspaces
are obtained analytically and it is shown that the number of nonremovable singular fade subspaces is a small fraction of the total
number of singular fade subspaces. The Latin Rectangles for the
case when the end nodes use different number of antennas are
shown to be obtainable from the Latin Squares for the case when
they use the same number of antennas, irrespective of the number
of antennas at the relay. For 2λ -PSK signal set, the singular
fade subspaces which are removed by the conventional XOR
network code are identiﬁed. Also, using the notions of isotopic
and transposed Latin Squares, the network coding maps which
remove all the removable singular singular fade subspaces are
shown to be obtainable from a small set of Latin Squares.

I. BACKGROUND AND P RELIMINARIES
We consider the two-way wireless relaying scenario shown
in Fig.1 with nA , nB and nR antennas respectively at nodes A,
B and R (Fig. 1). Two-way data transfer takes place between
the nodes A and B with the help of the relay R. It is assumed
that all the three nodes operate in half-duplex mode, i.e.,
they cannot transmit and receive simultaneously in the same
frequency band. We consider the denoise-and-forward (DNF)
protocol originally introduced in [1], which consists of the
following two phases: the multiple access (MA) phase, during
which A and B simultaneously transmit to R and the broadcast
(BC) phase during which R transmits to A and B. Network
coding map, which is also referred to as the denoising map, is
chosen at R in such a way that A (B) can decode the messages
of B (A), given that A (B) knows its own messages.

The Two Way Relay Channel

The idea of physical layer network coding for the two way
relay channel was ﬁrst introduced in [2], where the multiple
access interference occurring at the relay was exploited so

C. Let span(c1 , c2 , . . . cL ) denote the vector space over C
spanned by the complex vectors c1 , c2 , . . . cL ∈ Cn . For a
vector subspace V of Cn , V ⊥ denotes the vector subspace
{x : xT v = 0 ∀v ∈ V }. For a matrix H ∈ Cm×n , R(H)

restriction placed on the number of antennas at the relay nR .
For a vector x, x[i:j] , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n denotes the vector

Depending on HR , R chooses a many-to-one map MHR :
S
→ S ′ , where S ′ ⊂ CnR is the signal set (of
size between max {M nA , M nB } and M nA +nB ) used by R
during the BC phase. Note that |S ′ | should be at least
max {M nA , M nB }, to transmit max{λnA , λnB } information
bits. The elements in S nA +nB which are mapped on to the
same complex vector in S ′ by the map MHR are said to form
a cluster. Let {L0 , L2 , ..., Lt−1 } denote the set of all such
clusters. The formation of clusters for HR is called clustering,
and is denoted by C HR . For simplicity, in the rest of the
paper, the cluster Lk is denoted by the subscript k, where
0 ≤ k ≤ t − 1.
The received signals at A and B during the BC phase are
respectively given by,

(4)

where XR = MHR (ˆA , xB ) ∈ S ′ is the complex vector
x ˆ
transmitted by R. The fading matrices of size nA × nR and
nB × nR corresponding to the R-A and R-B links are denoted
′
′
by HA and HB respectively and the additive noises ZA and
ZB are CN (0, σ 2 ).
In order to ensure that A (B) is able to decode B’s (A’s)
messages, the clustering C HR should satisfy the exclusive law
[3], i.e.,

Let dmin (HA , HB ) denote the minimum distance between
the points in the effective constellation SR (HA , HB ), i.e.,
dmin (HA , HB ) = min

2

From (2) it follows that d2 (HA , HB ) = 0 if HR is such
min
that hT ∆x = 0, ∀1 ≤ k ≤ nR , for some ∆x ∈ ∆S nA +nB .
k
Equivalently, for d2 (HA , HB ) = 0, the vectors hk , 1 ≤ k ≤
min
nR should belong to the vector subspace [span(∆x)]⊥ for
some ∆x ∈ ∆S nA +nB . In other words, the row space of HR
should be a subspace of the vector subspace [span(∆x)]⊥ , for
some ∆x ∈ ∆S nA +nB , for d2 (HA , HB ) to become zero.
min
The channel fade coefﬁcient matrix HR is said to be a deep
fade matrix, if dmin (HA , HB ) = 0. The row space of the
deep fade matrices are referred to as the deep fade spaces.
The deep fade spaces are subspaces of the vector subspaces
[span(∆x)]⊥ , ∆x ∈ ∆S nA +nB , which are referred to as the
singular fade subspaces. Let F denote the set of all singular
fade subspaces, i.e., F = {[span(∆x)]⊥ : ∆x ∈ ∆S nA +nB }.
Note that singular fade subspaces depend only on the set {∆x :
∆x ∈ ∆S nA +nB }, i.e., they are independent of nR .
Broadcast (BC) phase: Let (ˆA , xB ) ∈ S nA +nB denote the
x ˆ
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate of (xA , xB ) at R based
on the received complex vector YR , i.e.,

It is assumed that the complex numbers transmitted in each
one of the antennas at the end nodes belong to the signal set
S of size M = 2λ , where λ is an integer. Assume that A (B)
wants to transmit a λnA -bit (λnB -bit) binary tuple to B (A).
At node A (B), the λnA (λnB ) bits are spatially multiplexed
into nA (nB ) streams with each one of the streams consisting
of λ bits. The λ bits in each one of the streams are mapped
on to the signal set S using the map µ : Fλ → S and are
2
transmitted.
Multiple Access (MA) phase: Throughout, we assume
a block fading scenario with the Channel State Information (CSI) available only at the receivers. Let xA =
∈ S nA , x B =
[µ(sA (1)), µ(sA (2)), ..., µ(sA (nA ))]T
T
∈ S nB denote the
[µ(sB (1)), µ(sB (2)), ..., µ(sB (nB ))]
complex vectors transmitted by A and B respectively,
where sA (1), sA (2), ..., sA (nA ), sB (1), sB (2), ..., sB (nB ) ∈
Fλ . The received signal at R is given by YR = HA xA +
2
HB xB + ZR , where HA of size nR × nA and HB of size
nR × nB are the channel matrices associated with the A-R
and B-R links respectively. The additive noise vector ZR is
assumed to be CN (0, σ 2 InR ).

• For the n × n system, the singular fade subspaces which

identiﬁed and it is shown that ﬁnding the network coding maps which remove all the singular fade subspaces
reduces to ﬁnding a small set of maps. (Section III C).
• It is shown that most of the Latin Squares which remove
the singular fade subspaces for the n × n system, n ≥ 2,
are obtainable from Latin Squares of lower size (Section
IV).
The proofs of Lemmas and other claims are omitted due to
lack of space but are available in [8], with several illustrative
examples.

The minimum cluster distance determines the performance
during the MA phase of relaying. The performance during the
BC phase is determined by the minimum distance of the signal
set S ′ . For values of HR such that |hT ∆x| is small, ∀1 ≤
k
k ≤ nR , for some ∆x ∈ ∆S nA +nB , dmin (HR ) is greatly
reduced, a phenomenon referred as distance shortening. To
avoid distance shortening, for every singular fade subspace, a
clustering needs to be chosen such that the minimum cluster
distance at every HR whose rows belong to that singular fade
subspace is non-zero.
For a singular fade subspace f ∈ F, let dmin (C f , HR ) be

II. SINGULAR FADE SUBSPACES FOR 2λ -PSK
SIGNAL SET

,

The following lemma gives the total number of nonremovable and removable singular fade subspaces for 2λ -PSK
signal set.
Lemma 1: For M -PSK signal set (M any power of 2),
• The total number of non-removable singular fade subspaces is given by,

where Mf is the map associated with the clustering C f .
A clustering C f is said to remove a singular fade subspace
f ∈ F, if the minimum cluster distance dmin (C f , HR ) is
greater than zero, for every HR such that R(HR ) f .
It is important to note that certain singular fade subspaces
cannot be removed. These are precisely the singular fade
subspaces which are of the form [span(∆x)]⊥ , for which

and are referred to as the non-removable singular fade subspaces. The reason for this is as follows: The pair (xA , xB )
and (xA , x′ ) result in ∆x = [0TA ∆xT ]T . But (xA , xB ) and
n
B
B
(xA , x′ ) cannot be placed in the same cluster since exclusive
B
law will be violated.
Let CF = C f : f ∈ F denote the set of all clusterings,
which remove a removable singular fade subspace. For every
removable singular fade subspace, the set CF contains exactly
one clustering which removes that singular fade subspace.
For a given realization of HR , the clustering C HR
is chosen to be C f , which satisﬁes dmin (C f , HR ) ≥
′
dmin (C f , HR ), ∀f = f ′ ∈ F. The choice of C HR is indicated
by R to A and B using overhead bits.
The contributions and organization of this paper are as
follows.
• The structure and the exact number of non-removable and
removable singular fade subspaces for 2λ − P SK signal
set are obtained analytically (Section II).
• It is shown that the requirement of satisfying the exclusive
law is same as the clustering being represented by a
partially ﬁlled Latin Rectangle (PFLR) and can be used to
get the clustering which removes singular fade subspaces,
by completing the PFLR (Section III A).
• It is shown that the Latin Rectangles which remove the
singular fade subspaces for the case when end nodes
have unequal number of antennas, i.e., nA = nB can
be obtained from the Latin Squares which remove the
singular fade subspaces for the case when the nodes have

Example 1: Consider the MIMO two-way relaying system
with nA = 2 and nB = 2. From Lemma 1, the non-removable
singular fade subspaces for BPSK and QPSK signal sets are
respectively 4 and 28 in number. For BPSK and QPSK signal
sets, the total number of removable singular fade subspaces
are 32 and 1456 respectively. For examples of removable and
non-removable singular fade subspaces, see [8].
From Lemma 1, it can be seen that the number of nonremovable singular fade subspaces is O(M 2 max{nA ,nB }−1 ),
while the number of removable singular fade subspaces is
O(M 2(nA +nB )−1 ). Hence, the number of non-removable singular fade subspaces is a small fraction of the total number
of singular fade subspaces and the fraction tends to zero for
increasing values of M.

Rectangles and network coding maps satisfying the exclusive
law, for the MIMO two-way relaying scenario.

the nA × nB system, then [span([0TB −nA ∆xT ∆xT ]T )]⊥ is
n
A
B
a singular fade subspace for the nB × nB system. For a Latin
Square L of order n, let L[1:r,:] denote the Latin Rectangle
of order r × n obtained by taking only the ﬁrst r rows of L.
Lemma 2: For nB > nA , if the Latin Square L removes
[span([0TB −nA ∆xT ∆xT ]T )]⊥ for the nB × nB system, the
n
A
B
Latin Rectangle L[1:M nA ,:] removes [span([∆xT ∆xT ]T )]⊥

B
for the nA × nB system.
Example 3: The Latin Rectangle obtained by taking only
the ﬁrst two rows of the Latin Square in Fig. 2 which removes [span([0, −2, −2, 2]T )]⊥ for the 2 × 2 system, removes
[span([−2, −2, 2]T )]⊥ for the 1 × 2 system, with BPSK signal
set.
Since the Latin Rectangles for the nA × nB system are
obtainable from Latin Squares, in the rest of the paper it is
assumed that nA = nB = n.
C. Some Special Constructions of Latin Squares
Recall that the rows and columns of the Latin Squares are
indexed by vectors which belong to Zn . By bit-wise XOR
M
of two such vectors, it is meant to be the vector obtained by
taking the bit-wise XOR of the individual components of the
two vectors, after decimal to binary conversion. Every cell in
the Latin Square corresponding to the bit-wise XOR mapping
is ﬁlled with the decimal equivalent of the bit-wise XOR of
the row index and the column index.
Consider the set of singular fade subspaces
[span([∆xT ∆xT ]T )]⊥ , denoted by F± , which satisfy
A
B
the condition that ∆xA (i) = ±∆xB (i), ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Lemma 3: When the user nodes use 2λ -PSK constellations,
all the singular fade subspaces which belong to the set F± are
removed by bit-wise XOR mapping, for all λ.
Example 4: For the 2 × 2 system with BPSK signal set,
[span([2, −2, 2, 2]T )]⊥ ∈ F± and is removed by the bit-wise
XOR mapping given in Fig. 3.
Deﬁnition 2: A Latin Square LT is said to be the Transpose
of a Latin Square L, if LT (i, j) = L(j, i) for all i, j ∈
{0, 1, 2, .., M − 1}.
Lemma 4: If
the
Latin
Square
L
removes
[span([∆xT ∆xT )]T ]⊥ , then the Latin Square LT removes
A
B
[span([∆xT ∆xT )]T ]⊥ .
B
A
Deﬁnition 3: [7] Two Latin Squares L and L ′ (using the
same symbol set) are isotopic if there is a triple (f,g,h), where
f is a row permutation, g is a column permutation and h is
a symbol permutation, such that applying these permutations
on L gives L′ .
x
Consider a vector ∆˜ = [∆˜T ∆˜T ]T , where ∆˜A and
x
xA xB
∆˜B are obtained by the applying the permutations σA
x
and σB on the components of ∆xA and ∆xB respectively.
Equivalently this can be viewed as applying the permutations
σA and σB on the indices of the transmitting antennas at A
and B respectively. Hence, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 5: If a Latin Square L removes [span(∆x)]⊥ , the
isotopic Latin Square L′ obtained by applying the permutation
σA on the components of the row indices and the permutation
σB on the components of the column indices of L removes
[span(∆˜)]⊥ .
x

The bit-wise XOR map

Deﬁnition 4: [7] A Latin Rectangle L of order N1 × N2
on the symbols from the set Zt = {0, 1, · · · , t − 1} is an
N1 × N2 array, in which each cell contains one symbol and
each symbol occurs at most once in each row and column. A
Latin Rectangle of order N × N is called a Latin Square of
order N.
Let the points in the M -point signal set used for transmission at the nodes be indexed by the elements of the
set ZM = {0, 1, 2, . . . , M − 1}. Consider an M nA ×
M nB array at the relay with the rows (columns) indexed by the nA -tuple(nB -tuple) [xA (1), xA (2), . . . , xA (nA )]
([xB (1), xB (2), . . . , xB (nB )]) denoting the complex vector
transmitted by node A (B). Our aim is to form clusters from
the slots in the M nA × M nB array such that the exclusive
law is satisﬁed. To do so, we will ﬁll in the slots in the array
with the elements of set Zt and the clusters are obtained by
taking all the row-column pairs (i, j), i ∈ ZnA , j ∈ ZnB such
M
M
that the entry in the (i, j)−th slot is the same symbol from Zt
for a cluster. Now, it is easy to see the following: For MIMO
two-way relaying, every relay clustering which satisﬁes the
exclusive law forms a Latin Rectangle and vice verse.

Consider a singular fade subspace f ∈ F. Let (k, l)(k ′ , l′ ) ∈
× ZnB be the pairs which result in ∆x such that
M
[span(∆x)]⊥ = f . If (k, l) and (k ′ , l′ ) are not clustered
together, the minimum cluster distance will be zero, for all HR
such that R(HR )
f. To avoid this, those pairs should be
in the same cluster. This requirement is termed as singularityremoval constraint. So, we need to obtain Latin Rectangles
which can remove singular fade subspaces and with minimum
value for t. Therefore, initially we will ﬁll the slots in the
M nA × M nB array such that for the slots corresponding to a
singularity-removal constraint the same element will be used to
ﬁll slots. This removes that particular singular fade subspace.
Such a partially ﬁlled Latin Rectangle is called a Constrained
Partial Latin Rectangle (CPLR). After this, to make this a
Latin Rectangle, we will try to ﬁll the other slots of the CPLR
with minimum number of symbols from Zt .
Example 2: Consider the 2 × 2 system with
BPSK signal set {±1} used at the end nodes. For
the singular fade subspace [span([0, −2, −2, 2]T )]⊥ ,
the
singularity
removal
constraints
are
{{([0 0] , [0 1]) , ([0 1] , [1 0])} , {([1 0] , [0 1]) , ([1 1] , [1 0])}} .
The ﬁlled Latin Square which removes this singular fade
subspace is shown in Fig. 2.

[span([∆xT ∆xT ]T )]⊥ is a singular fade subspace for

For 2λ -PSK signal set, consider two singular fade subspaces
x
[span(∆x)]⊥ and [span(∆¯)]⊥ which are such that the absolute values of the components of ∆x and ∆¯ are equal. Let
x
T
T
[φT φT ]T and [φ′ A φ′ B ]T be the vectors consisting of the
A B
phases of individual components of ∆x and ∆¯ respectively.

Let ∆φA = φA − φ′ and ∆φB = φB − φ′ . Also let

∆φA (i) = Ai and ∆φB (i) = Bi .

Lemma 6: For 2λ -PSK signal set, let L denote the
Latin Square which removes the singular fade subspace
[span(∆x)]⊥ . The Latin Square L′ which removes the singular
fade subspace [span(∆¯)]⊥ can be obtained from L as follows:
x
To the ith component of all the row indices of L add kAi
modulo M ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n and to the ith component of all the
column indices of L add kBi modulo M ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n, to
obtain the Latin Square L′ .
The usefulness of Lemmas 4-6 is that the set of all Latin
Squares which remove all the singular fade subspaces can be
obtained from a small set of Latin Squares, as illustrated for
the 2 × 2 system in [8].

bit-wise XOR network code is used at R, irrespective of the
channel conditions.

The additive noises at the nodes are taken to be of unit
variance and energy of the signal set used at the nodes, which
is assumed to be equal, is deﬁned to be the Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR). Fig. 4 shows the SNR vs BER performance for
the proposed scheme and the pure XOR network code, for
the case when each one of the entries of the matrices HA ,

HB , HA and HB follow i.i.d. Rayleigh distribution, with unit
variance and also when each one of the entries of the matrices

HA , HB , HA and HB follow i.i.d. Rician distribution with a
Rician Factor of 10 dB and unit variances. From Fig. 4, it
can be seen that for the Rayleigh and Rician fading scenarios
considered, at a BER of 10−4 , the proposed scheme provides
a gain of 1.5 dB and 2.5 dB respectively over the pure XOR
network code.

IV. OBTAINING LATIN SQUARES FOR THE n × n
SYSTEM FROM LATIN SQUARES OF LOWER
ORDER
In this section, it is shown that most of the Latin Squares
which remove the singular fade subspaces of the n×n system,
n ≥ 2 are obtainable from the Latin Squares which remove
the singular fade subspaces of m × m system, where m < n.
Deﬁnition 4: For two vectors y and z of length 2a and
2b respectively, the compound vector of y and z, denoted
as comp(y, z) is the vector of length 2a + 2b given by
T

[y[1:a] z[1:b] y[a+1:2a] z[b+1:2b] ]T .

For a Latin Square L, let L[i:j,k:l] denote the (j − i + 1) ×
(l − k + 1) array obtained by taking only the ith to j th rows
and k th to lth columns of L. Let L+c denote the Latin Square
obtained by adding integer c to all the cells of L. Let max{L}
denote the maximum among all the integers ﬁlled in the cells
of the Latin Square L.
Deﬁnition 5: The Cartesian product of the two Latin
Squares L1 of order M a and L2 of order M b , denoted as
(L1 ⊗ L2 ), is the Latin Square of order M a+b for which

[span(comp(∆x1 , k∆x2 ))]⊥ , k ∈ C, for the (a + b) × (a + b)
system.
