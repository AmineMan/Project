Abstract—The causal cognitive interference channel (CCIC)
is a four-node channel, in which the second sender obtains
information from the ﬁrst sender causally and assists in the transmission of both. We propose a new coding scheme called HanKobayashi partial decode-forward binning (HK-PDF-binning),
which combines the ideas of Han-Kobayashi coding, partial
decode-forward relaying, conditional Gelfand-Pinsker binning
and relaxed joint decoding. The second sender decodes a part
of the message from the ﬁrst sender, then uses Gelfand-Pinsker
binning to bin against the decoded codeword. When applied to
the Gaussian channel, this HK-PDF-binning essentializes to a
correlation between the transmit signal and the state, which
encompasses the traditional dirty-paper-coding binning as a
special case when this correlation factor is zero. The proposed
scheme encompasses the Han-Kobayashi rate region and achieves
both partial decode-forward relaying rate for the ﬁrst user and
interference-free rate for the second user.

The full-duplex causal cognitive interference channel.

This scheme therefore brings a new way of coding and can be
combined with existing schemes for the IC-SC to improve
rates further. We then apply our scheme to the Gaussian
channel and show that introducing a correlation between the
state and the transmit signal can enlarge the rate region by
allowing both state nullifying and forwarding at the cognitive
user.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The causal Cognitive Interference Channel (CCIC) is a
practically-oriented cognitive channel, in which the second
(cognitive) sender obtains information from the ﬁrst (primary)
sender causally, then uses that to assist the transmissions of
the ﬁrst sender and its own message. This is different from
the traditional cognitive channel in which the cognitive user
knows the primary user’s message non-causally.
Coding for the traditional (non-causal) CIC is mainly based
on combining Gelfand-Pinsker binning technique [1] with
Han-Kobayashi coding [2], [3] for the interference channel.
Since the cognitive user has the primary user’s message noncausally, the fact that it relays this message is implicit. In the
causal-CIC, however, the cognitive user has to relay explicitly.
Speciﬁcally in this paper, we apply partial decode-forward
relaying [4], in which the cognitive user ﬁrst decodes the
primary user’s message causally, then transmits the decoded
message and its own message cognitively.
The CCIC can also be considered as a special case of the
interference channel with source cooperation (IC-SC) in which
both senders exchange information. Several coding schemes
have been proposed for the IC-SC by applying different ways
of rate splitting, block Markov encoding and/or GelfandPinsker binning [5]–[8]. These existing schemes may encompass the Han-Kobayashi rate region or the partial decodeforward (PDF) relaying rate, but none achieve both.
In this paper, we propose a new coding scheme for the CCIC
based on block Markov encoding, partial decode-forward
relaying, Gelfand-Pinsker binning and Han-Kobayashi coding
by splitting the ﬁrst user’s message into 3 parts and the second
user’s into 2 parts. The proposed scheme achieves both the
Han-Kobayashi region and the PDF rate for the primary user.

II. CCIC C HANNEL M ODELS
A. Full-duplex DM-CCIC model
The full-duplex causal cognitive interference channel consists of two input alphabets X1 , X2 , and three output alphabets
Y1 , Y2 , Y. The channel is characterized by a channel transition probability p(y1 , y2 , y|x1 , x2 ), where x1 and x2 are the
transmit signals of S1 and S2 , y1 , y2 and y are the received
signals of D1 , D2 and S2 . Figure 1 illustrates the channel
model, where W1 and W2 are the messages of S1 and S2 .
A (2nR1 , 2nR2 , n) code consists of the following:
nR1
• Two message sets W1 × W2 = [1, 2
] × [1, 2nR2 ] with
uniform, independent messages W1 , W2 , respectively.
• Two encoders: one maps message w1 into codeword
n
xn (w1 ) ∈ X1 , and one maps w2 and each received
1
k−1
sequence y
into a symbol x2k (w2 , y k−1 ) ∈ X2 .
n
n
• Two decoders: one maps y1 into w1 ∈ W1 ; one maps y2

into w2 ∈ W2 .
ˆ
The deﬁnitions for the error probability, achievable rates and
capacity region follow the standard ones in [9].
B. Full-duplex Gaussian CCIC model
The standard full-duplex Gaussian causal cognitive interference channel is shown in Figure 2 as
Y1 = X1 + bX2 + Z1 ,
Y2 = aX1 + X2 + Z2 ,
Y = cX1 + Z,

where Z1 , Z2 , Z ∼ N (0, 1) are independent Gaussian noises,

III. PARTIAL DECODE - FORWARD BINNING SCHEME
A. Han-Kobayashi PDF-binning scheme
Figure 3 illustrates the idea of the full-duplex HanKobayashi PDF-binning scheme. Message w1 is split into three
parts: w10 , w11 , w12 , corresponding to the common (forwarding), public and private parts, and message w2 is split into
two parts: w21 , w22 , corresponding to the public and private
parts. Take the transmission in block i as an example. At
S1 , the current common message w10i is superimposed on
the previous commons message w10[i−1] ; message w11i is
encoded independently of both w10[i−1] and w10i ; message
w12i is then superimposed on all three messages w10[i−1] ,
w10i and w10i . S2 decodes w10[i−1] of the previous block
˜
and uses conditional binning to bin the codeword for its
private part w22[i] against w10[i−1] , conditionally on knowing
˜
the public part w21[i] . At the end of block i, D1 uses joint
decoding over two consecutive blocks to decode a unique
tuple (w10[i−1] , w11[i−1] , w12[i−1] ) for some w21[i−1] without
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
requiring this message part to be correct. D2 treats the
codeword for w10[i−1] as the state and searches for a unique
pair (w21i , w22i ) for some w11i .

Applying standard error analysis and Fourier Motzkin elimination, we obtain rate region (2). For details see [11].
Remark 1. Even though at S2 we use standard Gelfand-Pinsker
binning technique, but depending on the joint distribution
between the binning auxiliary random variable (U22 ) and the
state (T10 ), S2 can also forward a part of the state (i.e. message
w10 of the previous block) to D1 .
Remark 2. In the binning step (5) at S2 , we use conditional
binning instead of unconditional binning. The binning is only
between the codeword for Han-Kobayashi private message part
U22 (w22 ) and the state T10 (w10 ), conditionally on knowing
the Han-Kobayashi public messsage part w21 . This conditional
binning is possible since w21 is decoded at both destinations.
Remark 3. In the decoding step (7) at D2 , we use joint decoding of both the Gelfand-Pinsker auxiliary random variable
(u22 ) and the Han-Kobayashi public message parts (w11 and
w21 ), instead of decoding Gelfand-Pinsker and Han-Kobayashi
codewords separately. This joint decoding is possible since the
n
n
codewords for w11 and w21 (i.e. U11 and U21 ) are independent
n
of the state in Gelfand-Pinsker coding (i.e. T10 ). Joint decoding
at both D1 (6) and D2 (7) help achieve the largest rate region
for this coding structure.
Remark 4. Inclusion of Han-Kobayashi rate region and the
maximum rate for each user
• The HK-PDF-binning scheme becomes the HanKobayashi scheme if T10 = U10 = ∅ and X2 = U22 .
• S1 achieves the partial decode-forward relaying rate if
we set U11 = U21 = U22 = ∅, and X2 = T10 .

The interference channel with source cooperation (IC-SC)
is a 4-node channel in which both S1 and S2 can receive
signal from each other and use that cooperatively in sending
messages to D1 and D2 . This channel therefore includes the
CCIC as a special case (when S2 sends no information to S1 ).
1) Host-Madsen’s scheme [5]: This scheme for Gaussian
IC-SC is based on dirty paper coding and block Markov encoding; it includes the rate for decode-forward relaying but not
the Han-Kobayashi region. However, since both senders must
decode the cooperative message from the other sender in order
to apply dirty paper coding, the scheme cannot be applied to
the CCIC which has only uni-directional cooperation.
2) Prabhakaran-Viswanath’s scheme [6]: This scheme is
based on 4-part rate splitting and block Markov superposition
coding. It may not contain the Han-Kobayashi region or the
PDF rate, depending on channel parameters. The ideas in this
scheme, however, can be combined with our scheme to further
improve the rate region.
3) Cao-Chen’s scheme [7]: This scheme is quite close to
our proposed scheme. It is also based on 3-part message
splitting, block Markov encoding, Gelfand-Pinkser binning
and random binning, and achieves the Han-Kobayashi region.
But this scheme cannot achieve the decode-forward relaying
rate because of no block Markovity between the current
and the previous cooperative messages, hence no coherent
transmission between source and relay.
4) Yang-Tuninetti’s scheme [8]: This scheme combines
ideas in previous schemes by doing 4-part message splitting,
block Markov superposition coding, Marton double binning
and Gelfand-Pinsker binning. It achieves the Han-Kobayashi
region but not the partial decode-forward relaying rate as in
(8). In this scheme, destination 2 decodes the cooperativecommon part of user 1, thus limits rate R1 to be below the
decode-forward relaying rate. In our proposed scheme, the
forwarding part of user 1 is not decoded at destination 2. (In
[8], it is claimed to achieve the partial decode-forward relaying
rate but only by setting Y1 = Y2 , which is not necessary in
our scheme for the CCIC.)
Furthermore, in both [7] and [8], joint decoding of both
the state and the binning auxiliary variables is used at the
destinations, but this joint decoding is invalid as it results in
a rate region larger than is possible. In our proposed scheme,
all message parts that are jointly decoded with the binning
auxiliary variable are encoded independently of the state.
Hence none of the existing schemes for the IC-SC include
both the HK rate region and the decode-forward relaying
rate as our proposed scheme (see Remark 4). More detailed
analysis can be found in [11].

An important feature of the signaling design in (10) is ρ
(−1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1), the correlation factor between the transmit
signal (X2 ) and the state (S10 ) at S2 . In traditional dirty paper
coding, the transmit signal and the state are independent. Here,
we introduce correlation between them, which includes dirty
paper coding as a special case when ρ = 0. This correlation
allows both signal forwarding and traditional binning at the
same time. λ is the partial decode-forward binning parameter
which will be optimized later.

the Han-Kobayashi region and partial decode-forward relaying
rate. Thus cognitive communication is also beneﬁcial even in
causal setting.

Proof: λ∗ is obtained by maximizing I11 in (2). The
detailed proof is omitted and can be seen in [11].
Remark 6. Effect of ρ:
∗
• If ρ = 0, λ becomes the optimal λ for traditional dirty
max
paper coding [12], which achieves R2 as in (14).
∗
• If ρ = ±1, λ differs from the λ in traditional dirty paper
max
coding and achieves R1 as in (13).
• The effect of ρ is shown in Figure 4. The dashed line
represents the rate region for DPC-binning (ρ = 0), while
the solid line represents the region for HK-PDF-binning
when we adapt ρ ∈ [−1, 1]. Figure 4 illustrates that the
correlation factor ρ can enlarge the rate region.

C. Numerical examples
In this section, we provide numerical comparison among
the proposed HK-PDF-binning scheme, the original HanKobayashi scheme, and an outer bound combining the capacity
for the (non-causal) CIC [13], [14] and the outer bound for
the IC with user cooperation (IC-UC) [15]. Figure 5 shows
an example for weak interference and Figure 6 for strong
interference. We can see that the proposed HK-PDF-binning
scheme contains the Han-Kobayashi region, partial decodeforward relaying rate for user 1 as in (13) and interference-free
rate for user 2 as in (14). The outer bound is the intersection
of the two bounds drawn and is loose as this bound is not
achievable. However, we observe that as b decreases, the HKPDF-binning rate region becomes closer to the outer bound.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a new coding scheme for
the full-duplex causal cognitive interference channel based
on partial decode-forward relaying, Gelfand-Pinsker binning
and Han-Kobayashi coding. For the Gaussian channel, we
introduce a correlation between the transmit signal and the
state, which enlarges the rate region by allowing both state
nullifying and forwarding. We also derive the optimal binning
