in the network. For instance, the message intended for Rx 1 ,
can be sent either through the direct link Tx 1 → Rx1 , or the
cyclic path Tx 1 → Rx2 → Tx2 → Rx1 . In particular, the
advantage of such artiﬁcial paths can be clearly understood
when the cross links are much stronger than the direct links
(e.g., the strong interference regime).
A similar improvement would be expected in any network
with such artiﬁcial cyclic paths. A natural generalization of
[3] is the K-user interference channel, in which each transmit
signal is corrupted by all the other signals transmitted by
other transmitters. This model is appropriate for a network
with densely located nodes, in which every receiver suffers
interference from every transmitter. Fig. 1 shows the fully
connected K-user interference channel (FC-IC) with feedback
for K = 3 users. In this paper, we study the FC-IC network
with feedback, and for simplicity, we consider a symmetric
network topology, in which all the direct links (from each
transmitter to its respective receiver) have the same gain, and
similarly, the gain of all cross (interfering) links are identical.
The number of symmetric generalized degrees of freedom
for the K-user FC-IC (without feedback) is characterized by
Jafar and Vishwanath in [5]. In this work, we study the impact
of feedback on the K-user FC-IC, and determine the GDoF
for this case. The main contribution of this paper is to show
that feedback can arbitrarily improve the performance of the
network. In particular, except for the intermediate interference
regime where SNR = INR, the effect of interference from
K − 1 users is as if there were only one interfering transmitter
in the network. This is analogous to the result of [6], where
it is shown that the number of per-user degrees of freedom of
the K-user fading interference channel is the same as if there
were only 2 users in the network.
Beside characterizing the asymptotic behavior of the capacity, the number of GDoF also tells us whether an interference
management techniques is (asymptotically) optimal for a certain regime of SNR and INR. In order to get the maximal
beneﬁt of feedback, we propose a novel coding scheme,
called cooperative interference alignment, which combines
two well-known interference management techniques, namely,
interference alignment and interference decoding. More precisely, the encoding at the transmitters is such that all the
interfering signals are aligned at each receiver. Unlike the
standard interference alignment approach in which the aligned
interference is usually suppressed, we need to decode aligned
interference to be able to remove it from the received signal.

Abstract—The symmetric K user interference channel with
fully connected topology is considered, in which (a) each receiver
suffers interference from all other K − 1 transmitters, and (b)
each transmitter has causal and noiseless feedback from its
respective receiver. The number of generalized degrees of freedom
(GDoF) is characterized in terms of α, where the interference-tonoise ratio (INR) is given by INR = SNRα . It is shown that the
number of per-user GDoF of this network is the same as that of
the 2-user interference channel with feedback, except for α = 1,
for which existence of feedback does not help in terms of GDoF.
The coding scheme proposed for this network, termed cooperative
interference alignment, is based on two key ingredients, namely,
interference alignment and interference decoding.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Wireless networks with multiple pairs of transceivers are
quite common in modern communications. The broadcast
and superposition nature of the wireless medium introduces
complex signal interactions between multiple competing ﬂows.
Managing such interfering signals is a long standing and fundamental problem in multiple ﬂow wireless communication.
The 2-user interference channel [1] is perhaps the simplest
example of a multiple ﬂow network. While the exact capacity
regions of networks is still unknown except for very speciﬁc
network topologies, much broader progress has been made
in ﬁnding approximate solutions [2], [3]. A closely related
notion is the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) which
determines the asymptotic behavior of the capacity region
with respect to growth of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
interference-to-noise ratio (INR) in various regimes.
It is well known that feedback does not increase the capacity of point-to-point discrete memoryless channels. However, feedback can be beneﬁcial in improving the capacity
regions of more complex networks. The effects of feedback
on the capacity region of the interference channel have been
studied in several papers (e.g., [4]). Suh and Tse in [3] have
provided an approximate feedback capacity region of the 2
user Gaussian interference. Perhaps, the most interesting part
of the result of [3] is the multiplicative gain provided by
feedback at high SNR. The gap between the capacity of the
channel with and without feedback can be arbitrarily large
for certain channel parameters. The key technique here is to
use the feedback links to create an artiﬁcial path from each
transmitter to its respective receiver through the other nodes

Consider a network with K pairs of transmitter/receivers.
Each transmitter Txk has a message Wk that it wishes to send
to its respective receiver Rx k . The signal transmitted by each
transmitter is corrupted by the interfering signals sent by other
transmitters and Gaussian noise, and received at the receiver.
This can be mathematically modelled as
√
√
Yk (t) = SNRXk (t) +
INRXi (t) + Zk (t), (1)

Our goal is to characterize the generalized degrees of freedom
of the K-user interference channel with output feedback. The
following theorem states the main result of this paper.
Theorem 1: For the K-user FC-IC with output feedback,
the number of per-user GDoF is given by

where Xk and Yk are the signals transmitted and received by
Txk and Rxk , respectively; Zk ∼ N (0, 1) is an additive white
Gaussian noise. All transmission powers are constrained to 1,
2
i.e., E[Xk ] ≤ 1, for k = 1, . . . , K. We assume a symmetric
network, where all the cross links have the same gain (INR),
and the gains of the all the direct links (SNR) are identical.
There is a perfect feedback link from each receiver to
its respective transmitter. Hence, at each time instance, each
transmitter generates its transmission signal based on its own
message as well as the output sequence observed at its receiver
over the past time instances, i.e.,

In order to demonstrate the beneﬁt gained by availability of
output feedback, we present the following theorem from [5],
which characterizes the GDoF for the FC-IC without feedback.
Theorem 2 ( [5], Theorem 3.1): The number of per-user
GDoF for the K-user FC-IC without feedback is given by

Xk (t) = fkt (Wk , Yk (1), . . . , Yk (t − 1)) = fkt (Wk , Ykt−1 ),

where Ykt−1 = (Yk (1), Yk (2), . . . , Yk (t − 1)) indicates the
channel outputs observed at Rx k up to time t − 1.
A rate tuple (R1 , R2 , . . . , RK ) is called achievable if there
exists a family of codebooks with corresponding rates whose
average decoding error probability vanishes as the block length
grows. We denote the set of all achievable rate tuples by R.
In the high SNR regime, the performance of wireless
networks is measured in terms of the number of degrees of
freedom, that is the pre-log factor in the expression of the
capacity in terms of SNR. We consider the GDoF for this
network in the presence of feedback. Since the problem is
parametrized in terms of two growing factors, namely SNR
and INR, we use the standard parameter α (as in [2] and [5])
to capture the growth rate of INR in terms of SNR. More
formally, we deﬁne
log INR

log SNR

The generalized degrees of freedom of the K-user interference channel with/without feedback are illustrated in Fig. 2. As
derived in [5], the number of GDoF for the K-user no feedback
case is similar to that of 2-user case [2], except for α = 1.
Similarly, here we show that in presence of feedback, the
number of GDoF for the K-user case is the same as that of the
2-user channel [3], except for α = 1. At this particular point,
the whole K by K network behaves as a singular network, and
the available GDoF = 1 has to be shared between K users.
III. A T RANSMISSION S CHEME
The encoding scheme we propose for this problem bears
some similarity to that of the 2-user case. It is shown in [3] that
for the 2-user feedback interference channel, depending on the
interference regime (value of α), it is (approximately) optimum
to decode the interfering message. Due to existence of the

(2)

2

feedback, decoding the interference is not only useful for its
removal and consequent decoding of the desired message (akin
to the strong interference regime without feedback), but also
helps for decoding a part of the intended message that is
conveyed through the feedback path.
However, a fundamental difference here is that in the Kuser case, there are multiple interfering messages received at
each receiver. Decoding of all interfering messages would
dramatically decrease the maximum rate of the intended
message. Our approach to deal with this is to decode the total
interference received from all other users as a single message,
without resorting to resolving the individual components of
the interference. There are two key conditions to be fulﬁlled
that allow us to perform such decoding, namely, (i) interfering
signals should be aligned, and (ii) the summation of interfering
signals should belong to a codebook of proper size which
can be decoded at each receiver. Here, the ﬁrst condition is
satisﬁed since the network is symmetric. In order to satisfy
the second condition, we can use a common lattice code in
all transmitters, instead of random Gaussian codebooks. The
closedness of lattice codes under summation implies that the
total aligned interfering signal observed at each receiver is
still a codeword from the same codebook. This allows us to
perform decoding by searching over a single codebook, instead
of the Cartesian product of all codebooks. Due to the fact that
the aligned interference is decoded, we call this coding scheme
cooperative interference alignment.

Once the encoding process is performed, the signal transmitted by Tx k in the ﬁrst block (of length T ) is formed as 1
INR − 1

Therefore, the signal received at Rx k can be written as

Let Λc be a good quantization lattice [7] with σ (Λc ) =
1/K 2 and G(Λc ) ≈ 1/2πe, and Λf be a good lattice for
channel coding. Deﬁne Λ c = KΛc to be the scaled version
of Λc by the constant factor K. We construct a codebook
C = Λf ∩ Vc , where Vc is the Voronoi cell of the lattice Λ c .
We also construct the codebook C = Λf ∩ Vc . The following
properties are fairly standard in the context of lattice coding:
a) Lattice codes C and C can be used to reliably transmit up
to rates R = 1 log(SNR/K) and R = 1 log SNR over a
2

Gaussian channel modelled by Y = SNRX + Z with
E[Z 2 ] = 1.
b) For any set of codewords c 1 , . . . , cK ∈ C, the summation
c0 = c1 + · · · + cK is a codeword in C .
In the rest of this section, we study coding schemes for
weak and strong interference regimes, separately.

Next, the decoder uses c 0 to remove the interference i=k c0i

We consider three messages w k0 , wk1 , and wk2 , for transmitter Txk which will be conveyed to receiver Rx k over two
blocks. All sub-messages w ki with the same index i have the
same rate, which is denoted by R i , for i = 0, 1, 2. Encoding
of wk1 and wk2 is performed using the usual random Gaussian
codebooks with block length T and average power 1, which
results in codewords c k1 and ck2 .
In order to encode w k0 , we use the common lattice code C
deﬁned above. Let c k0 be the lattice codeword to which w k0
is mapped, and deﬁne c 0 = c10 + c20 + · · · + cK0 .

In this section we prove the converse part of Theorem 1.
To this end, we derive an upper bound on the sum-rate of
the network. The essence of this bound is that in the strong
interference regime, given all the messages except for two of
them, the output signal of any of the respective receivers is not
only sufﬁcient to decode its own message, but can be also used
to decode the other missing message. Similarly, in the weak
interference regime, although one receiver cannot completely
decode the message of the other transmitter, it receives enough
information to partially decode that message.
We ﬁrst deﬁne zit = zit − z2t for i = 3, 4, . . . , K and
˜
t = 1, . . . , T . Then, we can write

C. Strong Interference Regime (α > 1)
The coding scheme for the strong interference regime is
simpler than the last case. Each transmitter has a message w k ,
which is mapped to a codeword c k from a Gaussian codebook
of rate Rsym , and sent over the ﬁrst block. Upon receiving
yk1 from the feedback link, Tx k removes its own signal,
and resends the residual over the second block. At the end of
the second block, each receiver uses its two received signals
to remove the interference and decode its intended message.
Formally, having y k1 from the feedback link, Tx k sends

V. C ONCLUSION
We have characterized the GDoF for the symmetric K-user
fully-connected interference channel with output feedback, by
introducing a coding scheme based on alignment and decoding
of the interference. This result shows that, except for the
moderate regime (SNR = INR), the system performance is
as if there is only one source of interference in the network.

In order to bound the second term in (10) we can write

where (b) is due to the facts that the channels are memoryless
and the noise at time t is independent of all the signals and
noises in the past.
