and its exponent of leaked information

After his achievement, Hayashi[1] derived the exponent of
leaked information, however, he also assume that the perfect
uniform distribution is available because his method is based
on the quantum version of the channel resolvability. Further,
there is a possibility to improve his exponent because the
commutative case of his exponent is smaller than that by
Hayashi[11]. On the other hand, Hayashi and Matsumoto [13]
treated secure multiplex coding in the classical setting, which
requires the generalization of the channel resolvability to the
case when the uniform random number is not available.
In this paper, we treat quantum wiretap channel model when
the sender Alice cannot use the uniform random number.
Alternatively, we assume that she knows the concrete form
of the distribution of the auxiliary random number and the
R´ nyi entropy of oder 2 of the prepared auxiliary random
e
number, which can be regarded as the sacriﬁce information
rate. In the quantum wiretap channel model, two classicalquantum channels are given. One is the channel from Alice’s
classical information to Bob’s quantum state. The other is the
channel from Alice’s classical information to Eve’s quantum
state. In this model, we focus on the code given by random
coding method. Under this protocol, we give an upper bound
for leaking information with the quantum mutual information
criterion. This bound goes to zero exponentially when the
generated key rate is less than the capacity, and can be
regarded as the quantum version of Hayashi[11].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we prepare
quantum versions of information quantities. In Section III,
we treat a non-uniform extension of quantum channel resolvability, which is a strong tool for quantum wiretap channel
with an auxiliary non-uniform random number. In Section
IV, we proceed to the quantum wiretap channel model and
derive an exponent for leaked information, whose commutative
version coincides with that by Hayashi[11]. In Section V,
we give a proof for Lemma given in Section III. Due to the
page limitation, we omitted several related results, which are
available in the arxiv.org eprint with the same title [15].

Abstract—A usual code for quantum wiretap channel requires
an auxiliary random variable subject to the perfect uniform
distribution. However, it is difﬁcult to prepare such an auxiliary
random variable. We propose a code that requires only an
auxiliary random variable subject to a non-uniform distribution
instead of the perfect uniform distribution. Further, we evaluate
the exponential decreasing rate of leaked information.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Secure communication is one of important topics in quantum information. Quantum wiretap channel model is one of
most adequate formulations of this problem. In this model,
the normal sender Alice sends her message to the normal
receiver Bob and keeps its secrecy for the eavesdropper
Eve. The sender is assumed to be able to use an auxiliary
random variable subject to the perfect uniform distribution.
This assumption is usual in the quantum setting [5], [6] as
well as in the classical setting[4], [2], [8], [11]. However, it is
quite difﬁcult to prepare a perfect uniform random number in
a realistic setting. Hence, it is required to construct a code that
properly works with an auxiliary non-uniform random number.
Further, it is impossible to estimate the leaked information
with a ﬁnite-length code from the quantum wiretap channel
capacity, which is the asymptotic limit of securely transmitted
rate. Hence, from a practical viewpoint, we need to treat
the decreasing speed of leaked information rather than the
quantum wiretap channel capacity. For this purpose, it is usual
to focus on the exponential decreasing rate (exponent) of
leaked information with a given sacriﬁce information rate in
information theory.
In fact, Devetak [5] applied the random coding to the
quantum wiretap channel model. For the evaluation for leaked
information, he essentially used the quantum version of the
channel resolvability. The original classical version is invented by Han and Verd´ [12]. In the quantum version, we
u
approximate the given output state by the output mixture
state with as a small number of input states as possible.
However, the quantum version of the channel resolvability
treats the output approximation when the input distribution is
the perfect uniform distribution. Hence, his method does not
work when the perfect uniform distribution is not available.

II. I NFORMATION QUANTITIES
In order to treat leaked information in the quantum setting, we prepare several information quantities in a composite system Ha ⊗ HE , in which, Ha is a classical system
spanned by the basis {|a }. When the composite state is

1

ρ =
a P (a)|a a| ⊗ ρa , the correlation between A and
HE can be evaluated by the quantum version of the mutual
information
I(A : E|ρ) := D(ρ ρA ⊗ ρE )
D(ρ σ) := Tr ρ(log ρ − log σ).

Then, we have the following lemma:
Lemma 1: For s ∈ (0, 1], we obtain
A

v s e−sH1+s (A|P ) eψ(s|W,p)
, (8)
s
where v is the number of eigenvalues of WP X .
EΦ D(WP A ◦Φ−1 WP X ) ≤

IV. Q UANTUM WIRETAP CHANNEL IN A GENERAL

Then, we can deﬁne information quantities for a classicalquantum channel W : a → Wa from the classical system A to
the quantum system HE and a distribution p on A. Using the
state ρ[W, p] := a pa |a a| ⊗ Wa , we deﬁne the quantities
I(W, p) := D(ρ[W, p] ρ[W, p]A ⊗ ρ[W, p]E )

A. Non-asymptotic bounds
Next, we consider the quantum wiretap channel model, in
which the eavesdropper (wire-tapper), Eve and the authorized
receiver Bob receive information from the authorized sender
Alice. In this case, in order for Eve to have less information,
Alice chooses a suitable encoding. This problem is formulated
as follows. Let HB and HE be the quantum systems of Bob
and Eve, and X be the set of alphabets sent by Alice. Then,
the main quantum channel from Alice to Bob is described
B
by W B : x → Wx , and the wire-tapper quantum channel
E
from Alice to Eve is described by W E : x → Wx . That
E
B
is, Wx (Wx ) is Bob’s (Eve’s) density matrix on the system
HB (HE ). In this setting, Alice chooses M distributions
Q1 , . . . , QM on X , and she generates x ∈ X subject to
Qi when she wants to send the message i ∈ {1, . . . , M }.
B
In this case, Bob (Eve) receives the density matrix WQi :=
E
E
B
x Qi (x)Wx ). Bob prepares M x Qi (x)Wx (WQi :=
outcome POVM {D1 , . . . , DM } of HB . Therefore, the triplet
(M, {Q1 , . . . , QM }, {D1 , . . . , DM }) is called a code, and is
described by Φ. Its performance is given by the following three
quantities. The ﬁrst is the size M , which is denoted by |Φ|.
The second is the average error probability B (Φ):

(3)

ψ(s|W, p) := ψ(s|ρ[W, p] ρ[W, p]A ⊗ ρ[W, p]E ).

These quantities have other forms:

III. G ENERALIZATION OF CHANNEL RESOLVABILITY
In order to treat the quantum wiretap channel model, we
treat the quantum channel resolvability problem for a given
classical-quantum channel W from the classical system X
to the quantum system H, in which, the output quantum
state Wx on H is given for any element x ∈ X . In the
channel resolvability, we treat the approximation of the given
output state with the output average state of the auxiliary input
random variable when the auxiliary input random variable is
subject to the uniform distribution of the subset X0 of the
input system X of the given channel. That is, the purpose
is minimizing the cardinality of the input subset X0 when
1
x∈X0 |X0 | Wx approximates a given output state ρ.
Now, we generalize this problem so that the uniform distribution on X0 is not available. We assume that the auxiliary
random variable is subject to a given distribution P A on the
set A. Choosing a map f from A to X , we approximate a
given state ρ by a∈A P A (a)Wf (a) . In order to evaluate the
randomness of the distribution P A , we deﬁne R´ nyi entropy
e
of order 1 + s:
−1
H1+s (A|P A ) :=
log
P A (a)1+s .

and the third is Eve’s information regarding the transmitted

message. Using the channel WQ : i → WQi , we can describe
this quantity by the following two ways:
E
I(W E |Φ) := I(WQ , Pmix )
E
Imax (W E |Φ) := max I(WQ , p).

In fact, by using I(W E |Φ σ) =
i M D(WQi σ), the
E
quantity I(W |Φ) can be written by another way:

When we do not need to specify the random variable A, we
simplify it to H1+s (P A ).
Now, we apply the random coding to the alphabet X with
the probability distribution P X . The map Φ from A to X
is randomly chosen in the following way. For each a ∈ A,
Φ(a) is the random variable subject to the distribution P X
on X . For a = a ∈ A, Φ(a) is independent of Φ(a ). Then,
for a distribution P A on A, we can deﬁne the distribution
P A ◦ Φ−1 (x) on X .
For any input distribution p, we deﬁne Wp (y) :=
x p(x)Wx (y).

I(W E |Φ) = I(W E |Φ WΦ ),

The mutual information can be bounded as
I(W E |Φ) ≤ I(W E |Φ σ).

where WΦ :=
i |Φ| WQi . In the usual setting, the distribution Qi can be chosen to a uniform distribution. However,
sometimes, it is difﬁcult to prepare a perfect uniform distribution in a realistic setting. So, in the following, we make our
code with a non-uniform distribution Q.
Now, we make a code Φ(X) for the quantum wiretap
channel based on the random coding method for given integers
L and M . In the following, Alice is allowed to generate a
random number on {1, . . . , L} with the distribution Q. First,
we generate the random code Φ(X) with size LM , which
is described by the LM independent and identical random
variables X subject to the distribution p on X . That is, all
of {Φ(X)l,m } are independent and obeys the distribution p
on X . For integers l = 1, . . . , L and m = 1, . . . , M , As is
guaranteed in the previous paper [9], we choose the decoder
(POVM) Dl,m (X) of the code Φ(X) such that the ensemble
expectation of the average error probability concerning deB
coding the input message A is less than 4(M L)s eψ(−s|W ,p)
for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. The proof given in [9] is valid even if the
prior distribution for sent messages is not uniform. That is,
when the message (l, m) is sent with the probability Q(l) ,
M
the ensemble expectation of the average error probability
concerning decoding the input message A is bounded by
B
4(M L)s eψ(−s|W ,p) for 0 ≤ s ≤ 1. Using the code Φ(X) ,
Alice encodes her message m = 1, . . . , M in the following
way. When Alice sends her message m, she generates the
random number l subject to Q, and input the alphabet Φ(X)l,m
in the channel W B , W B . That is, Alice generates the alphabet subject to the distribution Q(X)m , which is deﬁned as
Q(X)m (x) := l Q(l)δΦ(X)l,m ,x , where

Corollary 1: Assume that a random variable subject to the
distribution Q on {1, . . . , L} is available. There exists a code
Φ for any integer M , and any probability distribution p on X
such that the code Φ only uses the distribution Q for mixing

Proof: Now, we prove Corollary 1 using code Φ given in
Theorem 1. When i is regarded as a random variable obeying
the uniform distribution, Markov inequality guarantees that
B
Tr WQi (I − Di ) ≥ 3 B (Φ) holds at most probability 1/3.
E
E
Similarly, D(WQi WΦ ) ≥ 3I(W E |Φ) holds at most probability 1/3. So, there exist at least M/3 elements i1 , . . . , iM/3

E
such that Tr WQi (I − Dil ) ≤ 3 B (Φ), D(WQi WΦ ) ≤

Finally, we consider what code is derived from the above

Therefore, the existence of a good code is guaranteed in the
following way. That is, we give the concrete performance of
a code whose existence is shown in the above random coding
method.
Theorem 1: Assume that a random variable subject to the
distribution Q on {1, . . . , L} is available. There exists a code
Φ for any integer M , and any probability distribution p on X
such that the code Φ only uses the distribution Q for mixing
the input alphabet and

Bob recovers information l and m by using the decoder
{Dl,m (X)}, and discards the information l. We denote the
code constructed here by Φ(X). Therefore, the above discussion in [9] yields that

B. Asymptotic analysis
In the following, we focus on the n-fold discrete memoryless channels of the channels W B and W E , which is written as
W B,(n) and W E,(n) . The n-independent and identical distribution pn of p satisﬁes the additive equation ψ(s|W B,(n) , pn ) =
nψ(s|W B , p). In this case, we assume that a random variable
subject to the distribution Qn on {1, . . . , Ln } is available.
Thus, there exists a code Φn for any integer Mn , and any
probability distribution p on X such that the code Φn only
uses the distribution Qn for mixing the input alphabet and

the rate maxp I(W B , p) − I(W E , p) can be asymptotically

Now, we focus on the exponential decreasing rates of our
upper bounds. we assume that H2 (Qn ) ≥ nR, which implies
that H1+s (Qn ) ≥ H2 (Qn ) ≥ nR for s ∈ [0, 1] In fact,
H2 (Qn ) can be regarded as the sacriﬁce information.
Then, we deﬁne two kinds of the decreasing rate under the
above code:

VI. C ONCLUSION

We have given a protocol for quantum wiretap channel
with an auxiliary random variable subject to a non-uniform
distribution. Then, when the distribution of the auxiliary
random variable is not the uniform distribution but is close
to the uniform distribution, we have derived an upper bound
for exponential decreasing rate of leaked information in the
quantum mutual information criterion.
