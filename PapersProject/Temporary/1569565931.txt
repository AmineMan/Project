Another challenge for operators of wireless networks is the
provision of sufﬁcient channel state information at transmitter
and receivers. In practical systems there is always uncertainty
in channel state information due to the nature of the wireless
medium. A reasonable model is to assume that the exact
channel realization is not known; rather, it is only known that
it belongs to a pre-speciﬁed set of channels. If this channel
remains ﬁxed during the whole transmission of a codeword,
this corresponds to the concept of compound channels [8, 9].
To date, there is only little work that incorporates both tasks:
information theoretic security in interaction with channel uncertainty. The compound wiretap channel is analyzed in [6, 7,
10]. The MIMO compound wiretap channel is studied in [11]
and the MIMO compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential
messages in [12].
In this paper we consider the compound broadcast channel
with conﬁdential messages where the sender transmits not only
a conﬁdential message to a legitimate receiver with strong
secrecy, but also an additional common message to both,
the legitimate and non-legitimate receiver. Thus, it is related
to [2] and extends it in two ways: ﬁrst, it takes channel
uncertainty into account and, second, it employs the strong
secrecy criterion.1

Abstract—In this paper the compound broadcast channel with
conﬁdential messages is studied, where it is only known to the
transmitter and receivers that the actual channel realization is
ﬁxed and from a pre-speciﬁed set of channels. An achievable
rate region for the strong secrecy criterion is derived. Further,
a multi-letter outer bound is given, which establishes, together
with the achievable rate region, a multi-letter expression of the
strong secrecy capacity region.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Operators of wireless networks are confronted with an
inherent problem: a transmitted signal is received by its
intended users but can also easily be eavesdropped by nonlegitimate receivers due to the open nature of the wireless
channel. To meet this challenge, current systems usually
apply cryptographic techniques to keep information secret.
These techniques are based on the assumption of insufﬁcient
computational capabilities of non-legitimate receivers, but
due to increasing computational power, recent advances in
number theory, and improved algorithms, these techniques are
becoming more and more insecure.
Information theoretic, or physical layer, security solely uses
the physical properties of the wireless channel to establish
a higher level of security. Thus, whatever transformation is
applied to the signals at the eavesdroppers, the original message cannot be reproduced with high probability. Information
theoretic security was initiated by Wyner, who introduced the
wiretap channel [1], and later generalized by Csisz´ r and
a
K¨ rner to the broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages
o
[2]. Recently, there is growing interest in information theoretic
security; for instance see [3, 4] and references therein.
However, usually the criterion of weak secrecy is applied,
which is heuristic in nature in that no operational meaning has
been given to it yet. This means that even if this criterion holds,
it is not clear what an eavesdropper can or cannot do to decode
the conﬁdential message. But recently, an operational meaning
has been given to the strong secrecy criterion introduced by
Maurer and Wolf [5]: it was established in [6, 7] for the
wiretap channel that the strong secrecy criterion implies that
the average decoding error at the eavesdropper tends to one
for any decoder it may use.

Let X , Y, and Z be ﬁnite input and output sets and
S = {1, ..., S} be an index set. Then for ﬁxed s ∈ S
and input and output sequences xn ∈ X n , y n ∈ Y n , and
z n ∈ Z n , the discrete memoryless broadcast channel is given
n
⊗n
by Ws (y n , z n |xn ) :=
i=1 Ws (yi , zi |xi ). We denote its
⊗n n n
⊗n
marginal channels by WY,s (y |x ) and WZ,s (z n |xn ).
Deﬁnition 1: The discrete memoryless compound broadcast channel W is given by W := {(WY,s , WZ,s ) : s ∈ S}.
We consider the standard model with a block code of
arbitrary but ﬁxed length n. Let M0 := {1, ..., M0,n } and
M1 := {1, ..., M1,n } be the sets of common and conﬁdential
messages. Further we use the abbreviation M := M0 × M1 .
1 Notation: Discrete random variables are denoted by non-italic capital
letters and their realizations and ranges by lower case and script letters, respectively; H(·) and I(·; ·) are the traditional entropy and mutual information;
X − Y − Z denotes a Markov chain of random variables X, Y, and Z in this
order; P(·) denotes the set of all probability distributions; E[·] and P{·} are
the expectation and probability.

Deﬁnition 2: An (n, M0,n , M1,n )-code for the compound
broadcast channel W with conﬁdential messages consists of a
stochastic encoder

with PA ⊗ PB (a, b) = PA (a)PB (b).
Proof: A proof can be found in [14, Lemma 1.2.7].
Thus, for I(M1 ; Zn ) to be small, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd for every

IV. ACHIEVABILITY
Here we prove Theorem 1, i.e., the achievability of (3)
with strong secrecy. Therefore, we construct a codebook
that enables reliable communication of all messages, while
ensuring the secrecy of the conﬁdential message. Additionally
to the key observation in (4), we need two ingredients.
The ﬁrst one ensures reliable communication of the common
message m0 to both receivers and of the conﬁdential message
m1 to receiver 1. Let us drop the security requirement on m1
for a moment, i.e., m1 need not be be kept secret from nonlegitimate receiver 2. Then this scenario corresponds to the
broadcast channel with degraded message sets [15].
Lemma 2: An achievable rate region for the compound
broadcast channel with degraded message sets is given by all
rate pairs (R0 , R1 ) ∈ R2 that satisfy
+

To ensure that the conﬁdential message is kept secret
from non-legitimate receiver 2 for all s ∈ S, we require
maxs∈S I(M1 ; Zn ) ≤ n for some (small) n > 0 with M1
s
the random variable uniformly distributed over the conﬁdential
message set M1 and Zn = (Z1 , Z2 , ..., Zn ) the output at
receiver 2. This criterion is known as strong secrecy [5].
Deﬁnition 3: A rate pair (R0 , R1 ) ∈ R2 is said to be
+
achievable for the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages if for any δ > 0 there is an n(δ) ∈ N and a
sequence of (n, M0,n , M1,n )-codes such that for all n ≥ n(δ)
1

we have n log M0,n ≥ R0 − δ, n log M1,n ≥ R1 − δ, and
max I(M1 ; Zn ) ≤
s
s∈S

n

while e1,n , e2,n , n → 0 as n → ∞. The closure of the set of
¯
¯
all achievable rate pairs is the strong secrecy capacity region of
the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages.
Theorem 1: An achievable strong secrecy rate region for
the compound broadcast channel with conﬁdential messages
is given by the set of all rate pairs (R0 , R1 ) ∈ R2 that satisfy
+
R0 ≤ min min I(U; Ys ), I(U; Zs )
R1 ≤ min I(V; Ys |U) − max I(V; Zs |U)

for random variables U−X−(Ys , Zs ) with average probability

Sketch of Proof: The region can be proved using random
coding arguments. More precisely, a superposition of codewords for the common message and for the private message
according to the chosen input distributions (6) and (7) will
allow to prove the result in a similar way as for example in
[16] for the compound bidirectional broadcast channel. The
details are omitted due to lack of space.
Remark 2: For |S| = 1 the region (5) reduces to a
subregion of [15]. More precisely, the sum constraint on
receiver 1 of the form R0 + R1 ≤ I(X; Ys ) in [15] is
replaced by individual constraints on R0 ≤ I(U; Ys ) and
R1 ≤ I(X; Ys |U) which makes the region smaller. However,
(5) will be sufﬁcient to establish the desired result in (3).
The second ingredient will be used to incorporate the strong
secrecy requirement on m1 . In more detail, we will exploit the
concentration of sums of i.i.d. random variables around their
expectation as given in the following lemma which is due to
Chernoff and Hoeffding [17].

Remark 1: Since receiver 2 is a legitimate receiver for
the common message and at the same time a non-legitimate
receiver for the conﬁdential message, we have made different
assumptions on its channel. Accordingly, we have to assume
the worst channel in (3a) for the common message and the
best channel in (3b) for the conﬁdential message.
III. K EY I DEA FOR S TRONG S ECRECY
In this paper we extend Devetak’s approach [13] introduced
for the wiretap channel to the compound broadcast channel
with conﬁdential messages. This approach establishes strong
secrecy using only the noisy channel. We start with a basic
observation concerning the relationship of total variation distance and mutual information.

After these preliminary considerations we come to the
coding part. For probability distribution PU ∈ P(U) and
n
δ > 0, let TU,δ be the set of δ-typical sequences on U n , cf.
for example [14]. We deﬁne

Ln ≥ 2n(maxs∈S I(X;Zs |U)+2(δ1 +δ2 )) .

Further, for the conﬁdential messages we set
M1,n ≤ 2n(mins∈S I(X;Ys |U)−maxs∈S I(X;Zs |U)−3(δ1 +δ2 )) .
From (12)-(13) we know that (11) is satisﬁed for every s ∈
S, (m0 , m1 ), and z n ∈ Z n with probability close to one.
Further, with M0,n , M1,n , Ln as deﬁned above it follows from
Lemma 2 that the random codewords we have chosen are the
codewords of a deterministic code achieving e1,n , e2,n ≤ 2−nγ
¯
¯
for some γ > 0 with probability close to one. Thus, there must
be realizations of (Un 0 , Xn 1 m0 ) and ϑs,Un 0 with both these
m
lm
m
properties, which we denote by (un 0 , xn 1 m0 ) and ϑs,m0 .
m
lm
From this we construct an appropriate code with a stochastic
encoder. Therefore, each message pair (m0 , m1 ) ∈ M0 × M1
is mapped into the codeword xn 1 m0 ∈ X n with probability
lm
1/Ln which deﬁnes a stochastic encoder. The decoder at
legitimate receiver 1 decodes all indices, i.e., (l, m1 , m0 ),
while the decoder at non-legitimate receiver 2 only decodes the
common message m0 . From Lemma 2 we know that this code
is suitable for reliable transmission of all messages to their
respective receivers. It remains to prove that (4) is satisﬁed.

This provides the basis for the proof of (4). Note that we have
to choose the maximum in (13) to ensure that (12) tends to
zero doubly-exponentially for all channel realizations s ∈ S.
Next, we determine the sizes of the remaining sets for the
conﬁdential message. For maxs ∈S I(X; Zs |U) < I(X; Ys |U)
for all s ∈ S, we choose δ (and therewith also δ1 and δ2 ) small
enough such that (13) is satisﬁed and at the same time

for some δ1 = δ1 (δ), see e.g. [14]. Now let

n

2 ln 2

for some δ2 = δ2 (δ), see e.g. [14], since Un 0 is δ-typical. Note

that if we choose n = 2−nβ for some β ≤ 4 min{γ, δ1 +δ2 },
then (12) tends to zero doubly-exponentially for

where the steps follow from the law of total probability, from
Lemma 3 and (9), and from (10) and

where for any set A ⊂ Z n , we let 1A (z n ) = 1 if z n ∈ A
and 1A (z n ) = 0 else. Conditional on Un 0 , these random
m
variables are i.i.d. Moreover, as the input (Xn 1 m0 , Un 0 ) is
m
lm
jointly δ-typical with respect to the joint distribution PXU , and
the outputs of Qn are δ-typical conditional on the inputs, it is
s
well known that (8) is bounded from above by

This allows us to deﬁne the random coding scheme as
follows. Let M0 be the set of common messages where its
size M0,n is determined by (5a), cf. Lemma 2. Let M1 be the
set of conﬁdential messages and further L := {1, ..., Ln } with
M1,n and Ln to be determined later. Let {Un 0 : m0 ∈ M0 }
m
be i.i.d. random variables with values in U n according to PUn ,
cf. (6). Then for each m0 ∈ M0 we deﬁne random variables
{Xn 1 m0 : (l, m1 ) ∈ L × M1 } with values in X n , which are
lm
i.i.d. conditional on Un 0 according to PXn |Un , cf. (7).
m
Now we come to the application of Lemma 3. We note that
the channel WZ,s can also be regarded as a channel with inputs
in U × X where the U-inputs do not make any difference.
Moreover, it will be sufﬁcient to concentrate only on those
outputs that are typical; the probability of all other outputs
will be of no consequence as we will see later. Therefore, we
deﬁne for every channel s ∈ S, message triple (l, m1 , m0 ),
and z n ∈ Z n the random variable

inputs is exponentially small, cf. for example [14].

which proves (4). Note that (14) becomes exponentially small
since we chose n = 2−nβ . Thus, the mutual information
between the conﬁdential message M1 and the corresponding
output Zn at the non-legitimate receiver is exponentially small

This proves the achievability of the desired rate region but
only for random variables U − X − (Ys , Zs ). To obtain the
whole region given in (3), note that the transmitter can preﬁx

Recall that the transition between the messages (M0 , M1 ) and
the input Xn is governed by a stochastic encoder, which allows
us to introduce arbitrary auxiliary random variables U and V

Remark 4: Applying the achievability result given in Theo⊗n

rem 1 to the channels WY,s and WZ,s yields the achievability
result for the corresponding multi-letter case. Together with
the converse result given in Theorem 2 we conclude on the
following.
