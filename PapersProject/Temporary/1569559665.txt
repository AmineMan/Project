most cases A is chosen to be a subset of ΘZK , where
Θ ∈ RK×K is a full-ranked matrix. For a complex matrix A, let vec(A) denote the complex vector obtained by
stacking the columns of A one below the other and let
vec(A) = [vec(ARe )T vec(AIm )T ]T . Now, the received matrix Y can be rewritten as y = vec(Y) = Gx + w, where
x = [x1 , . . . , xK ]T , w = vec(W) and the equivalent channel
matrix

Abstract—A Space-Time Block Code (STBC) is said to be
multigroup ML decodable if the information symbols encoded by it
can be partitioned into two or more groups, such that each group
of symbols can be ML decoded independently of the other symbol
groups. In this paper, we show that the upper triangular matrix
R encountered during the sphere decoding of a linear dispersion
STBC can be rank-deﬁcient even when the rate of the code is
less than the minimum of the number of transmit and receive
antennas. We then show that all known families of high rate
(rate greater than 1) multigroup ML decodable codes have rankdeﬁcient R matrix, even when the rate is less than the number of
transmit and receive antennas, and this rank-deﬁciency problem
arises only when the number of receive antennas is strictly less
than the number of transmit antennas. Unlike the codes with
full-rank R matrix, the average sphere decoding complexity of
the STBCs whose R matrix is rank-deﬁcient is polynomial in
the constellation size, and hence is high. We derive the sphere
decoding complexity of most of the known high rate multigroup
ML decodable codes, and show that for each code, the complexity
is a decreasing function of the number of receive antennas.

G = [vec(A1 H) vec(A2 H) · · · vec(AK H)] ∈ R2M T ×K .
Consider the vector of transformed information symbols
s = Θ−1 x which takes values from A = Θ−1 A ⊂ ZK . The
components of s take integer values and hence one can use a
sphere decoder to decode s and then obtain the ML estimate
of the information vector x. The ML decoder is given by
ˆ = arg mins∈A ||y − GΘs||2 .

B. Motivation for our results

I. I NTRODUCTION

For a system where rank(G) = K, the sphere decoding
complexity, averaged over noise and channel realizations, is
independent of the constellation size, and is roughly polynomial in the dimension of the sphere decoding search [11], [12].
However, if rank(G) = K < K, the average sphere decoding
complexity is no more independent of the constellation size. In
this case, the conventional sphere decoder is modiﬁed as follows [13]: the R matrix resulting from the QR-decomposition
of GΘ will be of the form R = [Ra Rb ] ∈ RK ×K , where Ra
is a K × K upper triangular, full-rank matrix. There is a
corresponding partition of s as [sT sT ]T . If q is the size of the
a b
regular PAM constellation used, then for each of the q K−K
values of the vector sb , the conditionally optimal estimate of sa
is found by ﬁrst removing the interference from sb , and then
using a sphere decoder with the upper triangular matrix Ra
to obtain the estimate ˆa (sb ). Then, from the resulting q K−K
s
tuples (ˆa (sb ), sb ), the optimal vector is chosen by the brutes
force enumeration of their ML metrics ||Y − HX||2 . Thus,
F
for any STBC whose equivalent channel matrix G is such that
rank(G) = K < K, the sphere decoding complexity is of the
order of q K−K .
It is claimed in [1] without proof that R ≤ min{M, N } is a
sufﬁcient condition for rank(G) = K. In Section II, we show
that the claim made in [1] is true only for M ≥ N , and there
exist codes with rank(G) < K when R ≤ min{M, N } and
M < N . This observation is the gateway to the new results

A. System Model
We consider Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) for an
N transmit antenna, M receive antenna, quasi-static MIMO
channel with Rayleigh ﬂat fading, Y = XH + W, where X is
the T × N codeword matrix and W is the additive noise at the
receiver. The entries of H and W are i.i.d. zero mean, complex
Gaussian random variables. The channel H is assumed to
be known at the receiver, but not at the transmitter. Let
C=

K
i=1

xi Ai [x1 , . . . , xK ]T ∈ A

be an STBC encoding

K real information symbols x1 , . . . , xK , where the T × N
complex matrices A1 , . . . , AK , which are called linear dispersion or weight matrices, are linearly independent over the
real ﬁeld R [1], [2], and the ﬁnite signal set A ⊂ RK . The
K
rate of C is R = 2T complex symbols per channel use (cspcu).
The linear independence of the weight matrices implies that
R ≤ N . The code C is said to be multigroup or g-group ML
decodable if {x1 , . . . , xK } can be partitioned into g subsets or
groups, such that each group of symbols can be ML decoded
independently of other symbol groups. Because such codes
offer reduced complexity ML decoding, they have gathered
much interest in the literature. Examples include [2]–[5] and
the references therein, and the more recent high rate (R > 1)
codes in [6]–[10].
Generally, the signal set A is chosen in such a way that
the STBC C has full-diversity and large coding gain. In

(Section III, see Table I).

denoted in bold, uppercase (lowercase) letters. For a complex
matrix A, its transpose and conjugate-transpose are denoted by
AT and AH , respectively. The n×n identity matrix is denoted
by In and 0 is the null matrix of appropriate dimension.

The proofs of all the propositions, theorems and other
claims are omitted due to space considerations, but are available in [14] along with several illustrative examples.

C. Contributions of the Paper
We now introduce the notion of singularity of an STBC
which is a direct indicator of its sphere decoding complexity
(note that since H is a random matrix, rank(G) is a random
variable as well).
Deﬁnition 1: Let C
be an STBC with rate
R ≤ min{M, N }. We say that C is singular for M receive
antennas if rank(G) < K with probability 1. Otherwise, C is
said to be non-singular for M receive antennas.
Example 1: In [6], a rate R = 17 code for N = 4 antennas
8
with K = 17 real symbols was presented. Let the number of
receive antennas be M = 3. Then, R < min{M, N } and the
equivalent channel matrix G is of size 24 × 17. Now consider
the following randomly generated channel matrix

We now present a few fundamental results on the rank of the
equivalent channel matrix. The following proposition says that
the rank-deﬁciency problem arises only in asymmetric MIMO
with M < N .
Proposition 1: If M ≥ N , every T × N STBC is nonsingular for M receive antennas.
Let A1 , A2 , . . . , AK denote the R-linear subspace of
CT ×N spanned by the matrices A1 , . . . , AK .
Proposition 2: Let B1 , . . . , BK be T ×N complex matrices
such that A1 , . . . , AK = B1 , . . . , BK and let H ∈ CN ×M
be any matrix. Then the column spaces of the matrices

The resulting G matrix has rank only 16 and the upper
triangular matrix R of size 24 × 17 obtained from its QRdecomposition is of the form [RT 0T ]T , where R1 ∈ R16×17
1
is shown in (1) at the top of the next page, and 0 is the 8 × 17
all zero matrix. The non-zero entries of R1 are denoted by ‘a’.
From (1), we see that the ﬁrst 16 columns of R are linearly
independent and the last column lies in the span of the ﬁrst
16 columns. After removing the last 8 rows of R, which are
all zeros, the sphere decoder uses the 16 × 17 real matrix
R1 to ﬁnd the ML estimate of the information vector. In this
case, the complexity of sphere decoding this STBC for this
particular channel realization H is of the order of q 17−16 = q.
In Section III-A, by establishing that rank(G) = 16 with
probability 1 when the randomness of H is taken into account,
we show that this STBC is singular for M = 3.
The contributions and organization of this paper are as
follows.
• We introduce the notion of singularity of an STBC which
is a direct indicator of its sphere decoding complexity.
• We show that R ≤ min{M, N } is not a sufﬁcient condition for an STBC to be non-singular for M receive antennas (Theorem 1, Section II). Thus, even when M ≥ R,
the matrix R need not be full-ranked. We also show that
the case of singular STBCs arises only for asymmetric
MIMO systems with M < N (Proposition 1, Section II).
• We show that all known families of high rate (R > 1)
multigroup ML decodable codes [6]–[10] are nonsingular for certain values of M (Section III, see Table I
for a summary of results).
• We derive the sphere decoding complexity of almost all
known high-rate multigroup ML decodable codes and
show that in each case the sphere decoding complexity is

GA (H) = [vec(A1 H) vec(A2 H) · · · vec(AK H)] and

(2)

GB (H) = [vec(B1 H) vec(B2 H) · · · vec(BK H)]

(3)

are identical. In particular, rank(GA (H)) = rank(GB (H)).
The following result shows that if every weight matrix of a
given STBC is multiplied on the left by a constant invertible
matrix, then the rank of the equivalent channel matrix is
unchanged.
Proposition 3: Let C ∈ CT ×T be any full-rank matrix,
Bi = CAi , i = 1, . . . , K, and H be any N × M complex
matrix. Then we have rank(GA (H)) = rank(GB (H)), where
GA (H) and GB (H) are as deﬁned in (2) and (3).
It is shown in [10] that for any N ≥ 1, there exists
an explicitly constructable set of N 2 matrices belonging to
CN ×N that are unitary, Hermitian and linearly independent
over R. This set of matrices forms a basis for the space of
Herm
N × N Hermitian matrices. Denote by CN
any STBC
2
obtained by using these N matrices as weight matrices. For
positive integers n and m, deﬁne the function
f (n, m) = n2 − ((n − m)+ )2 ,
where (a)+ = max{a, 0}. We now state the main result of
this paper.
Theorem 1: The equivalent channel matrix of the STBC
Herm
CN
for M receive antennas has rank f (N, M ) with
probability 1.

1 Throughout this paper, by sphere decoding complexity we mean the
average sphere decoding complexity, and the focus is on the dependence of
the complexity on the constellation size q.

The sphere decoder uses the 8 × 9 matrix R obtained from
R by deleting its last 4 rows which are all zero. Hence,
for this particular channel realization H, the sphere decoding
complexity is of the order of q 9−8 = q.
Suppose the code obtained from an STBC C with a signal set A is g-group ML decodable for some g > 1. The
information symbols {x1 , . . . , xK } can be partitioned into g
vectors xI1 , . . . , xIg of length λ1 , . . . , λg respectively such
that each symbol vector can be ML decoded independently
of other symbol vectors. There is a corresponding partition of
the channel matrix into g submatrices G1 , . . . , Gg , such that

xI2 = [x2 , . . . , x17 ]T , λ2 = 16 and G = [G1 G2 ]. The
weight matrix corresponding to x1 is I4 . Since any two weight

for all the matrices in G2 , V2 is constant, denoted by F2 . Each
group contains n2 + 1 real symbols.
We will now derive the rank of the submatrix G1
of G that corresponds to G1 = {A1 , . . . , An2 +1 }. Consider the set G1 = {Ai = CAi , i = 1, . . . , n2 + 1}, where
C = diag(In , iFH ). Since C is unitary, from Proposition 3,
2
the rank of G1 equals the rank of G1 , the equivalent channel
matrix corresponding to G1 . Since the multiplication of all the
weight matrices of an STBC by a unitary matrix does not affect
its multigroup ML decodability, for every matrix B ∈ G2 , CB
is Hurwitz-Radon orthogonal to Aj , j = 1, . . . , n2 + 1, where
Aj and CB are block diagonal and are of the form

all the matrices in the second group are skew-Hermitian, i.e.,
AH = −Ai , i = 2, · · · , 17. As a result, we can express
i
these weight matrices as Ai = iI4 .Ai , i = 2, · · · , 17, with
A1 , . . . , A17 being Hermitian matrices. It is clear that for any
channel realization H, G1 = [vec(H)], which is non-zero with
probability 1. Hence, rank(G1 ) = 1 with probability 1. From
Proposition 3 and Theorem 1, rank(G2 ) = f (4, M ) with
probability 1. So,
1) For M = 3, rank(G2 ) = 15. Since xI1 and xI2 can
be decoded independently of each other, the sphere
decoding complexity of the ﬁrst group is independent of
q while that of the second group is O(q (16−15) ) = O(q).
Consequently, the sphere decoding complexity of the
code in [6] is O(q) for 3 receive antennas.
2) For M ≥ 4, f (4, M ) = 16, hence the STBC in [6]
is non-singular, and its sphere decoding complexity is
independent of q.

and from Proposition 3 has the same dimension as that
of A1 , . . . , An2 +1 over R, which is equal to n2 + 1. The
ﬁrst matrix in (5) is linearly independent of the remaining
matrices and hence the dimension of the span of the remaining matrices in (5) is n2 . Without loss of generality,
let us assume that D1 , . . . , Dn2 are linearly independent, thus
D1 , . . . , Dn2 is the space of all n × n Hermitian matrices.
Then, A1 , . . . , An2 +1 equals the space spanned by

decreasing function of the number of receive antennas M .

IV. C ONCLUSION
In this paper we have shown that even when the rate
R ≤ min{M, N }, the R matrix arising during the sphere
decoding of an STBC can be rank deﬁcient, and that this rankdeﬁciency arises only in the case of asymmetric MIMO with
M < N . Since the sphere decoding complexity decreases with
increase in rank(R), for systems with M < N , the weight
matrices must be constructed intelligently, so that the resulting
code has an R matrix with a large rank.

in [10], non-delay optimal codes with T = gN , N = n2
,

n ≥ 1, and rate R = 2g−1 + g−1 were constructed. The sphere
2N
decoding complexity of these codes for even values of g is of

non-zero and hence the ﬁrst matrix is linearly independent of
the remaining matrices. From Theorem 1 and Proposition 2,
the dimension of the span of the remaining n2 matrices
is f (n, M ) = n2 − ((n − M )+ )2 with probability 1. Thus
rank(G1 ) equals f (n, M ) + 1 with probability 1.
Similarly we can show that rank(G2 ) = f (n, M ) + 1
with probability 1 as well. From Proposition 4,
rank(G) = rank(G1 ) + rank(G2 )

equals

C. Codes from Ren et. al. [8]
In [8], 2-group ML decodable codes for all N ≥ 1 and all
2
even T ≥ 2N were constructed with rate R = N − N T−1 .
The number of symbols per group is K = T N − N 2 + 1.
2
The codes of this family are singular for all R ≤ M < N
receive antennas, and their sphere decoding complexity is
+
O q (N −M ) ·(T −N −M ) . From Proposition 1, it is clear that
these codes are non-singular if and only if M ≥ N .
Example 3: Consider the STBC from [8] for N = 4 and
T = 2N = 8. The rate of this code is R = 17 and the number
8
of symbols per decoding group is K = 17. From the above
2
discussion it is clear that this STBC is singular for M = 3. The
rank of the equivalent channel matrix of each ML decoding
group equals 16 with probability 1 and hence the sphere
decoding complexity is O(q).
It is interesting to compare this code with the code from [6]
which was discussed in Section III-A and Example 1, when
the number of receive antennas is M = 3. Both codes have
the same parameters N , R, and both have a sphere decoding
complexity that is linear in the constellation size q. However,
the code discussed in Section III-A is fast-group-decodable
and 5 levels can be removed from the sphere decoding search
tree of its second decoding group [6]. Hence, this code uses
a 10-dimensional sphere decoder to decode the second group
of 16 symbols. On the other hand, the code from [8] uses a
16 dimensional search tree for decoding each ML decoding
group. Thus, the overall sphere decoding complexity of the
code from [6] is less than that of [8].
