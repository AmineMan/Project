Joint Optimization of the Transmit Covariance and
the Relay Precoder in General Gaussian
Amplify-and-Forward Relay Channels
Ramy H. Gohary and Halim Yanikomeroglu
Motivated by the potential gains and computational efﬁciency of AF relaying, in this paper we consider the joint
design of the input transmit covariance and the relay precoder
of an AF relay-assisted communication system with a direct
link between the source and the destination. Similar to [5],
we assume that the relay operates in a full-duplex mode.
As mentioned in [5], this joint optimization for a block
size greater than two is a “daunting” task. Indeed, it is a
non-convex problem with potentially high dimensionality. To
address this difﬁculty, we propose a technique for performing
the joint optimization of the input transmit covariance and the
relay precoder. First, we note that when the relay precoder
matrix is given, the design problem of the input covariance
can be cast in a convex form for which the Karush-KuhnTucker (KKT) conditions are necessary and sufﬁcient for
optimality. By analyzing these conditions, we obtain closed
form expressions of the optimal input covariance corresponding to an arbitrary relay precoder. Using these expressions,
it is shown that the maximum rate of the AF scheme is
achieved by subdiagonal precoders. This observation reduces
the number of optimization variables from being quadratic
to linear in the block length. In addition, it enables us to
identify precoders that satisfy necessary optimality conditions
at low and high transmit powers. These precoders possess an
interlacing structure, which implies that the relay transmits
during every other symbol interval, as in half-duplex operation.
Optimal precoders with this structure are obtained using an
efﬁcient algorithm that requires searching over two variables.

Abstract—The capacity of the amplify-and-forward (AF)
scheme in general full-duplex Gaussian relay channels is achieved
by Gaussian codebooks and can be cast as the solution of an
optimization problem of the input transmit covariance and the
relay precoder. This problem is non-convex. To circumvent this
difﬁculty, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used
to obtain closed form expressions of the optimal input covariance
that corresponds to an arbitrary relay precoder. Using these
expressions, it is shown the maximum rate of the AF scheme
is achieved by subdiagonal precoders. This observation is used
to facilitate the search for the optimal relay precoder, and to
show that at high transmit powers, it is optimal for the relay
to remain silent and, at low transmit powers, it is optimal to
operate in a mode that resembles half-duplex operation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The use of relays in wireless communications enables
signiﬁcantly higher data rates to be reliably communicated
between transmitter-receiver pairs [1]. Relay operation modes
can be classiﬁed into full-duplex in which the relays can
transmit and receive information on the same physical channel,
and half-duplex in which the relays transmit and receive
information on orthogonal channels. To ensure effective collaboration between the transmitter and the relay, both the
transmission scheme and the relaying mechanism have to be
designed jointly for the given channel conditions [2]. For
instance, when the transmitted signal, the signal observed
by the relay and the signal observed by the receiver form
a Markov chain, the relay channel is said to be physically
degraded, and the optimal full-duplex relaying strategy is the
decode-and-forward (DF) scheme [3]. On the other hand, when
the signal received by the relay is a physically degraded
version of the direct component of the signal observed by
the receiver, the channel is said to be reversely degraded and
the optimal strategy is for the relay to remain silent [3].
The capacity of a broad class of half-duplex relay channels
was obtained in [4]. In contrast, the capacity of general fullduplex relay channels that are neither degraded nor reversely
degraded, remains an open problem, and relaying techniques
other than DF are able to achieve higher data rates [5].
For instance, under certain channel conditions, the compressand-forward (CF) relaying scheme developed in [3] and the
amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme considered in [5] attain
higher rates than DF. In comparison with DF and CF, AF relaying is less computationally demanding and is hence suitable
for relaying terminals with low processing capabilities.

II. S YSTEM MODEL AND DESIGN PROBLEM
We consider the full-duplex AF relaying scheme for the
scalar quasi-static frequency-ﬂat Gaussian relay channel considered in [5] and shown in Figure 1. In this scheme, the signal
vector transmitted by the source is denoted by X ∈ Rk×1
and that received by the relay is denoted by Y1 ∈ Rk×1 .
The relay processes Y1 and generates a signal X1 ∈ Rk×1 .
To allow for symbol synchronization and signal processing,
the relay transmissions depends on the signal received in the
previous symbol intervals, but not the current one [5]. Hence,
the ﬁrst entry of X1 is zero. The signal vector received at
the destination is denoted by Y ∈ Rk×1 . The channel gain
between the source and the destination is normalized to unity,
that between the source and the relay is denoted by a, and
that between the relay and the destination is denoted by b.
Hence, the received signal of the relay can be expressed as

Y1 = aX +Z1 , where Z1 ∼ N (0, N I) is the additive Gaussian
noise at the relay, N is the noise variance and I is the k × k
identity matrix. The relay performs linear processing on Y1 ,
which is equivalent to left multiplying Y1 by a strictly lower
triangular precoder matrix D. The relay output is X1 = DY1 ,
and thus the received signal at the destination is
Y = X + bX1 + Z = (I + abD)X + bDZ1 + Z,

Tr(Σ) ≤ c1 ,

The matrix (µ1 I + µ2 DT D − Φ) = Σ + (H T H)−1
is
positive deﬁnite (cf. (4)) and Φ 0. Hence, we have µ1 I +
µ2 DT D ≻ 0 but since DT D is rank deﬁcient because D is
strictly lower triangular, it follows that µ1 > 0, which, together
with the second equality in (3d), yields Tr(Σ) = c1 .
From the ﬁrst condition in (3d), we have
Tr Φ (µ1 I + µ2 DT D − Φ)−1 − (H T H)−1

= 0.

(6)

Since both Φ and Σ are positive semideﬁnite, it follows that
either Φ = 0 or the columns of Φ span the null-space spanned
by the columns of Σ = (µ1 I + µ2 DT D − Φ)−1 − (H T H)−1 ;
that is, the condition in (6) is equivalent to

(3e)

Using this observation and solving (3a) for Σ, we have

(1)

det N (I + b2 DDT )

(3d)

= 0.

det(µ1 I + µ2 DT D − Φ) =

where Z ∼ N (0, N I) is the additive white Gaussian noise at
the destination; Z1 and Z are statistically independent. The
source and relay transmit power budgets for a block of k
channel uses are denoted by c1 and c2 , respectively.
From (1), it can be readily seen that the maximum rate
for this channel is achieved when the distribution of X is
Gaussian [6]; i.e., X ∼ N (0, Σ), where Σ = E{XX T } ∈
Rk×k is the input covariance matrix. In this case, the jointly
rate-optimal Σ and relay precoder D can be expressed as the
solution of the following optimization problem:

to the ﬁrst constraint in (2a), and µ1 and µ2 are the dual
variables corresponding to the second constraint in (2a) and
the constraint in (2b), respectively.
From the deﬁnition of the matrix H, it can be seen that
H T H ≻ 0. Hence, from (3a), we have

(µ1 I + µ2 DT D − Φ)−1 − (H T H)−1 Φ = 0.

(8)

where the second constraint in (2a) and the constraint in (2b)
ensure that the average powers transmitted from the source
and that transmitted by the relay during a block of k channel
uses do not exceed prescribed values c1 and c2 , respectively.
The optimization problem in (2) is non-convex in Σ and D
and hence is difﬁcult to solve. To tackle this problem, we begin
by assuming that a strictly lower triangular relay precoder D
is given. We then seek closed form expressions for the optimal
covariance matrix, Σ. We will later use these expressions to
guide the optimization of the precoder matrix, D.

We now consider µ1 , µ2 and Φ that solve (3). Note from (5)
that choosing µ1 , µ2 and Φ such that (µ1 I + µ2 DT D − Φ) =
H T H yields Σ = 0, which contradicts the condition that
Tr(Σ) = c1 . Three distinct cases can be considered; viz,
Case I: µ2 ≥ 0, Φ = 0, Case II-A: µ2 = 0, Φ = 0, and
Case II-B: µ2 > 0, Φ = 0. The last case is more general and
more involved than the ﬁrst two. Hence, we will focus herein
on this case. The other cases are considered in [10].

III. O PTIMIZING THE TRANSMIT COVARIANCE MATRIX

Using (7), the equality in (5) is cast in forms that are more
convenient to derive expressions for Σ and Φ. In particular,
multiplying both sides of (5) by (µ1 I + µ2 DT D − Φ) yields

Optimal Σ: The case of Φ = 0, µ2 > 0

FOR A GIVEN LINEAR RELAY PRECODER

With D ﬁxed, the problem in (2) is convex, and with c1 and
c2 strictly positive, it is strictly feasible. Hence, Slater’s condition holds and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions
are necessary and sufﬁcient for optimality [7]. Using results
from [8] and [9], the KKT conditions can be written as:

Left multiplying (9) by Σ yields

Σ(µ1 I + µ2 DT D)Σ = Σ − (H T H)−1 (µ1 I + µ2 DT D)Σ.

show next using the following lemma.

From (13) and (15) it is seen that A11 , C22 , ΛΣ and ΛΦ
are full rank and positive deﬁnite. Since, for any two square
matrices W1 and W2 , the eigenvalues of W1 W2 are the same
as the eigenvalues of W2 W1 , it follows that kΣ and kΦ =
k − kΣ must be such that the kΣ eigenvalues of B11 are less
than ν1 and the kΦ eigenvalues of B22 are greater than ν1 .
We now proceed to determine the orthogonal bases of Σ and
T ˜
Φ. From (13) and (15) it is seen that B21 = UΦ BUΦ = 0. To
determine UΦ and UΣ , we invoke the Schur decomposition of
an arbitrary asymmetric matrix W .
Lemma 1 (The Schur decomposition [11]): Let
W ∈ Rn×n be an asymmetric matrix with real eigenvalues.
For each such matrix there exists an orthonormal matrix Ψ
such that the matrix ΨW ΨT is upper triangular. The diagonal
entries of ΨW ΨT are the eigenvalues of W and their order
can be arbitrarily chosen depending on Ψ.

We now apply Lemma 1 to the matrix B. Let U be the Schur
˜ that arranges its eigenvalues in a non-decreasing
basis of B
˜ ˜˜
order, i.e., U T B U is upper triangular with non-decreasing
diagonal entries. From (13) and (15) we have that B21 = 0.
However, these equations do not require B11 and B22 to be
upper triangular. Hence, it can be seen that to satisfy these
equations, we can choose U = UΣ UΦ to be in the form

Proof: See Appendix C in [10].
From this proposition, and noting that the dual variable
ν1 can be readily eliminated from (21), it can be seen that
the optimal (Σ, D) pair can be determined by searching
over ν2 and the k − 1 degrees of freedom of precoders
of the form in (22). In other words, using Proposition 1,
ﬁnding the jointly optimal (Σ, D) pair reduces the search from
k(k − 1)/2 + 1 variables to k variables. Despite the reduction
in the search space, solving (21) for large k can be quite
difﬁcult. To circumvent this difﬁculty, in the next section we
will show how restricting D to be subdiagonal will enable us
to obtain solutions of the optimization problem in (21) that are
asymptotically optimal at low and high SNRs. The key to the
asymptotic analysis is to invoke Lemma 2 in the optimization
problem in (21) to show that this problem is equivalent to a
problem with the following objective:

– If the value of ν1 lies between the kΣ -th and kΣ + 1˜
th diagonal entries of B, determine Σ using (19).
Otherwise, kΣ ← kΣ + 1, and repeat.
• If no kΣ < k can be found, ν2 ← ν2 + δ, and repeat. 2
Note that this algorithm simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly in the cases of
ν2 = 0 and Φ = 0; cf. [10] for details.
In the next section, we will use the expression obtained for
the optimal Σ to gain insight into the optimal relay precoders.
IV. O PTIMIZING THE R ELAY P RECODER
In Section III, it was shown that the optimal Σ is
parametrized by D, ν1 and ν2 . Hence, ﬁnding a jointly
optimal input covariance-relay precoder pair can be cast as an
optimization problem in these variables. The cases in which
ν2 = 0 and Φ = 0 can be inferred from the case in which
ν2 > 0 and Φ = 0. Hence, we will focus on the latter case.
When ν2 > 0 and Φ = 0, the optimal Σ is given by
the expression in (19). We recall that in that expression
˜
U1 ∈ Rk×kΣ is the matrix containing the Schur vectors corresponding to the smallest kΣ eigenvalues of the (asymmetric)
˜
matrix B = (H T H)−1 I + ν2 DT D . Using (19), the relay
precoder optimization problem can be expressed as

The problem in (21) is non-convex. However, in the next
section we will show how this optimization problem can be
simpliﬁed without loss of optimality. We will then use this
simpliﬁcation to obtain input covariance-relay precoder pairs
that become asymptotically optimal at low and high SNRs.

Evaluating the constraints and the objective of the formulation equivalent to (21) requires analytical expressions for the
˜
eigenvalues of B −1 . Unfortunately, such expressions are not
known and only bounds and results pertaining to special forms
are available; see e.g., [12]. A classical result related to these
eigenvalues is stated in the following lemma [13, p. 312].
Lemma 3: If an eigenvalue of a matrix in the form in (25)
has multiplicity r, then at least r −1 of the subdiagonal entries
are zero, i.e., ζi1 = ζi2 = · · · = ζir−1 = 0 for ij ∈ {1, · · · , k−
1}, j = 1, . . . , r − 1.

In the next section, this result will be used to identify a class
of relay precoders that satisfy necessary optimality conditions
at low and high transmit powers.

The algorithm developed in Section III for optimizing Σ for
any given precoder D ∈ Rk×k required the search over the

result of this section is given in the following proposition:

VI. C ONCLUSION
The capacity of the amplify-and-forward scheme in fullduplex Gaussian relay channels is cast as the solution of a joint
optimization problem of the input covariance and the relay
precoder. The joint problem is not convex, but the problem
of ﬁnding the optimal input covariance for a given relay
precoder is convex. This observation enables us to use the
KKT conditions to obtain closed form expressions for the
optimal input covariance as a function of the given relay
precoder. Using these expressions, it was shown that restricting
the relay precoders to be subdiagonal, thereby reducing the
number of optimization variables from quadratic to linear
in the block length, does not incur loss of optimality. The
subdiagonal structure enables us to identify a class of relay
precoders that are asymptotically optimal at low and high
transmit powers. Precoders in this class transmit during every
other symbol interval, as in half duplex operation.

B. Asymptotically optimal D
We consider the case of c1 → 0. The case of c1 → ∞
follows similarly.
When c1 → 0, ν2 → 0 the constraint in (21d) becomes
redundant and can be dropped without loss of optimality.
Next, we assume that ν1 is given. Using Lemma 3, it can be
shown that the KKT conditions corresponding to the resulting
problem are satisﬁed only when the matrix D possesses an
k−1
interlacing subdiagonal structure; that is {σi }i=1 in (22) has
the following structure: σ2i = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k − 1, and
2
let σ2i−1 = 0 for i = 1, . . . , r, and σ2i−1 = σD > 0 for
i = r + 1, . . . , k , for some r ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1}.

We make two remarks regarding the interlacing subdiagonal
structure of D. First, in this case the joint optimization of D
and Σ reduces to a search over two variables ν1 and σD for
any k. Second, the interlacing structure implies that the relay
transmits during every other symbol interval, which resembles
operating in a half-duplex mode. The asymptotic optimality of
such precoders are illustrated in the next section.

V. N UMERICAL E XAMPLES
In this section, we provide a numerical example when the
block length, k = 4, the noise variance, N = 1, the sourcerelay channel gain, a = 1.25, and the relay-destination channel
gain, b = 0.7. The relay power budget c2 = 10 dB and the
transmitter power is varied between 0 and 20 dB.
In Figure 2, we plot the rates yielded the optimal input
covariance-relay precoder pair. This pair was obtained by
exhaustive search over subdiagonal precoders of the form
in (22) and applying Algorithm 1 to obtain the corresponding
optimal covariance matrix. In Figure 2, we plot the rates
corresponding to the asymptotically optimal relay precoders
obtained using an efﬁcient algorithm for optimizing Σ and
subdiagonal D with interlacing structure. For comparison, in
this ﬁgure we also plot the rates yielded by scaled identity
input covariance and the optimal covariance corresponding to a
√
subdiagonal precoder matrix with Di+1,i = 1/ 3, i = 1, 2, 3.
This ﬁgure shows that when the transmit power, c1 , is low
(less than 6 dB) or high (greater than 16 dB), the rate achieved
