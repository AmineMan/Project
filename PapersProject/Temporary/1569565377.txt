consider an integrated sensor device consisting of multiple
sensor interfaces [5] that can simultaneously measure multiple
information sources, which are modeled as parallel Gaussian
sources. Being part of the same device, the sensor interfaces
share the same overall resource budget. Moreover, since the
sensor interfaces have distinct hardwares and sensitivities, we
assume the sensing costs of different sources are generally
different. Finally, for tractability, we model the sensing cost
of a given source as being constant per source sample. This is
analogous to the model used in the literature to account for the
transmitter processing cost of the communication component
of a wireless device [6]. In [6], it was shown that, when the
transmitter processing energy cost is not negligible, it is no
longer optimal to transmit continuously, but instead, bursty
transmission is optimal in terms of the achievable rate.

Abstract—Energy efﬁciency is a key requirement in the design
of wireless sensor networks. While most theoretical studies only
account for the energy requirements of communication, the
sensing process, which includes measurements and compression,
can also consume comparable energy. In this paper, the problem
of sensing and communicating parallel sources is studied by
accounting for the cost of both communication and sensing. In
the ﬁrst formulation of the problem, the sensor has a separate
energy budget for sensing and a rate budget for communication,
while, in the second, it has a single energy budget for both tasks.
Furthermore, in the second problem, each source has its own
associated channel. Assuming that sources with larger variances
have lower sensing costs, the optimal allocation of sensing energy
and rate that minimizes the overall distortion is derived for the
ﬁrst problem. Moreover, structural results on the solution of
the second problem are derived under the assumption that the
sources with larger variances are transmitted on channels with
lower noise.

A. Contributions

I. I NTRODUCTION

With sensing costs present, we aim at optimizing the resource (energy or rate) allocation so as to minimize the overall
mean squared error distortion of all the sources. We consider
two types of resource constraints. In the ﬁrst, the sensor
has a given energy budget used for sensing and a separate
rate constraint for communication to the destination (separate
sensing/communication). In the second, the sensor has an
overall energy budget which is to be spent for both sensing and
communication (joint sensing/communication). Moreover, in
the joint sensing/communication scenario, the sensed sources
are assumed to be transmitted over orthogonal additive white
Gaussian channels with different noise variances. This set-up
can model a scenario in which different sensor interfaces of the
integrated device are used at different times and, to avoid delay
and buffer overﬂow, the measurements are transmitted over a
time-varying channel to the destination as they are measured.
For the separate sensing/communication problem, we obtain
a closed-form solution for the case where the sources with
larger variances have lower sensing costs. This corresponds to
a situation when sources with lower variances might require
more energy-consuming sensor interfaces with higher sensitivity for sensing. For the joint sensing/communication problem,
assuming that sources with larger variances not only have
lower sensing costs, but also are transmitted over channels
with lower noise variances, we obtain structural results on the
optimal solution. Moreover, a closed-form solution is obtained

Sensor networks consisting of battery-limited nodes need to
be operated in an energy-efﬁcient manner in order to attain a
satisfactory lifetime. Energy consumption of a sensor node
usually consists of both computational and communication
energy [1], which come primarily from sensing and communication. The sensing component consumes energy in the process
of digitizing given information sources through a cascade
of acquisition, sampling, quantization and compression tasks,
while the communication component spends power for the
transmit circuitry and for the power ampliﬁer. It is known
that the overall energy spent for compression is generally
comparable to that used for communication and that a joint
design of compression and transmission is critical to improve
the energy efﬁciency [2] [3]. We refer to the energy cost
associated with measurements and compression of information
sources as “sensing cost”.
The problem of allocating energy across sensing and
communication components of sensors in a wireless sensor
network, was studied in [4], where an on-line algorithm
that is able to choose between a ﬁnite number of possible
compression algorithms with different energy costs for a
multi-hop set-up was proposed. In this paper, instead, we

for the case where the energy budget is sufﬁciently large.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
formulate the problems of interest. Section III derives the analytical optimal solution to the separate sensing/communication
problem when the source variance and the sensing cost are
ordered. In Section IV, the structure of the optimal solution to
the joint sensing/communication problem is analyzed for the
ordered case. Finally, we make some concluding remarks in
Section V.

For the joint sensing/communication problem, the communication link is modeled as a collection of Q orthogonal
channels. We assume that the compressed version of the sensed
samples from the ith source (1 ≤ i ≤ Q) are transmitted over
the ith channel, which is an independent complex Gaussian
noise channel with noise variance Ni . Each channel consists
of nτ channel uses, where τ is the channel-source bandwidth
ratio for each source-channel pair. It is also assumed that the
sensor has a joint energy constraint B on the sensing and
communication components. Similar to E and R in Section
II-A, the energy B is normalized by n as well. The sensor
measures a fraction θS,i , with 0 ≤ θS,i ≤ 1, of the samples
of the ith source, and transmits the corresponding compressed
samples with power Pi (Pi ≥ 0) over the ith channel. The
MSE of the reproduction of the ith source at the destination

VARIANCE / COST CASE

(1)

In this section, we consider the separate sensing and communication problem described in Section II-A. To facilitate
the analysis, we divide the Q Gaussian sources into K classes
with class k (1 ≤ k ≤ K) containing qk sources with the
2
same variance σk . Without loss of generality, the variances
2
2
2
are in descending order, i.e., σ1 > σ2 > ... > σK . Since
each class can contain an arbitrary number qk of sources, we
have strict inequalities among the variances. It is also assumed

We deﬁne the sampling fraction vector and rate allocation
vector as θ S = [θS,1 ... θS,Q ]T and R = [R1 ... RQ ]T ,
respectively. The problem of minimizing the total MSE is

B. Joint Sensing/Communication of Parallel Sources

A. Separate Sensing/Communication of Parallel Sources
For the separate sensing/communication problem, we assume the sensor has an energy budget E to be used exclusively
for sensing of the Q sources, and a total rate R that can be
allocated for communication. Both E and R are normalized
by n so that E is the energy budget per source sample and
similarly for R. When E and R are limited, it might not be
optimal, or possible, to sense all the samples from all the
sources. We assume instead that the sensor node measures a
fraction θS,i , with 0 ≤ θS,i ≤ 1, of samples from of the ith
source, and then sends a compressed version of the sensed
samples of the ith source with rate Ri (Ri ≥ 0). Given the
above, the mean square error (MSE) of the reconstruction
at the destination for the ith source can be obtained as

II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
We consider a system in which a sensor measures Q
independent parallel Gaussian sources and communicates them
to a single destination. The ith source consists of n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples with variance
2
σi , i = 1, ..., Q. In this paper, we assume measuring each
sample of the ith source entails a given sensing cost S,i
joules per source sample, which takes into account the energy
spent for acquisition, sampling, quantization and compression.
Note that, more generally, the energy costs associated with
quantization and compression may depend on the compression
rate and the target distortion level [7], which is not pursued
here for simplicity. We are interested in minimizing the overall
average distortion D of the reproduction of the sources at
the destination. We consider two related problems. In the ﬁrst
(separate sensing/communication), we assume that the sensor
has two resource budgets, an energy budget for sensing and
a rate budget for communication. In the second (joint sensing/communication), instead, we consider energy allocation
between the tasks of sensing and communications.

that sources in class k have the same sensing cost S,k and
that sources with larger variances have lower sensing costs,
i.e., S,1 ≤ ... ≤ S,K . Such an order would be valid if more
energy-consuming sensor interfaces with higher sensitivities
are required to measure sources with lower variances. Note
that, while for the general case, the problem in (2)-(3) can
be shown to be convex, there is no closed-form solution.
For details, we refer to the reader to [9]. Focusing on the
ordered case allows us to obtain an analytical expression for
the optimal solution and gain insights into the problem.

set. Details of the proof are provided in [9].
Before we discuss the solution given in Proposition 1,
we revisit the classical reverse water-ﬁlling approach, which
solves the separate sensing and communication problem in
(2) in the case of zero sensing costs, i.e., S,k = 0 for all
1 ≤ k ≤ K. With zero sensing costs, it is optimal to sample
∗
all of the sources fully, that is, θS,k = 1 for all 1 ≤ k ≤ K.
Moreover, if R ∈ Rl with 1 ≤ l ≤ K, only the ﬁrst l source
classes are assigned positive rates and the rate allocation is
given by (8). It is noted that this rate allocation leads to the
∗
2
same distortion level σk 2−2Rk for all the sources that are
assigned a non-zero rate. Proposition 1 states that, when the
sensing costs are taken into account, the optimal solution in the
j=1,j=k
ordered case entails sensing sources with the highest variances
(8) and then optimally allocating rates among the sensed sources
where 1 ≤ k ≤ l. Moreover, there is no need to sense using either the reverse water-ﬁlling procedure or a variation

e.g., [10]).
By the convexity of function D(θ S , R), it is easy to see that
we can assume the same fraction θS,k and rate Rk are assigned
to each source in the kth class1 . We have the following result.

Proposition 1: For K ≥ 2, assuming σ1 > ... > σK and
S,1 ≤ ... ≤ S,K , the optimal solution for the separate sensing

distortion of the non-sampled fraction.
We pictorially illustrate the solution for case 2) of Proposition 1 in Fig. 1, where we assume K = 5 and qk = 1,
k = 1, ..., 5. In this example, the energy E and the rate
R are assumed to satisfy e2 < E < e3 and R > r4 .
Thus, it is optimal to have source 1 and source 2 both
fully sampled and have source 3 only partially sampled for

a fraction θS,3 = (E − e2 )/ S,3 . The ﬁrst two sources and the
sampled fraction of source 3 are all described with the same

Since source 4 and source 5 are not sampled at all, they
are assigned zero rates and thus the corresponding distortions
are equal to their variances. Recall that in the zero sensing
cost case, all the ﬁve sources would be fully sampled and
since R > r4 , all of them would be described with the same

Proof: With θS,1 = ... = θS,K = 1, the optimization of
powers P in (5) is convex and can be easily performed using
the standard Lagrangian approach [12].
It is interesting to note that, unlike the reverse waterﬁlling solution, all the source-channel pairs that are allocated
positive powers (or positive rates for reverse water-ﬁlling) are
not assigned the same distortion level in the joint sensing
and communication problem considered here. Instead, the

distortion level Dk = σk (1 + Pk /Nk )−2τ for any class k that
1
2 2τ
is assigned a positive power is proportional to (σk Nk ) 2τ +1
(See [9] for details). This shows that only in the special case
2 2τ
σk Nk = 1 for all 1 ≤ k ≤ m, all the source-channel pairs
with positive powers have the same distortion.
Now we proceed to analyze the problem in (5)-(6) for the
ordered case when there are nonzero sensing costs.
2
2
Proposition 2: For K ≥ 2, assuming σ1 > ... > σK , 0 <
S,1 ≤ ... ≤ S,K and N1 ≤ ... ≤ NK , it is optimal to sense
and transmit only the ﬁrst m source classes, for some m with
1 ≤ m ≤ K depending on the energy budget B. Moreover,
for the sensed m classes, the sampling fractions satisfy 0 <

Proof: The structural results on the optimal solution
are obtained using the KKT conditions. As in the proof of
Proposition 1, special care must be taken since the objective
function in (5) is not continuously differentiable in the entire
feasible set. Details of the proof are provided in [9].
Proposition 2 suggests that the sources with larger variances are sampled for a fraction greater than or equal to
that of the sources with smaller variances. While this is
an important property of the optimal solution to the joint
sensing/communication problem in the presence of nonzero
sensing costs, it appears difﬁcult to obtain an analytical
characterization of the optimal solution even for the ordered
case. In the following, we characterize the optimal solution in
closed form for the special case when the energy budget is
sufﬁciently large so that all sources can be fully sensed. We
also compute the minimum energy budget that guarantees this.

In Section III, we have investigated the optimal solution
to the separate sensing and communication problem in (2)(3) when source variances and sensing costs are ordered. In
this section, we analyze the joint sensing and communication
problem in (5)-(6) when the source variances, the sensing
costs and the channel noise variances are ordered. Similar to
Section III, we divide the Q parallel source-channel pairs into
K classes, with class k having qk source-channel pairs, where
1 ≤ k ≤ K. It is assumed that the sources in class k have
2
the same variance σk and the channels in class k have the
same noise variance Nk . Following Section III, we assume
2
2
2
the source variances satisfy σ1 > σ2 > ... > σK and the
sensing costs satisfy S,1 ≤ ... ≤ S,K . It is also assumed that
the channel noise variances satisfy N1 ≤ ... ≤ NK . While for
the general case, the problem in (5)-(6) can be shown to be
convex (see [9]), there is no closed form solution. However,
for the ordered case described above, ﬁnding an analytical
solution in closed form is possible under certain conditions.
Similar to Section III, it can be readily shown that it is
optimal to allocate the same sampling fraction θS,k and the
same transmit power Pk to all source-channel pairs in class k.
For convenience, we divide the range of B to a sequence of
intervals: B1 = (b0 , b1 ], B2 = (b1 , b2 ],..., BK = (bK−1 , bK ),
where b0 = 0, bK = +∞, and

set θS,k = 1 for all 1 ≤ k ≤ K, without loss of optimality.

with either separate constraints on the sensing energy budget
and on the communication rates, or a joint constraint on the
energy budget for both sensing and transmission. For both
problems, we studied the special case in which sources with
larger variances have lower sensing costs. We showed that,
for the separate sensing/communication problem, the optimal
strategy is to sense the sources starting from the one with the
largest variance and to allocate the communication rate using
reverse water-ﬁlling, or a variant of it, on the sensed sources.
Moreover, for the joint sensing/communication problem, it is
generally optimal to sense, possibly partially, only a subset
of the sources with the largest variances and to allocate the
transmit powers among their respective channels.

where 1 ≤ k ≤ K.
Proof: Details of the proof are provided in [9].
Proposition 3 states that, if the energy budget is larger than
the threshold ¯ then it is optimal to fully sample all the sources
b,
and to allocate power as for the case with no sensing costs
(see (11)) but with energy budget discounted by the energy
K
needed for sensing (i.e., with energy B − j=1 qj S,j ). It is
interesting to note that the threshold ¯ is, in fact, strictly larger
b
K
than bK−1 + j=1 qj S,j . We recall that bK−1 is the energy
threshold above which it is optimal to assign positive powers to
all K classes of source-channel pairs in the zero sensing cost
K
case, while j=1 qj S,j is the total sensing energy needed to
sense all the sources.
Fig. 2 shows the optimal sampling fractions for the joint
sensing/communication problem as a function of energy bud2

and σ2 = 1, S,1 = S,2 = 1, N1 = N2 = 4. The results
are obtained via numerical methods [11]. It can be seen from
∗
∗
Fig. 2, for any B, θ1 is greater than or equal to θ2 , which
is consistent with the optimal structure derived in Proposition
2. Moreover, when 2 < B < 3, both sources are partially
sampled, which is not encountered in the optimal solution of
the separate sensing and communication problem of Section
III. As B grows beyond 6, both classes are fully sampled.
This threshold corresponds to threshold ¯ in (12) with K = 2
b
and is strictly larger than b1 + q1 S,1 + q2 S,2 = 2.3. It can
be observed from Fig. 2 that, if 2.3 < B < 6, the optimal
solution entails partial sampling of at least source 2 which has
the lower variance. In this case, fully sampling both sources
is strictly suboptimal.

V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we studied an energy-constrained sensor
system that has a constant sensing energy cost per source
sample and we investigated the impact of the sensing energy cost on the end-to-end distortion of parallel Gaussian
sources. We formulated a distortion minimization problem
