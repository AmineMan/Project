As a warm up we discuss, when it is possible to achieve
the generalized full rank condition for two users, each having
a single transmit antenna. In particular these results clarify
the construction of BB-code in [10]. Then in Section IV
we will give our general construction and state that such an
construction always exists and that each code does fulﬁll the
generalized rank criteria. In Section V we analyze the decay
of the constructed codes. In particular Theorem 5.4 gives a
general lower bound and Corollary 5.5 shows that our codes
achieves the pigeon hole bound. In the last section we give
few explicit examples of our codes.

Abstract—This paper provides a general construction method
for multiple-input multiple-output multiple access channel codes
(MIMO MAC codes) that have so called generalized full rank
property. The achieved constructions give a positive answer to the
question whether it is generally possible to reach the so called
pigeon hole bound, that is an upper bound for the decay of
determinants of MIMO-MAC channel codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In MIMO MAC the DMT optimality criteria can be given
by splitting the whole error probability space to separate error
events and then giving a criteria for each event separately. In
the case where each user is in error, the criteria given in [2]
closely resembles that of the classical NVD condition used in
single user case. This criteria would give us a natural goal if
we would like to build DMT achieving codes. Unfortunately in
[5] it was proved that this criteria is too tight in the case where
the codes of the single users are lattice space-time codes.
The pigeon hole bound in [5] proves that, irrespective of the
code design, the determinants of the overall code matrices will
decay with a polynomial speed.
In [3] it was proved that the two user single antenna code
(BB-code) given in [10] do achieve the pigeon hole bound.
In this paper we are giving a wast generalization of BB-code
to general MAC-MIMO. The codes we will build fulﬁll the
so called generalized rank criteria and do reach the pigeon
hole bound. Our method will share the basic structure with
the original generalization of BB-code given in [9].
The single user codes we are using are based on the multiblock codes from division algebras [6]. This approach has been
taken in several recent papers on MIMO-MAC. However, in
these papers the full rank criteria has been achieved by using
either transcendental elements [9] (with exception of nt =
2 case, which is dealt with algebraic elements having low
degree) or algebraic elements with high degree [4]. Both of
these methods make it extremely difﬁcult to measure the decay
of the codes and likely lead to bad decay.
Instead of the usual algebraic independence strategy we
will use valuation theory to achieve the full rank condition.
This technical tool allows us to use algebraic elements with
low degree. By applying Galois theoretic method of Lu et al.
[5] and methods from Diophantine approximation, originally
introduced by Lahtonen et al. in [3], we will prove that our
codes achieve good decay and in particular reach the pigeon
hole bound.

II. D ECAY FUNCTION ,

MULTIUSER CODE , AND OTHER
DEFINITIONS

In this paper we are considering MIMO MAC code design
in the Rayleigh ﬂat fading channel. We suppose that we have
U users, each having nt antennas and that the receiver has
nr antennas and complete channels state information. We also
suppose that the fading for each user stays stable for U nt
time units. Let us refer to the channel matrix of the ith user
with Hi ∈ Mnr ×nt and let us suppose that each of these have
i.i.d complex Gaussian random variables with zero mean and
unit variance as coefﬁcients. In this scenario the base station
receives
U
∑
Y =
Hi Xi + N,
i=1

where, Xi ∈ Mnt ×U nt (C), is the transmitted codeword from
the ith user, and N ∈ Mnr ×nt U (C) presents the noise having
i.i.d complex Gaussian random variables as coefﬁcients.
In this scenario multiuser MIMO signal is a U nt × U nt
matrix where the rows (j − 1)nt + 1, (j − 1)nt + 2, . . . , (j −
1)nt + nt represent jth user’s signal (j = 1, . . . , U ).
We suppose that each user applies a lattice space-time code
Lj ⊆ Mnt ×U nt , j = 1, . . . , U . We also assume that each
user’s lattice is of full rank r = 2U n2 , and denote the basis
t
of the lattice Lj by Bj,1 , . . . , Bj,r . Now the code associated
with the jth user is a restriction of lattice Lj
{ r
}
∑
Lj (Nj ) =
bi Bj,i |bi ∈ Z, −Nj ≤ bi ≤ Nj ,
i=1

where Nj is a given positive number.
Using these deﬁnitions the U -user MIMO MAC code is
(L1 (N1 ), L2 (N2 ), . . . , LU (NU )).

For a matrix M (X1 , . . . , XU ) = (X1 , X2 , . . . , XU )T
where Xj ∈ Lj (Nj ) that jth user has sent, we deﬁne

D(N1 , . . . , NU ) =

min

Xj ∈Lj (Nj )\{0}

IV. M ULTI ACCESS CODE WITH SEVERAL TRANSMISSION
ANTENNAS

A. Construction of U -user code for nt transmission antennas

|det M (X1 , . . . , XU )| .

From now on we concentrate on the scenario where we
have U ∈ Z+ users and each user has nt ∈ Z+ transmission
antennas. Throughout this section we assume K to be an
imaginary quadratic extension of Q with class number 1, L
is a cyclic Galois extension of K of degree U nt , such that
L = K(α) with α ∈ R, σ a generating element in Gal(L/K)
and p ∈ OK an inert prime in L/K. We also deﬁne τ = σ U
and F to be the ﬁxed ﬁeld of τ . So we have [L : F ] = nt ,
[F : K] = U , Gal(L/F ) =< τ >, and Gal(F/K) =< σF >
where σF is a restriction of σ in F . Let v = vp be the padic valuation of the ﬁeld L. In this section, when we say that
L/K, p, and σ are suitable we mean that they are as above.
Due to the space limitations, we skip the proof of the
following proposition.
Proposition 4.1: For every complex quadratic ﬁeld K, having class number 1, and for any U and for any nt we have
a suitable degree nt U extension L/K, prime p ∈ OK and
automorphism σ ∈ Gal(L/K).
Now we are ready for our construction. Let xj ∈ OL for
all j = 1, . . . , nt . Deﬁne M = M (x1 , x2 , . . . , xnt ) to be


x1
pτ (xnt ) pτ 2 (xnt −1 ) . . . pτ nt −1 (x2 )
 x2
τ (x1 )
pτ 2 (xnt )
. . . pτ nt −1 (x3 ) 



xnt
τ (xnt −1 ) τ 2 (xnt −2 ) . . . τ nt −1 (x1 )

This is called the decay function. In the special case N1 =
. . . = NU = N we write
D(N ) = D(N1 = N, . . . , NU = N ).
If we have a U -user code with decay function
D(N1 , . . . , Nn ), such that D(N1 , . . . , Nn ) ̸= 0 for all
N1 , . . . , NU ∈ Z+ , we say that the code satisﬁes (generalized) rank criterion.
III. 2- USER CODE
In [10] Badr and Belﬁore introduced a 2-user single antenna
MAC√
code where the matrix coefﬁcients were from the ﬁeld
Q(i, 5). In the following we give a complete characterization of when their construction method leads to codes with
generalized full rank property.
∗
By OL we mean the ring of integers of ﬁeld L and OL is
the ring of integers of L without zero element.
Theorem 3.1: Let K/Q and L/K be two ﬁeld extensions
of degree 2 and a, b, c, d ∈ L. Let also σ be the non-trivial
element in the Galois group Gal(L/K). Deﬁne
{(
)
}
ax bσ(x)
∗
C=
|x, y ∈ OL .
cy dσ(y)
There exists a matrix in C with zero determinant if and only
if
N (a) N (b)
= 0,
(1)
N (c) N (d)

i.e. a matrix representation of an element in the cyclic algebra
(L/F, τ, p). The following lemma proves that (L/F, τ, p) is a
division algebra.
Lemma 4.2: Let xj ∈ OL for all j = 1, . . . , nt such that
xl ̸= 0 for some l and min(v(x1 ), . . . , v(xnt )) = 0. Then we
have
det(M (x1 , x2 , . . . , xnt )) ̸= 0

where the function N = NL/K denotes the norm of extension
L/K.
Proof: Assume ﬁrst that we have a matrix
(
)
ax bσ(x)
cy dσ(y)
with zero determinant. This means that adxσ(y) =
bcσ(x)y, which gives N (a)N (d)N (x)N (σ(y))
=
N (b)N (c)N (σ(x))N (y). Continuing we get N (a)N (d) =
N (b)N (c) i.e. N (a)N (d) − N (b)N (c) = 0.
Assume then that N (a)N (d) − N (b)N (c) = 0. If b or c is
zero then N (a)N (d) = 0 i.e. a or d is zero and then for all
x, y ∈ OL we have
ax bσ(x)
cy dσ(y)

and
v(det(M (x1 , x2 , . . . , xnt ))) ≤ nt − 1.
Proof: Write M = M (x1 , x2 , . . . , xnt ) and N =
NL/F . Assume ﬁrst that v(x1 ) = 0. Then the determinant
is N (x1 ) + py for some y ∈ OL and hence we have
v(det(M )) = min(v(N (x1 )), v(py)) = 0. Assume then that
v(x1 ), v(x2 ), . . . , v(xl−1 ) > 0 and v(xl ) = 0 with 1 < l ≤ nt .
Notice that in this case all the other elements a of matrix
M than those in the left lower corner block of side length
nt − l + 1 have v(a) > 0. Either they have coefﬁcient p
or they are automorphic images of elements x1 , x2 , . . . , xl−1 .
Now det(M ) = ±pl−1 N (xl ) + pl z for some z ∈ OL
since all the other terms except ±pl−1 N (xl ) have at most
nt − l factors from this left lower corner and hence at least
nt − (nt − l) = l terms have factor p. This gives that
v(det(M )) = min(v(pl−1 N (xl )), v(pl z)) = l − 1 ≤ nt − 1.

= 0.

Otherwise N ( ad ) = 1. Then by Hilbert 90 we have some
bc
∗
z ∈ L such that ad = σ(z) . Then write z = w with w ∈ OL
bc
z
n
σ(w)
ad
and n ∈ Z. This gives bc = w i.e. adw − bcσ(w) = 0.
This means that the determinant of
(
)
aw bσ(w)
c1 dσ(1)
is zero.

Theorem 4.5: Let CU,nt ∈ CU,nt . The code CU,nt is a full
rate code and satisﬁes the generalized rank criterion.
Proof: Let A ∈ CU,nt = CU,nt (L/K, p, σ, k). We
may assume that min(v(xj,1 ), . . . , v(xj,nt )) = 0, for all
j = 1, . . . , U , because otherwise we can divide extra p’s off.
That does not have any impact on whether det(A) = 0 or not.
The determinant of A is

Deﬁnition 4.1: Deﬁne Mj = M (xj,1 , xj,2 , . . . , xj,nt ) for
all j = 1, . . . , U . In our multi access system the code Cj of
jth user consists of nt × U nt matrices Bj =
(
)
Mj , σ(Mj ), σ 2 (Mj ), . . . , p−k σ j−1 (Mj ), . . . , σ U −1 (Mj )
t
where k is any rational integer strictly greater than U (n2−1)
and xj,l ̸= 0 for some l. Here k is same for all users. The the
whole code CU,nt consists of matrices

where v(y)
≥
−k(U nt − 2). We know that
v(σ l−1 (det(Ml ))) = v(det(Ml )) because p is from K,
i.e. from the ﬁxed ﬁeld of σ, and det(Ml ) ̸= 0 for all l.
Therefore

that the

det(σ l−1 (Ml ))) = −kU n +

and hence v(y) ≤ U (nt − 1 − knt ) implying −k(U nt − 2) ≤
t
U (nt − 1 − knt ). This gives 2k ≤ U (nt − 1) i.e. k ≤ U (n2−1)
a contradiction.
Remark 4.1: Using multiblock codes from division algebras
as single user codes in the MIMO MAC scenario has been
used before for example in [10], [4] and [5]. In [10] the full
rank condition for codes with nt > 1 is achieved by using
transcendental elements. In [4] the same effect is achieved
with algebraic elements of high degree.
V. O N THE DECAY FUNCTION OF CODES IN CU,nt
In this section we will prove an asymptotic lower bound
for the decay function of codes from CU,nt . In [3] the authors
give a general asymptotic upper bound for a decay function in
the case that only one user is properly using the code i.e. N1
can be anything but N2 = · · · = NU = 1 are restricted. We
will see that in this special case our codes have asymptotically
the best possible decay.
Lemma 5.1: Let CU,nt = CU,nt (L/K, p, σ, k) ∈ CU,nt ,
A ∈ CU,nt , and let F be the ﬁxed ﬁeld of τ = σ U . Then
det(A) ∈ F .
Proof: As F is the ﬁxed ﬁeld of τ it is enough
to prove that τ (det(A)) = det(A). Write again Mj =
M (xj,1 , xj,2 , . . . , xj,nt ) and notice that τ (Mj ), after switching
ﬁrst and last column and ﬁrst and last row, is


xj,1

τ 2 (xj,nt −1 ) . . . τ nt −1 (xj,2 )

where L/K, p, σ, and k are any suitable ones.
According to Proposition 4.1 we can always ﬁnd suitable
L/K, p, σ, and k for any U ∈ Z+ and nt ∈ Z+ . We therefore
have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.4: For any choice of U ∈ Z+ and nt ∈ Z+ we
have CU,n ̸= ∅.
Note that the code CU,1 = CU,1 (L/K, p, σ, 1) ∈ CU,1 ,
a code for U users each having one transmission antenna,
consists of matrices of form

We will skip the proof of the following proposition, stating
that each of the single user codes satisﬁes the NVD condition
and are therefore DMT optimal.
Proposition 4.3: Let CU,nt ∈ CU,nt and Cj be the jth users
code in the system CU,nt for some j ∈ 1, . . . , U . Then the
code Cj is a 2U n2 -dimensional lattice code with the NVD
t
property.
The code depends on how we did choose L/K, p, σ,
and k, so to be precise, we can also refer to CU,nt with
CU,nt (L/K, p, σ, k). Let us call the family of all such codes
CU,nt (L/K, p, σ, k) (i.e. codes constructed with any suitable
L/K, p, σ, and k) by CU,nt . That is
∪
{CU,nt (L/K, p, σ, k)}
CU,nt =

Let us call the above matrix A′ . We notice that matrices A
and A′ are exactly similar apart from the fact that in Mj
elements in places (1, 2), (1, 3), . . . , (1, nt ) have coefﬁcient
p−k and elements in places (2, 1), (3, 1), . . . , (nt , 1) have not
′
coefﬁcient p−k and in Mj these are vice versa. But this
does not change the value of the determinant because in the
expansion of the determinant each summand include a product
of same number of elements from columns that are congruent
to 1 modulo nt and from rows that are congruent to 1 modulo
nt .
Theorem 5.2: [7] For any full-rate U -user lattice code, each
user transmitting with nt antennas there exists a constant k >
0 such that

For the next theorem we need few deﬁnitions. Let p(x) =
p0 + p1 x + · · · + pm xm ∈ Z[x] be a polynomial. Then
we say that H(p(x)) = max{|pj |} is the height of the
polynomial p(x) and for an algebraic number α we deﬁne
H(α) = H(ϕα ) where ϕα is the minimal polynomial of α.
The next generalization of Liouville’s theorem can be found
from [8, p. 31].
Theorem 5.3: Let α ∈ R be an algebraic number of degree
κ, H(α) ≤ h, H(P ) ≤ H and deg(P (x)) = m ∈ Z+ . Then
either P (α) = 0 or
|P (α)| ≥

as usual.
Now for any j = 0, . . . , U nt − 1 we have
σ j (xm,h ) =

∑

um,h,l σ j (γl )

l=1

where um,h,l ∈ Z and |um,h,l | ≤ Nm for all m, h and l.

Now we are ready to give a lower bound for the decay
function of our codes. The proof can be seen as an extension
to the analysis given for BB-code in [3].

Proof: Let CU,nt = CU,nt (L/K, p, σ, k). Field extension L/Q has a basis S1 ∪ S2 where S1 =
{1, δ, δ 2 , . . . , δ U −1 , β, βδ, βδ 2 , . . . , βδ U −1 } is a basis of F/Q
√
with δ ∈ R, K = Q(β) and β = −w for some positive
integer w. Notice that if L = F then S2 = ∅.
The ring OL has a Z-basis {γ1 , . . . , γ2U nt }. Each of these
basis elements can be presented as
∑
γl =
sl,a a,

where K1 ∈ Q is some constant, ua ∈ Z, and ua =
O((N1 . . . NU )nt ).
Writing also p using basis S1 ∪ S2 we see that the whole
determinant det(A) can be written as a sum of elements of
form
∑
u′ a
a
a∈S1 ∪S2

multiplied by some constant K2 and here we have u′ ∈ Z,
a
and u′ = O((N1 . . . NU )nt ).

On the other hand we know that det(A) ∈ F so by
uniqueness of basis representation we know that det(A) is
a sum consisting of elements of form

where Hl , Jl ∈ Z and |Hl |, |Jl | are of size O((N1 · · · NU )nt )
for all l = 0, . . . , U − 1.

VII. C ONCLUSION
We gave a general construction for MIMO MAC codes
satisfying the generalized rank criteria and gave a lower bound
for their decay. As a corollary we got that all our codes do
achieve the pigeon hole bound.

Let us now give few examples of our general code constructions. In table Table 1 we have collected some examples
of suitable ﬁelds K and L and inert primes p, fulﬁlling the
conditions of Proposition 4.1. If √ = Q(i) then pi OK refers
K
to the inert prime and if K = Q( −3) then p√−3 OK is inert.
The inert primes and ﬁelds L are found by looking at totally
real subﬁelds of Q(ζm )/Q and then composing them with the
ﬁeld K.

We get a code C3,1 = C3,1 (Q(i, ζ7 + ζ7 ), 2 + i, σ, 1) i.e.
3-user code with each user having 1 antenna by setting L =
−1
K(ζ7 + ζ7 ), K = Q(i), p = 2 + i, and Gal(L/K) =< σ >.
Now the actual code consists of matrices
