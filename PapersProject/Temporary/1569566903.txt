where α and β are chosen such that the (individual) capacities
of all channels are equal, viz.
C p2p 2 log(1 + |α|2 P/2) = log(1 + |β|2 P ) .
(2)
This example models a “near–far” scenario in which the
two “near” users have one antenna each, where each receives
a different transmit antenna stream, whereas the “far” user is
equipped with two antennas to compensate for the distance
attenuation, such that the capacities of all channels are equal.
A na¨ve approach would be to use Vertical Bell-Laboratories
ı
Space–Time coding (V-BLAST) [1] or generalized decision
feedback equalization (GDFE) [2]. This approach is based
upon the QR decomposition, in which the output of the
channel is multiplied by a unitary matrix, resulting in an
effective triangular channel matrix. In the case of the example,
however, repetition coding across the antennas must be used,
to convey the (common) message to users 2 and 3. This, in
turn, implies that the far user (user 1) cannot enjoy any of its
multiplexing gain (which is equal to two in this case), due to
the repetition that is carried across the two transmit antennas.
Again, in the high SNR regime, this suggests a loss of
approximately half of the optimal achievable rate. Moreover,
for this example the “max–min beamforming” technique (see,
e.g., [3] and references therein) reduces to this scheme as well,
meaning that it suffers the same losses in performance.
Another approach considered in the literature for this problem is that of using a “pure open-loop” approach, namely
Alamouti [4] — for the two-transmit antenna case, and space–
time coding [5] — for more. The performance of these
schemes does not depend on the number of receivers. However,
this universality comes at the price of a substantial rate loss
for MIMO channels having several receive antennas, as these
schemes use only a single stream, thus failing to achieve the
multiplexing gain offered by the MIMO channel.2
Finally note that time/frequency sharing suggest a great loss
in performance (up to two thirds of the capacity in this case).
In general, to the best of our knowledge known practical
schemes are limited to the smallest number of degrees of
freedom (“multiplexing gain“) of the different users, or alternatively incorporate time- or frequency-sharing, which again
lose degrees of freedom. Thus, these schemes achieve only a
fraction of the available degrees of freedom.
In this work we develop a scheme that achieves the degrees
of freedom of each individual channel, by enabling the transmission of several streams as is done in V-BLAST/GDFE in

Abstract—Multicasting is the general method of conveying the
same information to multiple users over a broadcast channel.
In this work, the Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel is considered, with multiple users and any number of antennas at
each node. A “closed loop” scenario is assumed, for which a
practical capacity-achieving multicast scheme is constructed. In
the proposed scheme, linear modulation is carried over time and
space together, which allows to transform the problem into that of
transmission over parallel scalar sub-channels, the gains of which
are equal, except for a fraction of sub-channels that vanishes with
the number of time slots used. Over these sub-channels, off-theshelf ﬁxed-rate AWGN codes can be used to approach capacity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
A recurring theme in digital communications is the use
of a standard “off-the-shelf” coding module in combination
with appropriate linear pre/post processing which is tailored
to the speciﬁc channel model. Such methods are appealing
due to their low complexity of implementation as well as
conceptually, since the task of coding and modulation are
effectively decoupled.
Underlying such decoupling schemes is the existence of a
diagonalization transformation. For time-invariant scalar systems, this is possible via the Fourier transform. The singularvalue decomposition (SVD) plays a similar role for Gaussian
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In recent
years, as coding and decoding for single-user scalar channels
has reached a mature stage, research effort has shifted to
tackling the more ambitious goal of efﬁcient multi-user (and
multi-antenna) communication networks.
Extension of the decoupling approach which is at the heart
of single-user scalar systems to a multiple-user MIMO network requires, however, overcoming a major hurdle: (unitary)
simultaneous diagonalization is in general not possible.1
Hence, different practical approaches were proposed over
the years for the problem of multicasting over Gaussian MIMO
broadcast channels. However, none of these approaches is capacity achieving in general, even for simple cases. To illustrate
this, consider the following simple three-user example:
y i = Hi x + z i ,
i = 1, 2, 3 ,
where z i are white Gaussian noises with unit power (for each
element), x is the channel vector subject to an average power
constraint P , and Hi are the complex-valued channel matrices

if all matrices are diagonal, constructing a practical capacityachieving scheme is hard, since using scalar coding over the resulting parallel
channels is limited to working w.r.t. the minimal gain over each sub-channel.

the point-to-point case. This is done by designing a special
space–time coding structure that is tailored for the speciﬁc
channel matrices, where the number of channel uses that is
needed to be jointly processed depends on the number of
users in the system. However, in contrast to the open-loop
space–time coding structures, which strive for an “orthogonal
design” structure (see, e.g., [5]), the space–time structure
presented in this work results in triangular forms, similar to
V-BLAST/GDFE, but having equal diagonals, which suggests
in turn, the optimality of the scheme. This gives rise to effective parallel scalar additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channels, over which standard codes can be used to approach
capacity. Thus, the proposed scheme could be thought of as
an interpolation between the open-loop space–time coding
technique and the point-to-point V-BLAST one.

any restriction on the communication problem addressed. The
GMD [7] of a square complex invertible matrix A is given by:
A = UT V † ,

where U , V are unitary matrices, and T is an upper-triangular
matrix such that all its diagonal values equal to the geometric
mean of the singular values of A, which is real and positive.
Building on the GMD, the following decomposition, which
will be referred to as Joint Equi-diagonal Triangularization
(JET), was introduced in [8]. Let A1 and A2 be two invertible complex matrices of dimensions n × n such that
| det(A1 )| = | det(A2 )|. Then, the joint triangularization of A1
and A2 is given by:
†
A1 = U 1 R1 V

(4)

A2 = U 2 R2 V † ,

where U1 , U2 , V are n × n unitary matrices, and R1 , R2 are
upper-triangular n × n matrices with the same real-valued,
non-negative diagonal values, namely,

The K-user Gaussian MIMO broadcast channel consists of
one transmit and K receive nodes, where each received signal
is related to the transmitted signal through a MIMO link:
y i = Hi x + z i ,
i = 1, . . . , K ,

[R1 ]ii = [R2 ]ii

∀i = 1, . . . , n .

B. Point-to-Point MIMO Scheme via Matrix Triangularization
We now review the transmission scheme known as the
uniform channel decomposition (UCD) [9], which is in turn
based upon the derivation of the MMSE version of Vertical
Bell-Laboratories Space–Time coding (V-BLAST), see, e.g.,
[10]. Later in the paper we take the triangularization to be
one which is simultaneously good for several users.
Deﬁne the following augmented matrix:4

where x is the channel input of dimensions nt × 1 subject
to an average power constraint P ;3 y i is the channel output
(i)
vector of receiver i (i = 1, . . . , K) of dimensions nr × 1; Hi
(i)
is the channel matrix to user i of dimensions nr × nt and
z i is an additive circularly-symmetric Gaussian noise vector
(i)
of dimensions nr × 1, where, without loss of generality, we
assume that the noise elements are mutually independent and
identically distributed with unit power.
The aim of the transmitter is to multicast the same (common) message to all the receivers. The capacity of this
scenario is long known to equal the (worst-case) capacity of
the compound channel (see, e.g., [6]), with the compound
parameter being the channel matrix index:
K
C {Hi }i=1 , P = max min I(Hi , Cx ) ,
(3)
Cx i=1,...,K
where I(Hi , Cx ) is the mutual information between the
channel input x and the channel output y i , obtained by taking
x to be Gaussian with covariance matrix Cx :
I(H, Cx ) log det I + Hi Cx Hi† ,

where Int is the nt × nt identity matrix.
˜
Next, the matrix G is transformed into a square matrix, by
means of the QR decomposition:
˜
G = QG ,

where Q is an (nr +nt )×nt matrix with orthonormal columns
and G is an nt × nt upper-triangular matrix with real-valued
positive diagonal elements. Now the matrix G is decomposed
according to the GMD:
G = UT V † ,

where T is upper-triangular whose diagonal values are equal
to nt det (G), which are, in turn, equal to the effective signalto-noise ratios of the scalar sub-channels.
The transmission scheme is as follows:
1) Construct nt codewords of equal rates for a scalar AWGN
channel of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nt det (G).
˜
2) In each channel use, an nt -length vector x is formed
using one sample from each codebook. The transmitted
vector x is then obtained using the following precoder:

and the maximization is carried over all admissible input
covariance matrices Cx , satisfying the power constraint.
III. BACKGROUND
In this section we recall the transmission and receiving
scheme for the single- and two-user cases, and explain how
this scheme can be generalized to the multi-user case.
A. Unitary Matrix Triangularization
The proposed scheme in this section is based on several
forms of matrix decompositions, one of which is the geometric
mean decomposition (GMD) [7]. For simplicity, we will only
consider the decomposition of square matrices throughout
this work. As we show in the sequel, this does not pose

where Q consists of the ﬁrst nt rows of Q.
4) Finally, the codebooks are decoded using successive interference cancellation, starting from the nt -th codeword
and ending with the ﬁrst one: The nt -th codeword is de˜
coded ﬁrst, using the nt -th element of y , treating the other
codewords as AWGN. The effect of the nt -th element of
˜
x is then subtracted out from the remaining elements of
˜
y . Next, the (nt − 1)-th codeword is decoded, using the
˜
(nt − 1)-th element of y — and so forth.
The optimality of this scheme, i.e., that it is capacity achieving,
was proved in [8, Sec. IV].

The scheme of Section III-B can be generalized to the Kuser case in a straightforward manner.5 However, in order to

i = 1, . . . , K ,

where N ≥ nK−1 and ∗ represents some value (which may
differ within each matrix as well as between different ones).
By using this decomposition, the same scheme as in Section III can be employed, such that the N channel uses are
effectively transformed into n N − (nK−1 − 1) equal-rate
scalar AWGN channels. The sum of the capacities of these
channels tends to the capacity of the original channel for large
values of N , where the only loss comes from edge effects
(truncation of the extreme nK − n elements).
Remark 1: For the case where the matrices have non-equal
determinants, the K-GMD Theorem 1 results in K triangular
matrices, each with a constant diagonal with entries that are
equal to n | det (Ai )|.
Remark 2: It was shown in [11, Lemma 1] that K-GMD is
equivalent to (K +1)-JET. Hence, nearly-optimal (K +1)-JET
can be obtained with the same parameters as in Theorem 1.
We provide a proof in the form of a constructive algorithm
for a special case, which demonstrates the essence for the
general case. The algorithm for the general case is available
in [12], [13] (as implementations in Matlab and Python,
respectively) and is not provided here due to space constraints.
Deﬁnition 1: Let A and B be matrices of dimensions n×m
and 2×2, respectively. We deﬁne the operation of “extraction”
of indices i and j from A by:

i = 1, . . . , K ,

is required, assuming Ai are square invertible matrices with
equal determinants (up to phase), of dimensions n × n, where
Ui are unitary matrices (corresponding to operations performed at the receivers), V is unitary as well (corresponding to
an operation performed by the transmitter) and Ti are uppertriangular matrices with constant diagonals. Unfortunately,
such a decomposition does not exist in general for more than
one matrix since there are not enough degrees of freedom
offered by the unitary matrices, as the unitary matrix on the
right, V , is the same for all decomposed matrices {Ai } (corresponding to the common operation carried at the transmitter);
for more details see [11]. To overcome this problem, in order to
gain more degrees of freedom, we propose to utilize multiple
channel uses of the same channel realization and process
them together. The idea of mixing the same symbols between
multiple channel uses has much in common with space–time
codes [4], [5]. In the next section we show how, using this
idea, nearly optimal joint triangularization may be obtained.

We now show how to utilize a space–time structure in order
to obtain nearly-optimal joint triangularization of K matrices,
such that the resulting triangular matrices have constant diagonals, up to a small portion of the diagonal extreme elements.
The resulting scheme becomes asymptotically optimal for
large values of N , where N is the number of channel uses
grouped together for the purpose of joint decomposition. This
result is stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 1 (Nearly-Optimal K-GMD): Let A1 , . . . , AK be
complex-valued n × n matrices satisfying | det(Ai )| = 1, and

For more users (larger K), the ratio between the benchmark
rate and the capacity deteriorates rapidly as K grows large.
However, the number of channel uses needed to achieve a
certain percentage of the capacity, using the approach developed in this paper, grows rapidly. Yet, based on numerical
evidence, we believe that the number of required channel augmentations can be reduced. Furthermore, for special families
of MIMO channels, very signiﬁcant reduction is possible, as
demonstrated in [14].

By taking the middle rows and columns (rows and columns

elements equaling to 1 in all three triangular matrices simultaneously.7 Formally we do so by deﬁning the next matrix which

VI. D ISCUSSION
According to Theorem 1, even when the number of users
K is not very large, a large number of channel uses need
to by combined and processed together in order to approach
the capacity. We demonstrate this phenomenon by considering
the example of the introduction (1) where the gains α and β
and the power constraint P satisfy (2), i.e., that the individual
capacities are equal.
For this case, the best achievable rate of the existing practical schemes, described in the introduction, is single-stream
beamforming, which is therefore taken to be the benchmark
which we aim to improve. Nonetheless, this scheme does not
utilize the two degrees of freedom offered by the ﬁrst channel
H1 . This becomes more signiﬁcant in the high SNR regime, in
which this benchmark rate achieves only half of the available
(multicast) capacity (3). For the proposed scheme in this paper,
we provide in Table I the number of channel uses needed to be
combined and processed together to achieve given portions of
the capacity, where for comparison, we present in the table the
benchmark rate and the rate achieved by time-sharing between
7 Over the diagonal elements which equal 1, we transmit using SISO codes,
in our proposed scheme, whereas we make no use of the remaining elements
as they may take arbitrary values.

8 Both, in the benchmark and the proposed scheme in this paper, we assume
that the scalar codes used are capacity-achieving.
