Abstract—We consider the problem of estimating a
signal corrupted by independent interference in which
the estimator (decoder) is aided by a helper (encoder)
with a limited power budget that has knowledge of the
interfering signal noncausally. In the Gaussian case, this
problem is equivalent to the problem of Assisted Interference Suppression considered by Grover and Sahai and we
obtain an improved lower bound for this problem using
Verdu’s relationship between mismatched estimation and
´
relative entropy. We also extend our analysis to consider
the case when the signal to be estimated, in addition to the
interference, is known to the helper. We establish a lower
bound that improves on those recently derived by Huang
and Narayanan.

construction site and transmit it to a noise cancellation
speaker situated in Bob’s ofﬁce. Since electromagnetic
waves travel faster than sound, the noise cancellation
speaker knows the interfering signal noncausally. Due to
a power constraint on the speaker, it cannot cancel the
interference fully. What then, is the minimum distortion
that can be achieved by Bob in trying to reconstruct
Alice’s speech?
Our setup is closely related to several strands of work
involving communication over channels with state. [1]
and [2] considered the problem of State Ampliﬁcation,
where a message is to be sent to the decoder and the den
coder also wishes to reconstruct S2 subjected to a list or
distortion constraint. This setting is similar to our setting,
with the main difference being that the decoder wishes
to reconstruct S2 instead of S1 . When our setting is specialized to the Gaussian case with the distortion measure
being the mean square error between the reconstruction
and the signal, our setting becomes equivalent to the
problem of Assisted Interference Suppression considered
in [3]. As detailed in [3], this problem is closely related
to Witsenhausen’s counterexample in Optimum Control
Theory [4]. In this paper, we focus on the following:
1) Gaussian Estimation with a helper: In the Gaussian
case, where S1 and S2 are independent Gaussian random
variables with ﬁnite variance and the distortion measure
is the mean square error, we note that our setting
is equivalent to the problem of Assisted Interference

I. I NTRODUCTION
Consider a joint source channel coding problem as
depicted in Figure 1. We have two memoryless sources
S1 (the desired signal) and S2 (the interfering signal). The decoder (or estimator)’s aim is to reconn
struct the source sequence S1 from Y n , with the
goal of minimizing the average per symbol distorˆ
tion E( n d(S1i (Y n ), S1i ))/n. The encoder (helper),
i=1
which knows the interfering signal S2 , aids the decoder
in reconstructing the signal S1 by modifying the interference through X, subject to a cost constraint ρ(X), so
as to minimize the distortion that an optimum decoder
incurs.
Potential applications for such a setting may arise
in sensor networks or cognitive radio systems. As a
motivating example, suppose Alice is talking to Bob
in his ofﬁce. As a result of ongoing construction work
near Bob’s ofﬁce, there is high interference which makes
it hard for Bob to listen to Alice. Fortunately, Bob
recently purchased a noise cancellation device which
has a microphone placed near the construction site. The
microphone measures the interfering signal from the

Suppression problem. For this setting, we give a lower
bound on the minimum achievable distortion that can
be strictly larger than the lower bound given in [3],
and its improved version given in [5]. Interestingly, the
proof of our lower bound relies on an application of
a recently established result between relative entropy
and mismatched estimation in Gaussian noise [6]. Recently, there has been interest in applying relationships
between Estimation Theory and Information Theory to
problems in Information Theory (see for e.g. [7]). Our
lower bound, which seems difﬁcult to obtain by traditional techniques such as the Entropy Power Inequality
[8, Chapter 2], provides another application of these
information-estimation relations.
2) Gaussian Estimation with a helper that knows both
the interference and the source: We also extend our
analysis to consider the related setting when the encoder
has access to S1 noncausally in addition to S2 . This
setting turns out to be a special case of a problem
considered in [9]. We give a lower bound for this setting
that contains the previous bounds in [9] and can be
strictly better than the previous bounds. Furthermore, we
also prove constant gap results between the achievable
distortion and our lower bound.
The rest of the paper is as follow. We ﬁrst provide
the formal deﬁnitions in the next section. Section III
deals with the case of Gaussian estimation with a helper
that knows only the interfering signal. Section IV deals
with the setting of Gaussian estimation with a helper
that knows both the interference and the source. Several
proofs and other results omitted from this paper are given
in the extended version [10] posted online.

A distortion D is said to be achievable if there exists a
sequence of (n, C + n ) codes, where n → 0 as n → ∞,
such that
n ˆn
lim sup E d(S1 , S1 ) ≤ D.
n→∞

The minimum achievable distortion, D(C)min , is then
deﬁned as the inﬁnum of the set of achievable distortions
under the cost constraint C.
B. Estimation with source and interference known at the
helper
This setting is shown in Figure 2 for the Gaussian
case. For this setting, As the deﬁnitions are similar to the
previous setting, we only mention the difference. That is,

Fig. 2: Gaussian estimation with a helper that knows
both the interference and the source.
For both settings, since we only consider the Gaussian
case in this paper, we assume S1 and S2 are independent Gaussian random variables, S1 ∼ N (0, P1 ) and
S2 ∼ N (0, P2 ), both known noncausally at the encoder.
The distortion measure is the mean square error between
S1 and it’s reconstruction, d(s1 , s1 ) = (s1 − s1 )2 . The
ˆ
ˆ
channel is speciﬁed by Y = X + S1 + S2 for the setting
deﬁned in subsection II-A and Y = X + S1 + S2 + Z,
where Z ∼ N (0, N ) is independent of S1 and S2
for the setting deﬁned in subsection II-B. The cost
constraint in both cases is the expected power constraint:
n
E( i=1 Xi2 /n).

II. D EFINITIONS
In this section, we give formal deﬁnitions for our
problem settings. We will follow the notation of [8],
and assume throughout this paper that the channel in
consideration is memoryless. That is, p(y n |xn , sn , sn ) =
1
2
n
n
i=1 p(yi |xi , s1i , s2i ). We also assume that S1 and
n
S2 are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
sequences.

III. I NTERFERENCE ONLY

KNOWN AT HELPER

As shown in [3], it sufﬁces to consider only P1 = 1
for this setting. We ﬁrst state a number of results without
proof.

of Gaussian estimation with a helper is given by

show that

The achievable distortion-cost region presented here
is similar to the scheme presented in [3], but we derive
it via different means in [10], where we used a hybrid

It should be noted that any γ ≥ 1 constitutes a lower
bound for D(P )min . Hence, Proposition 1 is computable
and in fact, gives a family of lower bounds.
Proof Sketch (See [10] for details): The proof
hinges on an application of a relationship between
mismatched estimation and relative entropy given in
[6, Equality 14]. The main idea behind the proof lies
in considering a decoder that performs the estimation
(and reconstruction) using a wrong (or mismatched)
n
distribution for PS1 |Y n . In particular, we will consider
n
a mismatched decoder that attempts to estimate S1
n
assuming that X ≡ 0. The estimation error incurred by
the mismatched decoder, M SEQ , is clearly larger than
that incurred by an optimum decoder that uses the correct
(true) distribution, D(P )min . We then rely on results in
[6] to lower bound the difference between D(P )min and
M SEQ , thereby giving us a lower bound on D(P )min .

Note that nD(P )min = M M SE(1). Next, using [6,

non-negative then give us our lower bound.
Proposition 1 can be generalized by using a different
mismatched distribution for X n , leading to our generalized lower bound in Theorem 3. The mismatched
distribution for X n is chosen as an i.i.d. sequence
with X = cS2 + Z, where c is any real number and
Z ∼ N (0, rP ) with r ≥ 0 and independent of S2 . Proof
is given in [10].

Theorem 3 can be strictly better than Theorem 2 for a
wide range of P . Comparisons with the improved version
of Theorem 2, reported in [5], is given in the extended
version [10].

the constraints on ρXS1 and ρXS2 are linear constraints.
Hence, we can ﬁnd the maximum value using convex
optimization. Denoting the maximum by M SE(α), we

Comparison of bounds: We let P1 = 1, N = 1 and
P = 1, and vary P2 and compare the bounds obtained
with different values of P2 . Figure 4 shows a plot of
distortion v.s. P2 for various bounds. As can be seen
from Figure 4, the lower bound given by Theorem 5
can be strictly better than that given by previous lower
bounds.
From Figure 4, we see that the upper and lower bounds
are close when P2 is large. We now state a condition
on P2 for a constant multiplicative gap of between the
