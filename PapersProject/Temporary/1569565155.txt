al. [26] introduced an additional parameter that more precisely
captures the narrowband noise error-correcting capability. This
parameter is related to symbol equity, the uniformity of frequencies of symbols in each codeword. Codes designed taking
into account this new parameter have been shown to perform
better than general ones [26].
Relatively little is known about optimal equitable symbol
weight codes, other than those that correspond to injection
codes (which include permutation codes) and frequency permutation arrays (FPAs). In particular, only six inﬁnite families
of optimal equitable symbol weight codes with code length
greater than alphabet size are known. These have all been
constructed by Ding and Yin [15], and Huczynska and Mullen
[21] as frequency permutation arrays and they meet the Plotkin
bound. One drawback with the code parameters of these
families is that the relative narrowband noise error-correcting
capability diminishes to zero as its length grows.
In this paper, we construct the ﬁrst inﬁnite families of
optimal equitable codes, whose code lengths are larger than
alphabet size and whose relative narrowband noise errorcorrecting capabilities tend to a positive constant as code
length grows. These families of codes all attain the Plotkin
bound. Our results are based on the construction of equivalent
combinatorial objects called generalized balanced tournament
designs.
Owing to space constraints, some proofs are omitted here.
These will appear in the full version of the paper.

Abstract—The use of multiple frequency shift keying modulation with permutation codes addresses the problem of permanent
narrowband noise disturbance in a power line communications
(PLC) system. Equitable symbol weight codes was recently
demonstrated to optimize the performance against narrowband
noise in a general coded modulation scheme. This paper establishes the ﬁrst inﬁnite family of optimal equitable symbol weight
codes with code lengths greater than alphabet size and whose
relative narrowband noise error-correcting capabilities do not
diminish to zero as the length grows. These families of codes
meet the Plotkin bound. The construction method introduced is
combinatorial and reveals interesting interplay with an extension
of the concept of generalized balanced tournament designs from
combinatorial design theory.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Power line communications (PLC) is a technology that
enables data transmission over high voltage electric power
lines. Started in the 1950s in the form of ripple control for
load and tariff management in power distribution, this low
bandwidth one-way communication system evolved to a twoway communication system in the 1980s. With the emergence
of the Internet in the 1990s, research into broadband PLC gathered pace as a promising technology for Internet access and
local area networking, since the electrical grid infrastructure
provides “last mile” connectivity to premises and capillarity
within premises. Recently, there has been renewed interests in
high-speed narrowband PLC due to applications in sustainable
energy strategies, speciﬁcally in smart grids (see [1]–[4]).
However, overcoming permanent narrowband disturbance
has remained a challenging problem [5]–[7]. Vinck [5] addressed this problem by showing that multiple frequency shift
keying (MFSK) modulation, in conjunction with the use of a
permutation code having minimum (Hamming) distance d, is
able to correct up to d − 1 errors due to narrowband noise.
Since then, more general codes such as constant-composition
codes, frequency permutation arrays, and injection codes (see
[8]–[23]) have been considered as possible replacements for
permutation codes in PLC. Versfeld et al. [24], [25] later introduced the notion of ‘same-symbol weight’ (henceforth, termed
as symbol weight) of a code as a measure of the capability of
a code in dealing with narrowband noise. They also showed
empirically that low symbol weight cosets of Reed-Solomon
codes outperform normal Reed-Solomon codes in the presence
of narrowband noise and additive white Gaussian noise.
Unfortunately, symbol weight alone is not sufﬁcient to capture a code’s performance against narrowband noise. Chee et

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Equitable Symbol Weight Codes
For positive integer n, denote the set {1, 2 . . . , n} by [n].
Let Σ be a set of q symbols. A q-ary code of length n over
the alphabet Σ is a subset C ⊆ Σn . Elements of C are called
codewords. The size of C is the number of codewords in C.
For i ∈ [n], the ith coordinate of a codeword u ∈ C is denoted
ui , so that u = (u1 , u2 , . . . , un ).
Denote the frequency of symbol σ ∈ Σ in codeword u ∈ Σn
by wσ (u), that is, wσ (u) = |{ui = σ : i ∈ [n]}|.
An element u ∈ Σn is said to have equitable symbol weight
if wσ (u) ∈ { n/q , n/q } for any σ ∈ Σ. If all the codewords
of C have equitable symbol weight, then the code C is called
an equitable symbol weight code.
Consider the usual Hamming distance deﬁned on codewords
and codes and let d denote the minimum distance of a code
C. Consider the following parameter.

(xv) AE (2q 2 − q, 2q 2 − 2q) = 2q for even q, q ∈ {2, 6} [21].
/
q

Deﬁnition 2.1: Let C be a q-ary code with minimum distance d. The narrowband noise error-correcting capability of
C is
c(C) = min{e : EC (e) ≥ d},

In particular, only six inﬁnite families of optimal codes
with n > q are known. However, the code parameters for
these six families are such that their relative narrowband
noise error-correcting capabilities diminish as q grows. This is
undesirable for narrowband noise correction in PLC. Hence,
Main Theorem provides the ﬁrst inﬁnite families of equitable
symbol weight codes with code lengths greater than alphabet
size and whose relative narrowband noise error-correcting
capabilities tend to a positive constant as length grows.
Our construction of optimal equitable symbol weight codes
employs tools from combinatorial design theory. The rest of
this section introduces the necessary concepts and establishes
their connections to equitable symbol weight codes.

The relative narrowband noise error-correcting capability is
then given by γ(C) = c(C)/n.
Chee et al. [26] established that a code C can correct
up to c(C) − 1 narrowband noise errors and demonstrated
that an equitable symbol weight code maximizes the quantity
c(C), for ﬁxed n, d and q. Henceforth, only equitable symbol
weight codes are considered. A q-ary equitable symbol weight
code of length n having minimum distance d is denoted
(n, d)q -equitable symbol weight code. The maximum size of
an (n, d)q -equitable symbol weight code is denoted AE (n, d).
q
Any (n, d)q -equitable symbol weight code of size AE (n, d) is
q
said to be optimal.
Taken as a q-ary code of length n, an optimal (n, d)q equitable symbol weight code satisﬁes the Plotkin bound [27].

B. Generalized Balanced Tournament Designs
A set system is a pair S = (X, A), where X is a ﬁnite set
of points and A ⊆ 2X . Elements of A are called blocks. The
order of S is the number of points in X, and the size of S
is the number of blocks in A. Let K be a set of nonnegative
integers. The set system (X, A) is said to be K-uniform if
|A| ∈ K for all A ∈ A.
A (v, k, λ)-balanced incomplete block design, or
BIBD(v, k, λ), is a {k}-uniform set system (X, A) of
order v, such that every pair of distinct points is contained
in exactly λ blocks. The size of a BIBD(v, k, λ) is λv(v−1) .
k(k−1)
A resolvable BIBD(v, k, λ), or RBIBD(v, k, λ), is a
BIBD(v, k, λ) (X, A) such that A can be partitioned into
resolution classes, each of which is a partition of X.

Theorem 2.1 (Plotkin Bound): For n, q, d such that d ≤ n
and qd > (q − 1)n, AE (n, d) ≤ qd/(qd − (q − 1)n).

In this paper, equitable symbol weight codes whose sizes
attain the Plotkin bound are constructed.
Main Theorem: Let q ≥ 2. Then the following holds.
(i) AE (2q − 1, 2q − 2) = 2q for all q ≥ 3;
q
(ii) AE (3q − 1, 3q − 3) = 3q for all q ≥ 3;
q
(iii) AE (4q − 1, 4q − 4) = 4q for all q ≥ 5, except possibly
q
when q ∈ {28, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 44};

Deﬁnition 2.2: A generalized balanced tournament design
(GBTD) is an RBIBD(km, k, λ) (X, A) whose m · λ(km−1)
k−1
blocks are arranged into an m × λ(km−1) array such that:
k−1
(i) each point appears exactly once in each column,
(ii) each point appears either λ(km−1) or λ(km−1) times
m(k−1)
m(k−1)
in each row.
We denote such a GBTD by GBTDλ (k, m).

Observe that any equitable symbol weight code C with the
above parameters must have c(C) = q − 1. It can be veriﬁed
that γ(C) tends to a positive constant as q grows. Known values
of AE (n, d) are:
q

We remark that our deﬁnition of a generalized balanced
tournament design extends that of Lamken [29], which corresponds to the case λ = k − 1 in our deﬁnition.

C. Equivalence Between Equitable Symbol Weight Codes and
GBTDs
Consider a GBTDλ (k, m) (X, A) whose rows are indexed
by [m] and columns by [n], where n = λ(km−1) . Given any
k−1
point x and any column j, there is a unique row that contains
x in column j. Hence, for each x, we correspond the codeword
c(x) = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rn ) ∈ [m]n , where rj is the row where x
appears in column j. So, C = {c(x) : x ∈ X} is a code of
length n over the alphabet [m]. Note that this correspondence
is the one used by Semakov and Zinoviev [30] to show the
equivalence between equidistant codes and RBIBDs.
For distinct points x, y ∈ X, the distance between c(x) and
c(y) is the number of columns for which x and y are not both
contained in the same row. Since there are exactly λ blocks

containing both x and y, and no two such blocks can occur
in the same column, the distance between c(x) and c(y) is
n − λ = λk(m−1) . This distance is independent of x and y,
k−1
making C equidistant.
Next, we consider the composition of c(x) for x ∈ X. From
the construction, the number of times a symbol i appears
in c(x) is the number of cells in row i that contains x.
By the deﬁnition of a GBTDλ (k, m), this number is in
{ n/m , n/m }, so C is an equitable symbol weight code.
We check that the size of C attains the Plotkin bound.
Finally, this construction of an equitable symbol weight
code from a generalized balanced tournament design can easily
be reversed. We record these observations as:

which the block it contains is disjoint from all other blocks
in the same row.
Deﬁnition 3.2: Let c be a positive integer. A c-∗colorable
RBIBD(v, 3, 1) is an RBIBD(v, 3, 1) with the property that
its v(v − 1)/6 blocks can be arranged in a v × v−1 array, and
3
2
each block can be colored with one of c colors so that
(i) each point appears exactly once in each column, and
(ii) in each row, blocks of the same color are pairwise
disjoint.
Deﬁnition 3.3: A GBTD1 (3, m) is c-∗colorable if each of
its blocks can be colored with one of c colors so that in each
row, blocks of the same color are pairwise disjoint.

Theorem 2.2: There exists a GBTDλ (k, m) if and only if
there exists a λ(km−1) , λk(m−1) -equitable symbol weight
k−1
k−1
m
code of size km. Furthermore, this code is of equitable symbol
weight and attains the Plotkin bound.

Deﬁnition 3.4: A 3-∗colorable RBIBD(v, 3, 1) is 3∗colorable with property Π if there exists a row r such that
for each color i, there exists a point (called a witness for i)
that does not appear in that row, or is not contained in any
block in that row that is colored i. A GBTD1 (3, m) that is
c-∗colorable with property Π is similarly deﬁned.

The following theorem summarizes the state-of-the-art results on the existence of GBTDk−1 (k, m).

Proposition 3.1: If an RBIBD(v, 3, 1) is 2-∗colorable, then
it is 3-∗colorable with property Π.

Theorem 2.3 (Lamken [29], [31], [32] and Yin [33]):
(i) A GBTD1 (2, m) exists if and only if m = 1 or m ≥ 3.
(ii) A GBTD2 (3, m) exists if and only if m = 1 or m ≥ 3.
(iii) A GBTD3 (4, m) exists for all m ≥ 5, except possibly
when m ∈ {28, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 44}.

A few more classes of auxiliary designs are also required.
A. Group Divisible Designs, Transversal Designs
Deﬁnition 3.5: Let (X, A) be a set system and let G =
{G1 , G2 , . . . , Gs } be a partition of X into subsets, called
groups. The triple (X, G, A) is a group divisible design (GDD)
when every 2-subset of X not contained in a group appears in
exactly one block, and |A ∩ G| ≤ 1 for all A ∈ A and G ∈ G.

Main Theorem (i)–(iii) is now an immediate consequence of Theorem 2.2 and Theorem 2.3. The existence of
GBTDλ (k, m) when λ = k − 1 has not been previously
investigated. The smallest open case is when k = 3 and λ = 1,
which we deal with here.
It follows readily from deﬁnition that a necessary condition
for a GBTD1 (3, m) to exist is that m must be odd. A quick
exhaustive computer search showed that a GBTD1 (3, 3) and
a GBTD1 (3, 5) do not exist. In fact, we have AE (4, 3) = 6
3
and AE (7, 6) = 14, which do not meet the Plotkin bound.
5
Hence, a GBTD1 (3, m) can exist only if m is odd and m ∈
/
{3, 5}. We prove that this necessary condition is also sufﬁcient.
A direct consequence of this is Main Theorem (iv). Since a
GBTD1 (3, 1) exists trivially, we focus on m ≥ 7.

We denote a GDD (X, G, A) by K-GDD if (X, A) is
K-uniform. The type of a GDD (X, G, A) is the multiset
|G| : G ∈ G . The exponential notation is sometimes used to
t t
t
describe the type of a GDD: a GDD of type g11 g22 · · · gss is
a GDD where there are exactly ti groups of size gi , i ∈ [s].
Deﬁnition 3.6: A transversal design TD(k, n) is a {k}GDD of type nk . A doubly resolvable TD(k, n), denoted
DRTD(k, n), is a TD(k, n) whose blocks can be arranged
in an n × n array such that each point appears exactly once
in each row and once in each column.

III. P ROOF S TRATEGY
Our proof of the existence of a GBTD1 (3, m) for all odd
m ≥ 7 is technical and rather complex. This section outlines the general strategy used, and introduces some required
combinatorial designs. As with most combinatorial designs,
direct construction to settle their existence is often difﬁcult.
Instead, we develop a set of recursive constructions, building
big designs from smaller ones. Direct methods are used to
construct a large enough set of small designs on which the
recursions can work to generate all larger designs.
For our recursion to work, the GBTDs must possess more
structure than stipulated in its deﬁnition. More speciﬁcally, we
consider GBTDs that are special and ∗colorable.

B. Frame Generalized Balanced Tournament Designs
Let (X, G, A) be a {3}-GDD with G = {G1 , G2 , . . . , Gs }
s
1
and |Gi | ≡ 0 mod 6 for all i ∈ [s]. Let R = 3 i=1 |Gi |
s
1
and C = 2 i=1 |Gi |. Suppose there exists a partition [R] =
s
s
i=1 Ci such that for each
i=1 Ri and a partition [C] =
i ∈ [s], we have |Ri | = |Gi |/3 and |Ci | = |Gi |/2. We say
that (X, G, A) is a frame generalized balanced tournament
design (FGBTD) if its blocks can be arranged in an R × C
array such that the following conditions hold:
(i) the cell (r, c) is empty when (r, c) ∈ Ri × Ci , i ∈ [s],
(ii) for any row r ∈ Ri , each point in X \ Gi appears either
once or twice and the points in Gi do not appear,
(iii) for any column c ∈ Ci , each point in X \ Gi appears
exactly once.

Deﬁnition 3.1: A
special
GBTD1 (3, m)
is
a
GBTD1 (3, m) such that there exists a special cell for

3

Lemma 6.1: A special GBTD1 (3, 3r q) exists for all r ≥ 0
and q ∈ Q, where Q = {q : q ≡ 1 mod 6 is a prime power}∪
{5, 9, 11, 23}, except when (r, q) = (0, 5).
Proof: Existence of a special GBTD1 (3, q) for all q ∈
Q \ {5} is provided by Proposition 5.1 and Proposition 5.2.
These GBTDs are all 3-∗colorable with property Π. The
lemma follows by considering these GBTDs as RBIBDs and
applying Corollary 4.1.

Denote this FGBTD by FGBTD(3, T ), where T = |Gi | :
i ∈ [s] .
IV. R ECURSIVE C ONSTRUCTIONS
Proposition 4.1 (Tripling Construction): Suppose there exist a 3-∗colorable RBIBD(m, 3, 1) and a DRTD(3, m). Then
there exists a 2-∗colorable GBTD1 (3, m). Furthermore, if the
RBIBD(m, 3, 1) is 3-∗colorable with property Π, then the
GBTD1 (3, m) is a special GBTD1 (3, m).

Lemma 6.2: Let s ∈ [2] and suppose there exists a TD(5 +
s, n). If 0 ≤ gi ≤ n, i ∈ [s] and that there exists a special
GBTD1 (3, m) for all m ∈ {2n + 1} ∪ {2gi + 1 : i ∈ [s]},
s
then there exists a special GBTD1 (3, 10n + 1 + 2 i=1 gi ).
Proof: By Proposition 5.3, there exists an FGBTD(3, 6t )
for all t ∈ {5, 6, 7}. By Proposition 4.4, there exists an
FGBTD(3, (6n)5 (6g1 ) · · · (6gs )). Now apply Proposition 4.2
s
to obtain a special GBTD1 (3, 10n + 1 + 2 i=1 gi ).

Corollary 4.1: Let m > 3 and suppose there exists an
RBIBD(m, 3, 1) that is 3-∗colorable with property Π. Then
there exists a special GBTD1 (3, 3k m), for all k ≥ 0.
FGBTDs can also be used to produce GBTDs with the
following recursive construction.
Proposition 4.2 (FGBTD Construction): Suppose
an
FGBTD(3, g1 g2 · · · gs ) and a special GBTD1 (3, gi + 1) for
s
i ∈ [s] exist. Then a special GBTD1 (3, i=1 gi + 1) exists.

V. D IRECT C ONSTRUCTIONS

Lemma 6.3: A special GBTD1 (3, m) exists for odd m ≥ 7.
Proof: First, a special GBTD1 (3, m) can be constructed
for odd m, 7 ≤ m ≤ 95. Details are provided in Table I.
We then prove the lemma by induction on m ≥ 97.
Let E = {t : t ≥ 9} \ {10, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38,
46, 60}. Then a TD(7, n) exists for any n ∈ E (see [35]). If
there exists a special GBTD1 (3, m ) for odd m , 7 ≤ m ≤
2n + 1, then apply Lemma 6.2 with 3 ≤ g1 , g2 ≤ n to obtain
a special GBTD1 (3, m) for odd m, 10n + 7 ≤ m ≤ 14n + 1.
Hence, take n = 9 to obtain a special GBTD1 (3, 97).
Suppose there exists a GBTD1 (3, m ) for all odd m < m.
Then there exists n ∈ E with 10n+7 ≤ m ≤ 14n+1. Suppose
otherwise. Then there exists n1 ∈ E such that 14n1 + 1 <
10n2 + 7 for all n2 > n1 and n2 ∈ E. This, together with the
fact that n1 ≥ 9, implies that n2 − n1 > 3 for all n2 ∈ E and
n2 > n1 . However, a quick check on E gives a contradiction.
Since n ∈ E and there exists a special GBTD1 (3, m ) for
all m ≤ 2n + 1 < 10n + 7 ≤ m (induction hypothesis), there
exists a special GBTD1 (3, m) and induction is complete.

We construct some small GBTDs and FGBTDs that are
required to seed the recursive constructions given in the
previous section. This section summarizes the results.

Lemma 6.3 shows that a GBTD1 (3, m) exists for all odd
m = 3, 5. Main Theorem (iv) now follows.

Corollary 4.2: If an FGBTD(3, (3g)t ) and a special
GBTD1 (3, g + 1) exist, a special GBTD1 (3, gt + 1) exists.
For Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.2 to be useful, we
require large classes of FGBTDs. We give two recursive
constructions for FGBTDs next.
Proposition 4.3 (Inﬂation): Suppose an FGBTD(3, T ) and
a DRTD(3, n) exist. Then an FGBTD(3, nT ) exists.
Wilson’s Fundamental Construction for GDDs [34] can be
modiﬁed to admit the following specialization.
Proposition 4.4 (FGBTD from Truncated TD): Suppose
there exists a TD(k + s, m), and g1 , g2 , . . . , gs are positive
integers at most m. If there exists an FGBTD(3, g t ) for each
t ∈ {k, k + 1, . . . , k + s}, then there exists an FGBTD(3, T ),
where T = (g · m)k (g · g1 )(g · g2 ) · · · (g · gs ).

Proposition 5.1: There exists a 2-∗colorable
GBTD1 (3, q) for all prime powers q ≡ 1 mod 6.

This paper establishes the ﬁrst inﬁnite families of equitable
symbol weight codes, whose code lengths are greater than
alphabet size and whose relative narrowband noise errorcorrecting capabilities tend to a positive constant as length
grows. Such codes have applications in dealing with narrowband noise over a PLC channel. The construction method
used is combinatorial and reveals interesting interplays with
an extension of generalized balanced tournament designs, ﬁrst
introduced by Lamken [29]. These have enabled us to borrow
ideas from combinatorial design theory to construct symbol
weight codes. In return, questions on equitable symbol weight
codes offer new problems to combinatorial design theory. We
expect this symbiosis to deepen.

Proposition 5.3: There exist an FGBTD(3, 6t ) for all t ∈
{5, 6, 7, 8}, an FGBTD(3, 24t ) for all t ∈ {5, 8} and an
FGBTD(3, 30t ) for all t ∈ {5, 7}.
VI. S PECTRUM OF GBTD S
In this section, we apply recursive constructions in Section
IV with small designs directly constructed in Section V to
completely settle the existence of GBTDs.
