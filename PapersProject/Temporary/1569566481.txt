Abstract—In this paper, we study the sum secure degrees of
freedom (d.o.f.) of two-unicast layered wireless networks. Without
a secrecy constraint, the sum d.o.f. of this class of networks was
studied by [1] and shown to take only one of three possible values:
1, 3/2 and 2, for all network conﬁgurations. We consider the
setting where the message of each source-destination pair must
be kept information-theoretically secure from the unintended
receiver. We show that the sum secure d.o.f. can take 0, 1, 3/2, 2
and at most countably many other positive values, which we
enumerate.

We consider a two-unicast layered network (see Fig. 1)
where two transmitters wish to have reliable and secure
communication with their respective receivers simultaneously,
by utilizing a layered network between the transmitters and
receivers. The single-layer version of this network is an
interference channel, whose capacity is unknown in general; it
is known only in certain special cases, e.g., a class of deterministic interference channels [2], a class of strong interference
channels [3]–[5], a class of degraded interference channels [6].
The degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) characterizations have been
found for the interference channel in several different settings,
e.g., [7]–[9]. In particular, the sum d.o.f. of a fully connected
interference channel is 1 [10]. The interference channel has
been studied from an information-theoretic security [11], [12]
point of view in several settings, e.g., [13], [14].
Two-unicast layered networks have been studied in [15]–
[17] where conditions to achieve only one rate pair have been
given. Recently, [1] showed that, if the source-destination
pairs are connected, with probability 1, two-unicast layered
Gaussian networks can only have three possible values for the
sum d.o.f.: 1, 3/2 or 2. To achieve this result, [1] divided all
possible network structures into ﬁve sub-classes, A, A , B, B
and C, and determined the sum d.o.f. in each case.
We extend this line of work to include security in addition
to reliability for the end-to-end users. In the ﬁrst part of this
work, we show that although for cases A and A in [1] the
sum d.o.f. is exactly 1, the sum secure d.o.f. can take values
0, 1 and at most countably many other positive values. These
values are unknown, but we provide the simplest equivalent
channel models whose sum secure d.o.f. give these values.
In the second part of this work, we propose schemes to

achieve 2 sum secure d.o.f. for cases B and B , and 3/2 sum
secure d.o.f. for case C. For most cases, some nodes perform
cooperative jamming [18] to help increase the secrecy rates of
the legitimate users. For the 2 × 2 × 2 interference network
[19], we prove that the sum secure d.o.f. is 2 and give the
corresponding achievable scheme.
In our achievable schemes, in most scenarios, we either ﬁnd
a node and utilize it to protect the communication by having
it perform cooperative jamming [18] against the unintended
receiver, or employ the real interference alignment tool [9]
to align the signals at both destination nodes in a desired
way. However, in some certain classes of layered networks,
such nodes do not exist. To overcome this problem, we use
the interference neutralization technique [20] to neutralize the
message signal at the unintended destination and even neutralize the artiﬁcial noise at the intended receiver to mimic the
wiretap channel with cooperative jamming. After discussing
all these possibilities, we note that there is still a class of
layered wireless networks in which the sum secure d.o.f. is
an open problem. Our second contribution is to ﬁnd the
simplest equivalent channel model to characterize this class
of networks. Under this classiﬁcation, once the equivalent
problem is solved, the sum secure d.o.f. of layered networks
will be resolved. The sum secure d.o.f. of this class of
networks can only take at most a countably many number
of values. Therefore, we determine the sum secure d.o.f. for
all two-unicast layered networks as countably many possible
values by utilizing these canonical networks.
II. D EFINITION AND N OTATIONS
Let V be the node set and E ⊂ V × V be the edge
set. A two-unicast layered network N = (G, L2 ) is a directed graph G = (V, E) with two source-destination pairs

L2 = {(s1 , d1 ), (s2 , d2 )} ⊂ V × V . The network has a
layered structure which means that the node set V can be
partitioned into r mutually disjoint subsets V1 , V2 , · · · , Vr such
that V1 = {s1 , s2 }, Vr = {d1 , d2 } and

G[S] induced by S, n1 (G[S]) = n2 (G[S]) = 0. By deﬁnition,
Ps1 ,d1 and Ps2 ,d2 have manageable interference.
Regarding the channel model, each node v observes the
signals through a memoryless additive Gaussian channel, i.e.,

r−1

i=1

Vi × Vi+1

Yv =

(1)

(3)

where Nv is a zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian noise and
Xu is the input signal sent from node u provided that the
edge (u, v) exists. All the channel gains hv,u in the network
are ﬁxed during the communication session and known at all
nodes. Channel gains are independently drawn from continuous distributions. For the input signal of each node u, we
assume that Xu satisﬁes an average power constraint P , i.e.,

Since each layer has an index, we deﬁne the index function
l(v) as the index of the layer containing the node v, i.e., v ∈
Vl(v) .
Next, we give several deﬁnitions on graphs.
Deﬁnition 1 (Path) A path Pv1 ,vk is an ordered set of nodes
{v1 , v2 , · · · , vk } provided that (vi , vi+1 ) ∈ E for i =
1, 2, · · · , k − 1. And, we denote u ; v if there exists at least
one path Pu,v from u to v.

n

Two paths are disjoint provided that the two sets of nodes
are disjoint. To avoid the trivial case, we always assume that
s1 ; d1 and s2 ; d2 . In addition, we cannot remove nodes v
which do not belong to any path, since we may employ them
to perform cooperative jamming.

n

t=1

Xu (t) ≤ P

(4)

where n is the total number of channel uses and Xu (t) is the
input signal sent from node u at time t.
For each source-destination pair (si , di ), the source node si
intends to transmit a message Wi from a message set Wi to the
destination node di , and keep it secure against dj 1 . For a ﬁxed
n, the number of channel uses, we assume that each node in
the network is allowed to use any encoding/decoding function.
1
For a ﬁxed but small enough > 0, the rate Ri = n log |Wi |
is achievable if the probability of decoding error at destination
di is smaller than .
The rate Ri will be the secure communication rate Rsi of
pair i if it satisﬁes the secrecy constraint, which is deﬁned as
follows: For any i = 1 or 2, the uncertainty of message Wi ,
given the observation of the other destination Ydn , is almost
j
equal to the entropy of the message, i.e.,

Deﬁnition 2 For a subset of nodes S ⊂ V , we denote by G[S]
the graph induced by S on G provided that G[S] = (S, Es )
where Es = {(v, u) ∈ E : v, u ∈ S}
Reference [1] deﬁnes interference and manageable interference as follows:
Deﬁnition 3 (Interference) For i = 1 or 2, a node v ∈ Psi ,di
/
I
causes interference on Psi ,di and we write v ; Psi ,di if there
exist a node u ∈ Psi ,di such that (v, u) ∈ E and a path Psj ,v
such that Psi ,di and Psj ,v are disjoint.

H(Wi |Ydn ) ≥ H(Wi ) − n ,
j

i = 1, 2

(5)

This deﬁnition implicitly implies that the source nodes trust
all the intermediate relay nodes, but the unintended destination
node. The sum secure d.o.f. is deﬁned as:
Rs + Rs2
Ds,Σ = lim sup sup 11
(6)
P →∞
2 log P

To characterize the interference form another pair, the number
of the nodes causing interference is deﬁned as follows:
I

ni (G[S], Psi ,di ) = ni (G[S]) = {v ∈ S : v ; Psi ,di ,
∃Psj ,v ⊂ S and Psi ,di ∩ Psj ,v = φ}

hv,u Xu + Nv
u:(u,v)∈E

(2)

where the supremum is taken over all possible encoding/decoding functions at the nodes in the network.
The sum d.o.f. of two-unicast layered networks is found as:

for some S ⊂ V and (Ps1 ,d1 ∪ Ps2 ,d2 ) ⊂ S.
Deﬁnition 4 (Manageable interference) Two disjoint paths
Ps1 ,d1 and Ps2 ,d2 have manageable interference if we can ﬁnd
S ⊂ V , such that (Ps1 ,d1 ∪ Ps2 ,d2 ) ⊂ S, n1 (G[S]) = 1 and
n2 (G[S]) = 1.

Theorem 1 (Sum d.o.f. of two-unicast network [1]) For a
two-unicast layered Gaussian network where the channel gains
are chosen according to independent continuous distributions,
with probability 1, DΣ is given by

B) 2, if N contains two disjoint paths Ps1 ,d1 and Ps2 ,d2 with

An example two-unicast layered network is shown in Fig. 1.
This network has r = 5 layers and two disjoint paths Ps1 ,d1 =
{s1 , u1 , u2 , u3 , d1 } and Ps2 ,d2 = {s2 , w1 , w2 , w3 , d2 }. Node
t1 causes interference on Ps2 ,d2 , since we can ﬁnd w2 ∈ Ps2 ,d2
such that (t1 , w2 ) ∈ E and a path Ps1 ,t1 = {s1 , t1 } such that
Ps1 ,t1 and Ps2 ,d2 are disjoint. This implies that n2 (G[V ]) = 1.
It is also easy to see that n1 (G[V ]) = 1 due to node t2 .
However, if we choose S = V \{t1 , t2 }, then, for the graph

The sum d.o.f. capacity result is DΣ = 1 for this case,
which is an upper bound for the sum secure d.o.f. To ﬁnd all
possible values of sum secure d.o.f., we ﬁrst characterize the
penultimate layer Vr−1 :
Vr−1 = G1 ∪ G2 ∪ G3 ∪ G4

• The two nodes u1 and u2 perform amplify-and-forward
with factors α1 and α2 , respectively. The values of α1
and α2 will be speciﬁed later.
• All other nodes including sj do not send/relay signals.
We construct the condensed network [1] with three key
layers as shown in Fig. 2. Then, the end-to-end transfer matrix

Since the last layer Vr only contains d1 , d2 , it is safe to remove
the nodes belonging to G4 from the network. For the rest of
this paper, we assume that the cardinality of the set G4 is zero,
i.e., |G4 | = 0.
We present our results in sub-cases with an ordered series
(A1 , A2 , · · · ), which implicitly means that Ai only contains
i−1

Meanwhile, the probability that di can decode Wi with

A. Sub-case A1 : Ds,Σ = 1 if |G2 | ≥ 1 or |G3 | ≥ 1.

Without loss of generality, we give the brief idea of the
proof for the condition |G3 | ≥ 1. There exists at least one
node u ∈ G3 . We can utilize node u to cooperatively jam d2
with average power P . Then, the last hop of the network forms
a Gaussian wiretap channel with h22 ,u P + 1 as the variance
d
of the effective noise at d2 , which implies that Ds,Σ = 1. The
same argument can be applied to |G2 | ≥ 1.

P (Ti = 0) = P (hj,j hi,i − hi,j hj,i = 0) = 1

B. Sub-case A2 : Ds,Σ = 0 if |G1 | = 1.

(13)

which means that Ds,Σ = 1 with probability one.

By our assumption, the deﬁnition of the setting A2 is A2 ∩
Ac , which is |G1 | = 1 and |G2 | = |G3 | = 0. First of all, note
1
that |G2 | = |G3 | = 0 implies |G1 | ≥ 1 due to the existence
of Psi ,di . Furthermore, if |G1 | = 1 and |G2 | = |G3 | = 0, this
indicates that Vr−1 = G1 = {u} and both edges (u, d1 ) and
(u, d2 ) exist. Then, the signals observed at d1 and d2 are the
same except a constant factor and additive Gaussian noises,
which implies that Ds,Σ must be 0.

D. Sub-case A4 : Ds,Σ = 1 if there exist two distinct nodes
u1 , u2 ∈ G1 and a node w such that w ; u1 and w ; u2 .

For this setting, we propose the following achievable
scheme:
• For a ﬁxed i, the source node si sends the message signal
to u ∈ G1 . All the nodes on the path Psi ,u relay the
signal.
• u encodes the message according to a wiretap codebook
and sends the codeword to di .
• The special node w sends pure Gaussian random noise
with average power aP to jam the destination dj through
the two nodes u1 and u2 . The linear factor a is a constant
to coordinate with the nodes in the network such that all
the output signals satisfy the power constraint. a depends
on the network topology, but not on the power P .
• All the nodes on two paths Pw,u1 , Pw,u2 relay the signals.
Nodes u1 and u2 perform amplify-and-forward with
factors α1 and α2 , respectively.

C. Sub-case A3 : Ds,Σ = 1 if |G1 | ≥ 2 and there exist two
distinct nodes u1 , u2 ∈ G1 , si ; u1 and si ; u2 for i = 1
or 2.
First, note that the combined conditions |G1 | ≥ 2 and
|G2 | = |G3 | = 0 imply that the source nodes s1 and s2 do
not belong to the layer Vr−1 , i.e, V1 = Vr−1 and r ≥ 3;
otherwise, this is not case A. The achievable scheme is based
on interference neutralization [20]:
• For a ﬁxed i, the source node si sends the message signal
to its destination.

The condensed network for the sub-case A5 .

Therefore, for networks in sub-case A5 of case A, Ds,Σ is
a positive function of |G1 |. And, Ds,Σ can only take at most
countably many values.

All other nodes including sj do not send/relay signals.
The idea here is similar to the previous sub-case. However,
we carefully choose the factors α1 and α2 to neutralize the
artiﬁcial noise at the legitimate destination di . Then, the last
hop of this condensed network is equivalent to the two-pair
one-sided additive interference channel with dependent ﬁnite
variance noise. Since the noises are independent of the input
signals, based on the fact that the secrecy capacity depends
only on the marginal distribution of Xi , Yi and Xi , Yj , we
conclude that the sum secure d.o.f. is Ds,Σ = 1.
•

IV. S UM S ECURE D.O.F. FOR C ASE A
We use the same ideas presented in Section III to analyze
the networks in case A . The results are shown in Table I.
However, there are two differences between case A and A .
In contrast to case A, for case A , we cannot conclude that
r ≥ 3 if |G1 | ≥ 2 and |G2 | = |G3 | = 0. If r = 2, this
layered network is a two-pair two-sided Gaussian interference
channel with conﬁdential messages. The sum secure d.o.f. of
this network is an open problem, and is denoted as g(0).
The other difference is that, if r ≥ 3 and none of the
conditions A1 , A2 , A3 and A4 is satisﬁed, then there are two
scenarios. If there exists node u ∈ G1 such that s1 ; u and
s2 ; u, we use the f function to characterize the sum secure
d.o.f. If such a node does not exist, which means si and sj
“connect” to different nodes in Vr−1 , then we have to deﬁne
a new function g, which also takes at most countably many
values.

E. Sub-case A5 : Ds,Σ can only be countably many positive
values for all other settings in case A.
In this last sub-case of case A, it is known that
• |G1 | ≥ 2 and |G2 | = |G3 | = 0, which implies that the
total number of the layers r ≥ 3.
r−2
• For each node w ∈ ∪i=1 Vi , there exists at most one
uw ∈ G1 such that w ; uw .
We claim that for this setting the sum secure d.o.f. could
only be a strictly positive function of the value |G1 |. Therefore,
Ds,Σ can only take at most countably many possible values.
It is easy to prove that ui = uj . We denote u = ui = uj .
Then, for each other node u ∈ G1 , u = u, we have si ; u,
˜
˜
˜
sj ; u. Besides, these u’s can only send independent signals
˜
˜
because for each node w ∈ ∪r−2 Vi there exists at most one
i=1
uw ∈ G1 such that w ; uw .
The condensed network is shown in Fig. 3(a). Due to
n
the Markov chain Wi , Wj → Yu → Ydn , Ydn , the node u
i
j
can decode the messages Wi and Wj with arbitrarily small
probability of error, which implies that Ds,Σ ≤ 1 in the ﬁrst
dashed box of Fig. 3(b). The bottleneck is the second box,
which is a brodcast channel with conﬁdential messages and M
independent helpers. Here M = |G1 | − 1. We denote the sum
secure d.o.f. capacity of this channel as f (M ). We claim that
the Ds,Σ of the original network is f (M ) = min{f (M ), 1}.
The converse is straight-forward. The achievability of the ﬁrst
box is done by time-sharing.
Finding the function f (M ) is an open problem. However,
we know its following properties:
1) f (M ) ≤ 1 for all M by deﬁnition.
2) 0 < f (1) ≤ 2 due to [21], [22].
3
3) f (M +1) ≥ f (M ) for any M . This is because the Ds,Σ
is potentially larger with one more interferer helper.

V. S UM S ECURE D.O.F. FOR C ASES B AND B
As proved in [1], for all the networks belonging to cases
B and B , we could either use a simple amplify-and-forward
scheme to make the end-to-end transfer matrix diagonal with
non-zero diagonal entries, i.e.,

or ﬁnd a 2 × 2 × 2 condensed interference sub-network in the
original layered network.
For the diagonal end-to-end transfer matrix, the operations
of the nodes in the middle layers are either performing
amplify-and-forward or keeping silent, so the effective noises
are independent of the input signals, and there is no information leakage from the source node to the unintended
destination even when the effective noises Nief f , i = 1 or
2, at di are dependent. By interference neutralization, for this
class of networks, the sum secure d.o.f. is 2.
The 2 × 2 × 2 interference channel is a cascade of two
fully connected one-hop interference channels. Reference [19]
employed interference neutralization and real interference
alignment to achieve 2 sum d.o.f. We use the same idea
to design the auxiliary random variables for the 2 × 2 × 2

values of sum secure d.o.f. The major challenge is the cases A
and A due to the fact that both destination nodes may decode
the messages. To overcome this problem, we classiﬁed layered
wireless networks into more detailed sub-cases and in almost
all the sub-cases utilized the techniques of cooperative jamming and interference neutralization to design an achievable
scheme. There is still a scenario where the result is unknown.
We provided the simplest equivalent channel models whose
sum secure d.o.f. give these values. In all other cases, we
proposed modiﬁed schemes to achieve 2 sum secure d.o.f. for
cases B and B , and 3/2 sum secure d.o.f. for case C.

interference channel, construct the channel inputs, and show
that it can asymptotically achieve 2 sum secure d.o.f. Based on
this result, for the 2×2×2 condensed interference sub-network
in the original layered network, we simply treat all nodes
except the nodes belonging to the sub-network as silent nodes
and utilize the same achievable scheme. Note that although
the equivalent interference sub-network has dependent noise
at each node, due to the fact that the noises are independent of
the message and have ﬁnite variances, the difference between
these two models will not affect the performance in terms of
the reliability and security.
Therefore, in both cases, the upper bound 2 is achievable,

VI. S UM S ECURE D.O.F. FOR C ASE C
The converse for this case is Ds,Σ ≤ DΣ ≤ 3 from [1].

The achievability without secrecy constant is given in [1].
We need to modify the achievable scheme to derive a
secrecy rate. To this end, we demonstrate our steps in Fig. 4.
In the ﬁrst mode, the source pair (s1 , s2 ) transmits (W1 , W2 )
to destination (d1 , d2 ). Clearly, Ps1 ,d1 and Ps2 ,d2 are disjoint
paths with manageable interference, i.e., case B. We can
transmit W1 to d1 and W2 to d2 securely by amplify-andforward. In the second mode, s1 transmits a new message W1
to d1 and d2 forwards the message W2 received in the ﬁrst
mode to d2 .

This scheme can achieve 2 sum d.o.f., but the messages
are not securely transmitted. The reason is that, in the ﬁrst
mode, d2 can receive a mixed signal from w, which contains
both W1 and W2 . Note that in this condensed network the
noises at each node are dependent, but have ﬁnite variances.
To transmit message W1 securely to d1 against d2 in the ﬁrst
mode: 1) Node d2 sends pure Gaussian noise with average
power P to jam the unintended receiver d2 . Signals from s2
via different paths are canceled at d1 due to the amplify-andforward scheme. 2) Since the secrecy capacity depends only
on the marginal distribution of Xs1 , Yd1 , Yd2 , with the help
of jamming from d2 , we can always design a wiretap code
achieving 1 secure d.o.f. for the condensed wiretap channel
even when the effective noises at d1 and d2 are dependent.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we studied the sum secure degrees of freedom
of two-unicast layered wireless networks. We used the setting
in [1], i.e., cases A, A , B, B and C, to explore all possible
