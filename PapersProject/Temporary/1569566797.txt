ular polynomials with linearized polynomials, and sequences of
symbols with Fq -linear span of the corresponding vectors.
In a previous work, we proposed a new family of subspace
codes that enables list-decoding, hence achieving a better tradeoff between rate and error-correction capability [7], [8]. The
idea was to evaluate all the powers of the linearized message
polynomial, up to some power L, in order to list-decode with
list size at most L. We further improved this result by introducing multiplicity in the ring of linearized polynomials [9]. This
was motivated by Guruswami-Sudan list-decoding algorithm of
Reed-Solomon codes [4].
In this paper, we introduce a new family of subspace
codes that allows a linear-algebraic list-decoding by using
s + 1-variate interpolation polynomials, where s is a design parameter. The entire list-decoding algorithm is linear-algebraic.
A system of linear equations is solved for the interpolation step
and another system is solved to compute the set of all the possible solutions which indeed is a linear space. This is motivated
by the recent work of Vadhan [15, Ch. 5] and Guruswami [2]
which suggested a simpliﬁed version, with no need of multiplicity, of previously proposed list-decoding algorithm of
folded Reed-Solomon codes by Guruswami and Rudra in [3].
In the coherent system of network coding, the network
topology and the underlying network code are known. In this
setting, with pessimistic adversarial errors, rank-metric codes
turned out to be the suitable tool to deal with possible injected
errors into the network [12]. Each codeword in a rank-metric
code is a matrix with ﬁxed dimensions whose entries are taken
from a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq . Gabidulin codes were introduced as a
class of maximum rank distance codes [1]. In this paper, we
deﬁne a folded version of Gabidulin codes. Then we propose a
list-decoding algorithm that can correct the fraction of errors
up to the Singleton bound which is the information theoretic
upper bound on the error-correction radius of a code.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We start with a
brief overview of prior work in Section II. In Section III, we ﬁrst
discuss our new construction of subspace codes, then we propose a list-decoding algorithm and establish the correctness of
the algorithm. In Section IV, we introduce the folded version of
Gabidulin codes and provide the list-decoding algorithm. Then
we show that we are able to correct the fraction of errors up to
1 − R, R being the rate of the code, hence achieving the Singleton bound on the error-correction radius of rank-metric codes.

Abstract— Subspace codes and rank-metric codes can be used
to correct errors and erasures in network, with linear network
coding. Both types of codes have been extensively studied in the
past ﬁve years.
Subspace codes were introduced by Koetter and Kschischang
to correct errors and erasures in networks where topology is unknown (the non-coherent case). In this model, the codewords
are vector subspaces of a ﬁxed ambient space; thus codes for
this model are collections of such subspaces. In a previous work,
we have developed a family of subspace codes, based upon the
Koetter-Kschichang construction, which are efﬁciently list decodable. Using these codes, we achieved a better decoding radius than
Koetter-Kschischang codes at low rates. Herein, we introduce a
new family of subspace codes based upon a different approach
which leads to a linear-algebraic list-decoding algorithm. The resulting error-correction radius can be expressed as follows: for
any integer s, our list-decoder using s + 1-variate interpolation
polynomials guarantees successful recovery of the message subspace provided the normalized dimension of errors is at most
s(1 − sR). The same list-decoding algorithm can be used to correct erasures as well as errors. The size of output list is at most
Qs−1 , where Q is the size of the ﬁeld that message symbols are
chosen from.
Rank-metric codes are suitable for error correction in the case
where the network topology and the underlying network code
are known (the coherent case). Gabidulin codes are a well-known
class of algebraic rank-metric codes that meet the Singleton
bound on the minimum rank-distance of a code. In this paper, we
introduce a folded version of Gabidulin codes analogous to the
folded Reed-Solomon codes of Guruswami and Rudra along with
a list-decoding algorithm for such codes. Our list-decoding algorithm makes it possible to recover the message provided that the
normalized rank of error is at most 1 − R − , for any > 0.
Notably this achieves the information theoretic bound on the
decoding radius of a rank-metric code.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Subspace codes have been recently introduced in order to
enable reliable communication of messages in random linear
network coding, where the topology of network is unknown to
both the transmitter and receiver [6]. This is called non-coherent
network coding. In random linear network coding, each intermediate node of the network creates a random linear combination of the packets it receives and sends it through its output
links [5]. Let the ambient space W be a vector space over a
ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq . A subspace code in W is a non-empty subset
of all the subspaces of W. Koetter-Kschischang algebraic construction of subspace codes, originally called Reed-Solomonlike codes in [6], is analogous to Reed-Solomon codes in classical block codes wherein symbols are replaced by vectors, reg-

over the ring of linearized polynomials may have exponentially
many roots, while one has to guarantee a bounded list-size at
the output of the decoder. In order to enable list-decoding, we
modiﬁed Koetter-Kschischang codes in many important ways.
Our work in [7] and [8] essentially leads to a new family of
subspace codes which are efﬁciently list-decodable, hence improving the error-correction radius upon Koetter-Kschischang
codes for a wide range of rates. For a given message polynomial fu (X), our encoder outputs the n-dimensional vector
space spanned by the vectors

In this section, we ﬁrst explain the ring of linearized polynomials. We establish some relevant terminology for subspace
codes and explain the Koetter-Kschischang algebraic subspace
codes. Then we brieﬂy recap the results of [7] and [8] which
provide a new construction of subspace codes. At the end, we
brieﬂy review rank-metric codes and Gabidulin codes as a class
of maximum rank-distance codes.
A polynomial over an extension ﬁeld Fqm of Fq is called Fq linearized if it has the following form:

⊗2
⊗L
vi = (αi , fu (αi ), fu (αi ), . . . , fu (αi ))

s
qi

f (X) =

ai X ,

for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. In this construction, we choose αi ’s in a
particular way which leads to a larger set of interpolation points
at the decoder. We refer the reader to [8] for details about the
code construction and the proposed list-decoding algorithm.

i=0

where ai ∈ Fqm , for i = 0, 1, . . . , s. Assuming that as = 0 we
say that the polynomial f (X) has q-degree s. When q is ﬁxed
i
under discussion, we will let X [i] denote X q . The main property of linearized polynomials from which they receive their
name is that they act as linear maps with respect to Fq . The set
of linearized polynomials forms a non-commutative ring under addition + and composition operation ⊗. For any two linearized polynomials f1 (X) and f2 (X), the composition operation f1 (X)⊗f2 (X) is deﬁned to be the composition f1 (f2 (X))
which is always a linearized polynomial. The ring of linearized
polynomials over Fqm is denoted by Lqm [X].

B. Rank-Metric Codes
Rank-metric codes are suitable for error correction in the coherent system of network coding when pessimistic adversarial
errors are assumed [12]. In [13], Silva et al. also show that subspace codes and rank-metric are closely related. Indeed, there is
an injective mapping between rank-metric codes and subspace
codes through a lifting operation.
n×m
Let Fq
denote the set of all n × m matrices over Fq . For
n×m
any X ∈ Fq
, let X denote the row space of the matrix X.
n×m
which is called
A rank-metric code is just a subset of Fq
n×m
is
an array code in [11]. The distance between X, Y ∈ Fq
deﬁned as rank(X − Y). We deﬁne the rate R of a rank-metric
n×m
as follows:
code C ⊆ Fq

A. Subspace Codes
Let W be a ﬁxed N -dimensional vector space over Fq and
P(W) denote the set of all subspaces of W. Let also G(W, n)
denote the set of all n-dimensional subspaces of W. A code C
in the ambient space W is a non-empty subset of P(W). A
codeword is an element of C which is in fact a subspace of W.
Deﬁnition. [6] Let C be a code associated with the ambient
space W of dimension N over Fq . Suppose that the dimension
of any V ∈ C is at most n. Then the rate of the code R is deﬁned as follows:
def logq |C|
(1)
R =
nN
Koetter-Kschischang subspace codes [6] can be regarded as
an analogous to Reed-Solomon codes. Fix m and an extension
ﬁeld Fqm of Fq . Fqm can be also regarded as a vector space of
dimension m over Fq . Fix a set A = {α1 , . . . , αn } of n linearly independent vectors in Fqm . Let u = (u0 , . . . , uk−1 )
k−1
[i]
be the message vector and fu (X) =
be the
i=0 ui X
corresponding linearized message polynomial. Then the
corresponding codeword V is the Fq -linear span of the set
{(αi , f (αi )) : 1 i n} which is an n-dimensional vector space. In this setting, erasures are considered as deletion
of vectors from the transmitted subspace V while errors are
considered as addition of linearly independent vectors to V .
Koetter and Kschischang proposed a decoding algorithm capable of correcting errors and erasures as long as the normalized
dimension of errors and erasures is at most 1 − R, where R is
the rate of the code [6].
In list-decoding Koetter-Kschischang codes, the main
obstacle is that the ring of linearized polynomials is noncommutative. Because of that, an equation of certain degree

logq (|C|)
nm
The minimum (rank) distance of C is the minimum distance
between distinct elements of C. The Singleton bound is established in the context of rank-metric codes by Gabidulin in [1].
It states that the minimum distance of a code C with rate R,
normalized by the number of rows n, when n m, is at most
1−R. A rank-metric code that meets the Singleton bound on the
minimum distance is called a maximum rank-distance (MRD)
code.
Gabidulin codes are a class of MRD codes proposed in [1].
Suppose that the input to the Gabidulin encoder is a message
vector u = [u0 u1 . . . uk−1 ] which consists of k message symbols in Fqm . Let fu (X) denote the corresponding linearized
k−1
[i]
message polynomial
i=0 ui X . Then the corresponding
codeword V is
def

R =

fu (α1 ) fu (α2 ) . . . fu (αn )

T

where the elements α1 , α2 , . . . , αn ∈ Fqm are linearly independent over Fq . Each codeword is a column vector of length
n×m
n over Fqm which can be also regarded as a matrix in Fq
.
Note that the condition n m is required. The rate of the code
is R = k/n. The minimum rank distance of a Gabidulin code
is d = n − k + 1 which satisﬁes the Singleton bound [1]. The
minimum rank distance is then normalized to 1 − R.

Lqm [X] of degree at most k − 1 that satisfy the
following equation:

III. N EW S UBSPACE C ODES AND A LGEBRAIC
L IST- DECODING T HEREOF
In this section, we present a new construction of subspace
codes and a list-decoding algorithm capable of correcting both
errors and erasures. Our results in this section are motivated by
the recent work of Vadhan [15, Ch. p] and Guruswami [2]. Then
we establish the correctness of our algorithm and compute the
error-correction radius of the proposed construction.

Q X, f (X), f (γX), . . . , f (γ s−1 X) = 0
The decoder outputs coefﬁcients of each solution f (X)
as a vector of length k.
The second step is basically solving a system of linear equations. Efﬁcient interpolation algorithms in the ring of linearized
polynomials are presented in [16]. In this case, the complexity
of corresponding interpolation algorithm is given as O(n2 s3 )
ﬁeld operations over Fqm . The parameter s is in fact a design
parameter and can be regarded as a constant. Indeed, the interpolation step is quadratic in terms of n. In the next subsection,
we explain how the message recovery step can be done using a
linear algebraic method. The complexity of the message recovery step is also quadratic. Hence, the total complexity of our
algorithm is quadratic in terms of n, the dimension of the code.

A. Code Construction and List-decoding Algorithm
The following parameters of the construction are ﬁxed: the
ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq and an extension Fqm , the number of information symbols k, the dimension of code n and the parameter s
which is related to the list size. We require that k n m. A
set A = {α1 , α2 , . . . , αn } of n linearly independent elements
of Fqm is also ﬁxed. Let γ be an element of Fqm which is not
m−1
contained in any subﬁeld of Fqm i.e. γ, γ q , . . . , γ q
are all
distinct.
Encoding Algorithm:
Formally, the encoder is a function E : Fkm → G(W, n). It acq
cepts as input a message u = (u0 , u1 , . . . , uk−1 ) ∈ Fkm . The
q
k−1
corresponding message polynomial is fu (X) = i=0 ui X [i] .
Then the corresponding codeword V is the Fq -linear span of the
set αi , f (αi ), f (γαi ), . . . , f (γ s−1 αi ) : i ∈ [n] .
Notice that, Koetter-Kschischang code is a special case of
this for s = 1. Since αi ’s are linearly independent, each codeword is an n-dimensional vector space which is a subspace of
W = α1 , α2 , . . . , αn ⊕ Fqm ⊕ · · · ⊕ Fqm

B. Recovering the Message Polynomial
As discussed in the foregoing subsection, in the last step of
the list-decoding algorithm, we need to ﬁnd all polynomials
f (X) ∈ Lqm [X] of degree at most k − 1 that satisfy
Q0 (X)+Q1 (f (X))+Q2 (f (γX))+· · ·+Qs (f (γ s−1 X)) = 0
(5)
Remark. Suppose that f, g ∈ Lqm [X] are two solutions to
the equation (5). Since Qi ’s are linearized polynomials, for any
α ∈ Fq , αf + (1 − α)g is also a solution to (5). Therefore, the
set of solutions, which can be regarded as vectors of length k
over Fqm , forms an afﬁne subspace of Fkm as a vector space
q
over Fq .
2
In the next lemma, we establish an upperbound on the number of solutions to (5). The proof of lemma also clariﬁes how
the afﬁne space of solutions can be computed with quadratic
complexity. We refer the reader to [10] for details.

(2)

s times

The dimension of W is n + sm. Each element of W is
represented as a vector with s + 1 coordinates such as
(x, y1 , . . . , ys ), where x is an element of the vector space
spanned by α1 , α2 , . . . , αn and all yi ’s belong to Fqm .
Suppose that V is transmitted and a subspace U of W of
dimension r is received. We need another parameter d at the
decoder which is computed as follows:
d=

r + s(k − 1) + 1
s+1

(3)
Lemma 1. The dimension of the afﬁne space of solutions
f (X) ∈ Lqm [X], of degree at most k − 1, to ( 5) is at most
m(s − 1).

List-decoding Algorithm:
The decoder accepts as input a vector space U which is a subspace of W. It then outputs a list of size at most q m(s−1) of
vectors in Fkm in three steps:
q
1) Computing the interpolation points:
Find a basis (xi , yi,1 , yi,2 , . . . , yi,s ), i = 1, 2, . . . , r, for
U . This is the set of interpolation points.
2) Interpolation: Construct a non-zero multivariate linearized polynomial Q(X, Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Ys ) of the form

Proof. We just sketch the proof due to space constraints
and refer the reader to [10] for a complete proof. For
i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , s, let
j

j 0

We also deﬁne the linearized polynomial P (X) and the polynomial A(X) as follows:

Q0 (X) + Q1 (Y1 ) + Q2 (Y2 ) + · · · + Qs (Ys )
where Qi ’s are linearized polynomials over Fqm , Q0 has
q-degree at most d − 1 and Qi has q-degree at most d − k,
for i = 1, 2, . . . , s, subject to the constraint that
Q(xi , yi,1 , yi,2 , . . . , yi,s ) = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , r

A(X) = q1,0 + q2,0 X + · · · + qs,0 X s−1

(4)

W.L.O.G. we assume that A(X) is a non-zero polynomial. The
i
coefﬁcient of X q in P (X), for i = 0, 1, . . . , k − 1, can be
expressed as

of size at most q m(s−1) which includes the transmitted message

(7)

Proof. Observe that (7) is in fact equivalent to the condition
on d in Corollary 4 by plugging r = n − ρ + t in the expression for d given in (3).Then by Corollary 4, E(X) is the all
zero polynomial. Therefore, the message polynomial fu (X) is
a solution to (5). There are at most q m(s−1) solutions to (5) by
Lemma 1. Therefore, the list size is at most q m(s−1) .
The ambient space W is given in (2) which has dimension
n + sm. The rate R can be computed as deﬁned in (1):

(i)

for some elements
∈ Fqm . Now, suppose that we want
to ﬁnd all possible solutions f (X) to the equation (5). Then
all the coefﬁcients of P (X) have to be equal to zero. Starting
from u0 , we compute ui ’s iteratively. For any i, suppose that
i
u0 , u1 , . . . , ui−1 are already computed. If A(γ q ) is non-zero,
then ui can be uniquely determined by (6) . Otherwise, we take
the whole Fqm as the space of solutions to ui and keep going
for each of them separately. Notice that A(X) is a non-zero
k−1
polynomial of degree s − 1 and γ, γ q , . . . , γ q
are distinct
i
elements of Fqm . Therefore, A(γ q ) is equal to zero for at most
s − 1 possible values of i. This implies that the total number of
solutions for f (X) to (5) is at most q m(s−1) which proves the
lemma.

By Theorem 5, the message is successfully recovered as long as
the normalized error-correction radius τ = (t + sρ)/n satisﬁes

In the regime where n is much smaller than ms, the bound on

C. Correctness of the Algorithm and Code Parameters
In this subsection, we ﬁrst establish the correctness of our
list-decoding algorithm. Then we compute the error-correction
radius of our code.
The particular choice of d in (3) guarantees existence of a
non-zero solution for interpolation polynomial Q that satisﬁes
(4). The proof is by counting the number of equations and variables in the system of linear equations given by (4). We refer
the reader to [10] for the details of proof. Let ρ and t denote the
dimension of erasures and errors in the received subspace U ,
respectively. Hence, the dimension of U is r = n − ρ + t.

IV. L IST- DECODING OF G ABIDULIN C ODES
In this section, we ﬁrst introduce a folded version of
Gabidulin codes. Then we propose a list-decoding algorithm
which provides error-correction radius up to the Singleton
bound 1 − R, the best possible trade-off between the rate and
error-correction radius.
Let γ be a primitive element of Fqm . Let C denote the
Gabidulin code constructed with parameters αi = γ [i−1] as
discussed in Section II-B. Let also h be a positive integer that
divides n. Then let N = n/h and M = hm.
Deﬁnition. (Folded Gabidulin Code)
The h-folded version of Gabidulin code C is a rank-metric code
N
whose codewords are elements of Fq ×M . The message polynomial fu (X) of q-degree at most k − 1 is encoded into a matrix
with the h-tuple fu (γ ih ), fu (γ ih+1 ), . . . , fu (γ (i+1)h−1 ) ,
M
which is regarded as an element in Fq , as its i-th row, for
0
i < N . The rate of the folded version of C is k/n, equal
to the rate of original code C.
2
N ×M
Let U ∈ Fq
denote the codeword corresponding to the
message polynomial fu (X). For 0 i N − 1 and 0 j
m − 1, let yi,j ∈ Fqm denote the (i, j)-th coordinate of received
N ×h
word Y regarded as a matrix in Fqm . Let t denote the rank
of error, which is also called the number of errors. Let s be a
positive integer less than or equal to h. We propose a decoding algorithm based on interpolating an s + 1-variate linearized
polynomial Q(X, Y1 , . . . , Ys ). The q-degree of Q is characterized in terms of parameter d which is set as follows:

Lemma 3. The linearized polynomial
E(X) = Q X, fu (X), fu (γX), . . . , fu (γ s−1 X)
has at least n − ρ linearly independent roots in Fqm .
Proof. The proof follows from the fact that the dimension of
V ∩ U is equal to n − ρ and each element in V ∩ U corresponds
to a root for E(X). We refer the reader to [10] for a detailed
proof.
Corollary4. If d n−ρ, then the linearized polynomial E(X)
is identically zero.
Proof. The q-degree of fu (X) is at most k − 1. Therefore, the
q-degree of Qi ⊗ fu (γ i−1 X) is at most
d−k+k−1=d−1
for i = 1, . . . , L. Also, the q-degree of Q0 (X) is at most d − 1.
Thus the q-degree of E(X) is at most d − 1. On the other hand,
E(X) has at least n−ρ linearly independent roots by Lemma 3.
Therefore, E(X) must be the all zero polynomial.

d=

If we let both s and h grow large while s is much smaller that
h, we get decoding radius arbitrary close to 1 − R, while the
unique decoding radius bound is equal to (1−R)/2. Notice that
1−R is indeed equal to the normalized minimum rank-distance
of the code. We are able to achieve the ultimate error-correction
radius for rank-metric codes, as stated in the following theorem.

Q0 (X) + Q1 (Y1 ) + Q2 (Y2 ) + · · · + Qs (Ys )
where Qi ’s are linearized polynomials over Fqm , Q0 has
q-degree at most d − 1 and the q-degree of all other Qi ’s
is at most d − k, subject to the constraint that
Q(γ ih+j , yi,j , yi,j+1 , . . . , yi,j+s−1 ) = 0
for i = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1 and j = 0, 1, . . . , h − s.
2) Message recovery: Find all the solutions f (X)
Lqm [X] to the following equation:
Q X, f (X), f (γX), . . . , f (γ s−1 X) = 0

(10)

Theorem 9. For every > 0 and 0 < R < 1, there is a family
of folded Gabidulin codes with rate R that can be list-decoded
up to normalized number of errors 1 − R − . The size of output list is at most QO(1/ ) , where Q is the size of the ﬁeld that
message symbols are chosen from.

(11)

The decoder outputs coefﬁcients of each solution f (X)
as a vector of length k.
The decoding steps can be done similar to the steps of the
list-decoding algorithm discussed in Section III-A in quadratic
complexity in terms of dimension n.
Next, we establish correctness of the proposed list-decoding
algorithm and compute the error-correction radius.
The particular choice of d in (9) guarantees existence of a
non-zero solution for interpolation polynomial Q that satisﬁes
(10). The proof is by counting the number of equations and variables in the system of linear equations given by (10). We refer
the reader to [10] for the details of proof.

Proof. Given R and , we can apply the result of Theorem 8
with the choice s = 1/2 and h = 1/4 2 .

Lemma 6. There are at least (N − t)(h − s + 1) linearly independent roots in Fqm for the linearized polynomial
E(X) = Q X, fu (X), fu (γX), . . . , fu (γ s−1 X)
Proof. The proof follows from the fact that the dimension of
U ∩ Y is N − t and each element in U ∩ Y corresponds
to h − s + 1 roots for E(X). We refer the reader to [10] for a
detailed proof.
Corollary7. If d
equal to zero.

(N −t)(h−s+1), then E(X) is identically

Proof. The proof is very similar to the proof of Corollary 4.
The q-degree of E(X) is at most d − 1 by the same argument.
E(X) has at least (N − t)(h − s + 1) linearly independent roots
by Lemma 6. Thus, E(X) must be the all zero polynomial.
Theorem 8. If the number of errors, t, is bounded as
Ns
h
t<
1−
R
(12)
s+1
h−s+1
then the proposed list-decoding algorithm of folded Gabidulin
codes is correct i.e. it outputs a list of size at most q m(s−1)
which includes the transmitted message u.
Proof. Observe that (12) is indeed equivalent to the condition
on d in Corollary 7, if we plug in d form (9) and use the approximation R = (k − 1)/n. Then by Corollary 7, E(X) is the all
zero polynomial. Therefore, the message polynomial fu (X) is
a solution to (11). There are at most q m(s−1) solutions to (11)
by Lemma 1. Therefore, the list size is at most q m(s−1) .
