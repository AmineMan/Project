Abstract—We consider the problem of lossy communication of
correlated sources over multiple access channels with noiseless
causal feedback. A sufﬁcient condition for lossy transmission is
presented, which generalizes several previous results on communication over multiple access channels, recovering as special cases
channel coding results by King, Cover, and Leung, and extending
a previous sufﬁcient condition for lossless communication by
Cover, El Gamal, and Salehi. The proposed coding scheme
is based on a recently developed analog-digital hybrid coding
scheme for joint source–channel coding combined with blockMarkov coding.

Communication of a 2-DMS over a DM-MAC with noiseless
feedback.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We study the problem of lossy communication of two
correlated discrete memoryless sources (2-DMS) (S1 , S2 ) over
a discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (DM-MAC)
(X1 × X2 , p(y1 , y2 |x), Y) with noiseless causal feedback (see
Fig. 1). Here each separate encoder observes the feedback
from the channel output of the previous time instants as well
as one of the two source components, which it wishes to
communicate to the common receiver so that two functions
of the sources can be reconstructed with desired distortions
D1 and D2 . This problem models communication scenarios
where spatially separated senders cooperate in transmitting
correlated information over a shared medium and serves as
a building block to study the tradeoff between cooperation
and competition among users in more general communication
settings.
The formal deﬁnition of the problem is as follows. A
(|S1 |n , |S2 |n , n) joint source–channel code consists of
• two encoders, where at time i ∈ [1 : n] encoder j = 1, 2
assigns a symbol xj,i (sn , y i−1 ) ∈ Xj to each sequence
j
n
sn ∈ Sj and past received output sequence y i−1 ∈ Y i−1 ,

and
ˆn
ˆn
• a decoder that assigns an estimate (ˆn , sn ) ∈ S1 × S2

to each sequence y ∈ Y .
Let d1 (s1 , s1 ) and d2 (s2 , s2 ) be two distortion measures.

The average per-letter distortion dj (sn , sn ), j = 1, 2, is

deﬁned as d(sn , sn ) = (1/n) i=1 d(sji , sji ). A distortion
j
pair (D1 , D2 ) is said to be achievable for communication
of the 2-DMS (S1 , S2 ) over the DM-MAC p(y|x1 , x2 ) with
feedback if there exists a sequence of (|S1 |n , |S2 |n , n) joint
source–channel codes such that
ˆ
lim sup E(dj (S n , S n )) ≤ Dj , j = 1, 2.

Encoder 1

The optimal distortion region is deﬁned as the closure of the
set of all achievable distortion pairs (D1 , D2 ). A computable
characterization of the optimal distortion region is not known
in general.
Special instances of this problem have been previously studied in the literature. Ong and Motani [1] studied the lossless
communication problem where the receiver is interested in
reconstructing the sources with vanishing error probability and
derived sufﬁcient conditions for reliable transmission. Lapidoth and Tinguely analyzed the problem of sending a bivariate
Gaussian source over a Gaussian multiple access with feedback under quadratic distortion measures [2] and characterized
tight scaling results in the limiting regimes of low and high
signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios. King [3] investigated the special
case where S1 = (W0 , W1 ) and S2 = (W0 , W2 ), where W0 ,
W1 , and W2 are three mutually independent random variables
of entropies R0 , R1 , and R2 , respectively. In this case, the
set of triples (R0 , R1 , R2 ) that can be reliably transmitted
is referred to as the feedback capacity region of the DMMAC. Assuming that the entropy of R0 is zero, Ozarow [4]
characterized the feedback capacity of a Gaussian MAC with
feedback, while Cover and Leung [5] established an inner
bound on the feedback capacity of a general DM-MAC which
is suboptimal in general [4], [6], [7] but tight for a special
class of channels [8]. Finally, an inner bound to the optimal
distortion region in the case where there is no output feedback
was derived in [9].
In this paper, we develop an inner bound on the optimal
distortion region for general multiple access channels with
feedback. This inner bound generalizes the result by Lim et
al. [9] to the case where the sources have a common part –

j

source (S1 , S2 ) as well as for coherently communicating over
the DM-MAC. To illustrate the role played by U0 , consider
the following two extreme cases:
a) Degraded “source” set problem: On the one hand, consider the degraded “source” set problem where encoder 1 has
access to both source sequences. This setup can be captured
˜ ˜
by considering transmission of a source (S1 , S2 ) such that
˜1 = (S1 , S2 ), S2 = S2 . For this problem, the sufﬁcient
˜
S
condition in Theorem 1 is also necessary.

in the sense of Gács–Körner [10] and Witsenhausen [11] –
and noiseless output feedback is available at the transmitters,
and the result by Ong and Motani [1] to the case of lossy
communication. When we specialize our result to the problem studied by Lapidoth and Tinguely, the proposed coding
scheme achieves the optimal scaling results characterized
in [2]. The achievable region that we obtain includes the
feedback capacity inner bounds by King [3] and by Cover
and Leung [5]. However, in the special of case of the Gaussian
MAC, our inner bound does not achieve the feedback capacity
characterized by Ozarow [4]. Two special cases of channels
and sources for which our approach leads to tight conditions
are presented. The associated coding scheme is based on the
analog-digital hybrid coding scheme for joint source–channel
coding proposed in [9], [12]. The novelty of our construction
lies in combining hybrid coding with a block-Markov coding
similar to the one used in the analysis of the Cover and Leung’s
inner bound [13].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next
section, we present the main result of the paper and its
relationship with existing results in the literature. A sketch of
the proof of the main coding theorem is given in Section III.
Section IV concludes the paper. Throughout the paper, we use
the notation in [13].
II. M AIN
We establish the following:

Corollary 1: A distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) is achievable for
˜ ˜
communication of the degraded source 2-DMS (S1 , S2 ) over
a DM-MAC p(y|x1 , x2 ) with noiseless feedback if
ˆ
ˆ
I(S1 ; S1 | S2 ) < I(X1 ; Y |X2 ),
ˆ ˆ
I(S1 , S2 ; S1 , S2 ) < I(X1 , X2 ; Y ),
for some pmf p(ˆ2 |s2 )p(ˆ1 |s1 , s2 )p(x1 , x2 ). Conversely, if a
s
s
distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) can be achieved, then the above inequalities with “<” replaced by “≤” have to be simultaneously
satisﬁed for some p(ˆ2 |s2 )p(ˆ1 |s1 , s2 )p(x1 , x2 ).
s
s
Proof: For the proof of the direct part, take U0 =
ˆ
ˆ
(S2 , X2 ), U1 = (S1 , X1 ), and U2 = ∅ in Theorem 1 for
some joint pmf p(ˆ2 |s2 )p(ˆ1 |s1 , s2 )p(x1 , x2 ). The proof of
s
s
the converse follows from standard techniques and therefore
it is not reported here.

RESULT

Notice that in the proof of Corollary 1 U0 is chosen equal
ˆ
ˆ
to two codewords S2 and X2 . S2 is used by the senders to
jointly compress the common source S2 , while X2 is used to
cooperatively communicate the (digital) compression index to
the receiver. In this case, the special structure of the source
allows the senders to fully cooperate and so the channel output
feedback is useless. It is easily veriﬁed, in fact, that the
sufﬁcient condition in Corollary 1 can be directly obtained
from the coding scheme in [9], which does not make use
of channel feedback. This shows that in this case feedback
does not enlarge the set of achievable distortion pairs for
communication over a MAC.
b) Independent sources: On the other hand, consider the
special case where the sources S1 and S2 are independent
and the DM-MAC belongs to the class of multiple access
channels considered by Willems [8], in which one channel
input is a deterministic function of the channel output and the
other channel input. For this problem, the sufﬁcient condition
in Theorem 1 is also necessary.

Theorem 1: A distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) is achievable for
communication of the 2-DMS (S1 , S2 ) with common part K
over a DM-MAC p(y|x1 , x2 ) with noiseless feedback if
I(U1 ; S1 |U0 , U2 ) < I(U1 ; Y |U0 , U2 ),
I(U2 ; S2 |U0 , U1 ) < I(U2 ; Y |U0 , U1 ),
I(U0 , U1 , U2 ; S1 , S2 ) < I(U0 , U1 , U2 ; Y ).
for some pmf p(u0 |k)p(u1 |s1 , u0 )p(u2 |s2 , u0 ), two encoding functions x1 (s1 , u0 , u1 ), x2 (s2 , u0 , u2 ), and two decoding functions s1 (u0 , u1 , u2 , y) and s2 (u0 , u1 , u2 , y) such that
ˆ
ˆ
ˆ
E(dj (Sj , S j )) ≤ Dj , j = 1, 2.
A few remarks are in order. The inequalities that appear
in Theorem 1 have a natural interpretation – the terms at the
left-hand side denote the rates at which the source (S1 , S2 )
is compressed (described) by the codewords U0 , U1 , and U2 ,
while the terms at the right-hand side denote the rates at which
these codewords are communicated over the channel. Thus,
Theorem 1 states that a distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) is achievable
if the source compression rates do not exceed the channel
communication rates. At a high level, a similar condition
can also be obtained by performing separate source-channel
coding, by concatenating, for instance, the distributed source
coding scheme in [14] with the channel coding scheme in [3].
The main difference with the separation-base approach is that
here the same codewords U0 , U1 , and U2 are used for both
source coding and channel coding.
In Theorem 1, the codeword U0 is available at both senders
and is used for jointly compressing the common part K of the

Corollary 2: A distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) is achievable for
communication of the 2-DMS (S1 , S2 ) over a DM-MAC
p(y|x1 , x2 ) in the class studied in [8] and with noiseless
feedback if
ˆ
ˆ
I(S1 ; S1 | S2 ) < I(X1 ; Y |U, X2 ),
ˆ
ˆ
I(S2 ; S2 | S1 ) < I(X2 ; Y |U, X1 ),

I(S1 , S2 ; S1 , S2 ) < I(X1 , X2 ; Y ).

Conversely, if a distortion pair (D1 , D2 ) can be

2

for some pmf p(q)p(x1 |q)p(x2 |q). It can be shown that this
inner bound achieves capacity for the class of multiple access
channels studied by Willems in [8]. Moreover, by setting
R0 = 0 we recover the inner bound of Cover and Leung [5]
for the problem of reliable communication of two independent
messages over a DM-MAC with feedback. We remark, however, that the resulting region does not include the inner bounds
derived by Bross and Lapidoth [6] and by Venkataramanan
and Pradhan [7], which strictly outperform the inner bound
by Cover and Leung, as well as the result by Ozarow for the
Gaussian MAC with feedback [4].
Finally, when we can specialize Theorem 1 to the problem
of transmitting a Gaussian source over a Gaussian MAC with
feedback under mean-square distortion, we recover the low
and high SNR scaling results derived in [2]. On the one
hand, Lapidoth and Tinguely proved that at low SNR uncoded
transmission is optimal. We can recover this result by setting
in Theorem 1 the encoding function x1 (x2 ) proportional to s1
(s2 ) and the decoding function s1 (ˆ2 ) equal to the minimum
ˆ s
mean-square estimate of s1 (s2 ) given y. On the other hand,
they showed that at high SNR the source-channel separation
scheme obtained concatenating the Gaussian multiterminal
source coding scheme in [19], [20] with the channel coding
scheme by Ozarow is asymptotically optimal. It can be shown
that the same asymptotic performance can also be obtained
after replacing the Ozarow’s scheme with the (continuousalphabet version of the) scheme by Cover and Leung, and
thus it can be achieved by Theorem 1 .

achieved, then the above inequalities with “<” replaced
by “≤” have to be simultaneously satisﬁed for some
p(ˆ1 |s1 )p(ˆ2 |s2 )p(u)p(x1 |u)p(x2 |u).

s
Proof: For the proof of the direct part, take U0 = U ,
ˆ
ˆ
U1 = (S1 , X1 ), and U2 = (S2 , X2 ) in Theorem 1 for some
joint pmf p(ˆ2 |s2 )p(ˆ1 |s1 )p(u)p(x1 |u)p(x2 |u). The proof of
s
s
the converse follows by application of [15, Theorem 2] and [8],
but it can also be proved directly using standard converse
techniques.
In this case, the sources are independent and so cooperation
between the senders can only take place at the channel-coding
level, through the channel output feedback, while the sourcecoding has to be performed in a distributed manner. In the
proof of Corollary 2 notice that U0 is chosen independent of
the sources and is only used to induce coherent transmissions
over the channel, exactly as in the channel coding scheme
in [5]. It should also be remarked that the same sufﬁcient
condition can be obtained by separately performing source and
channel coding, ﬁrst compressing the sources using the distributed source coding scheme by Berger [16] and Tung [17]
and then encoding the resulting sequences using the channel
coding scheme for the DM-MAC with feedback in [5].
When specialized to the lossless case, wherein d1 and
d2 are Hamming distortion measures and D1 = D2 = 0,
Theorem 1 yields the following sufﬁcient condition for lossless
communication of a 2-DMS over a DM-MAC with feedback:
Corollary 3: A 2-DMS (S1 , S2 ) with common part K can
be communicated losslessly over a DM-MAC p(y|x1 , x2 ) with
noiseless feedback if

The coding scheme used for the proof of achievability in
Theorem 1 uses the hybrid coding technique for joint sourcechannel coding proposed in [9], [12], combined with a block
Markov coding technique. We provide here a sketch, while
the full prove can be found in the extended version of this
paper [21]. Coding is performed in blocks of n transmissions.
Within each block, the senders select a codebook to use for
hybrid coding based on the received channel output feedback
in the previous block. Decoding is performed using backward
decoding starting from the last transmission block. At a high
level, the sufﬁcient condition is obtained combining the conditions for distributed source encoding with those for channel
decoding. Speciﬁcally, in each block the source encoding
operation is successful if

H(S1 |S2 ) < I(X1 ; Y |X2 , S2 , Q),
H(S2 |S1 ) < I(X2 ; Y |X1 , S1 , Q),
H(S1 , S2 ) < I(X1 , X2 ; Y ),
for some pmf p(q)p(x1 |s1 , q)p(x2 |s2 , q).
Proof: Take U0 = (K, Q), Uj = (Xj , Sj ), and
sj = sj , j = 1, 2, in Theorem 1 under the distribution
ˆ
p(q)p(x1 |s1 , q)p(x2 |s2 , q).
Corollary 3 generalizes the sufﬁcient condition derived by
Cover, El Gamal, and Salehi [18] for lossless communication
of correlated sources over a DM-MAC to the case where
noiseless feedback is available at the encoders.
We can further specialize the result in Corollary 3 to
the channel coding problem studied by King [3] where
S1 = (W0 , W1 ) and S2 = (W0 , W2 ), with H(Wj ) = Rj ,
j = 0, 1, 2. By choosing (X1 , X2 ) to be independent of
(W0 , W1 , W2 ), Corollary 3 yields King’s inner bound [3] to
the capacity region, which states that a rate triple (R0 , R1 , R2 )
is achievable if it satisﬁes

R0 > I(U0 ; S1 , S2 ),
R1 > I(U1 ; S1 |U0 ),
R2 > I(U2 ; S2 |U0 ),
while the channel decoding operation across two consecutive
blocks is successful if

R1 < I(X1 ; Y |X2 , Q)
R2 < I(X2 ; Y |X1 , Q)
R0 + R1 + R2 < I(X1 , X2 ; Y )

R1 < I(U1 ; Y, U2 |U0 ),
R2 < I(U2 ; Y, U1 |U0 ),

all i ∈ [1 : n].

Theorem 1 is then established by eliminating the intermediate rate triple (R0 , R1 , R2 ) from the above inequalities and by simplifying the resulting inequalities using the fact that the underlying joint pmf factorizes as
p(u0 |k)p(u1 |s1 , u0 )p(u2 |s2 , u0 ). We remark that the derivation of the conditions for channel coding requires the use
of a technique developed in [9] to deal with the dependency
between the transmitted messages and the codebook. In the remaining of this section, we ﬁrst describe the random codebook
generation and encoding/decoding scheme, then we outline the
analysis of the probability of error.

Decoding: Decoding at the receiver is done by
backward decoding after b blocks are received. For
j ∈ [b : 1], the decoder ﬁnds the unique index
triple (m0,j , m1,j , m2,j−1 ) such that un (m0,j , m2,j−1 ),

Codebook generation: Fix ǫ > ǫ′ > 0 and a pmf
p(u0 |k) p(u1 |u0 , s1 ) p(u2 |u0 , s2 ), two encoding functions
x1 (s1 , u0 , u1 ) and x2 (s2 , u0 , u2 ), and two reconstruction
functions s1 (u0 , u1 , u2 , y) and s2 (u0 , u1 , u2 , y). As in block
ˆ
ˆ
Markov coding, we randomly and independently generate a
codebook for each block. For j ∈ [1 : b], randomly and independently generate 2n(R0 +R2 ) sequences un (m0,j , m2,j−1 ),
0
m0,j ∈ [1 : 2nR0 ] and m2,j−1 ∈ [1 : 2nR2 ], each acn
cording to i=1 pU0 (u0i ). For each (m0,j , m2,j−1 ), randomly
and conditionally independently generate 2nR1 sequences
un (m1,j |m0,j , m2,j−1 ), m1,j ∈ [1 : 2nR1 ], each according

to i=1 pU1 |U0 (u1,i |u0,i (m0,j , m2,j−1 )) and 2nR2 sequences

Analysis of the probability of error: We bound the distortion

averaged over (S1 (j), S2 (j)), the random codebook, and the
random index assignments at the encoders. Let M0,j , M1,j ,
and M2,j be random variables denoting the chosen indixes at
the encoders in block j ∈ [1 : b]. Deﬁne the “error” event:

m2,0 = 1. If there is more than one such index, it chooses
one of them at random1. If there is no such index, it
chooses an arbitrary index at random from [1 : 2nR0 ].
Next, it ﬁnds an index m2,j ∈ [1 : 2nR2 ] such that

Next, consider E3 (j), i.e., the event that encoder 1 fails
in decoding the message M2,j−1 transmitted by encoder 2
in block j − 1. Combining similar steps as in the analysis
of hybrid coding [9] with those in the analysis of multi-hop
coding for the relay channel [13], it can be shown that the
probability of decoding error for encoder 1 at the end of block
j − 1 goes to zero as n → ∞ if
R2 < I(U2 ; Y, U1 |U0 ) − δ(ǫ).

question that is leitmotif of our future research is how to resolve the tradeoff between competition and cooperation among
separated senders in a network. This tradeoff is currently fully
understood only in few special cases of sources and channels.

Since by assumption M2,0 = 1, by forward induction
P{E3 (j)} → 0 as n → ∞ for every j ∈ [1 : b] if (6) is
satisﬁed.
Similarly, by combining the hybrid coding analysis with the
analysis of backward decoding [13], it can be shown that the
probability of E4 (j), i.e., the event that the decoder fails in
decoding the messages M0,j , M1,j , and M2,j−1 , goes to zero
as n → ∞ if (6) is satisﬁed as well as
R1 < I(U1 ; Y, U2 |U0 ) − δ(ǫ),

(7)

R0 + R1 + R2 < I(U0 , U1 , U2 ; Y )
+ I(U1 ; U2 |U0 ) − δ(ǫ).

and

By convention M2,b+1 = M0,b+1 = M1,b = 1, so by
backward induction P{E4 (j)} → 0 as n → ∞ for every
j ∈ [1 : b] if (6), (7), and (8) are satisﬁed. Finally, by the
c
c
Markov lemma [13], P(E5 (j) ∩4 Ek (j) ∩ E4 (j + 1)) → 0 as
k=0
n → ∞.
It follows if conditions (3)-(8) are satisﬁed for some
(R0 , R1 , R2 ), then each term in (2) tends to zero as n → ∞
and thus the probability of “error” in each block j tends to
zero as n → ∞. By the law of total expectation and the typical
average lemma, it then follows that
ˆ
lim sup E(d(Sln (j), Sln (j)))
n→∞

ˆ
≤ lim sup P(E(j)) E(d(Sln (j), Sln (j))|E(j))

+ P(E(j)c ) E(d(Sln (j), S l (j))|E(j)c )
ˆ
≤ (1 + ǫ) E(d(Sl (j), S l (j))),
for l = 1, 2, and hence the average distortion over the random
codebooks generation and index assignment can be bounded
as desired. Thus, there exists at least one sequence of codes
achieving the desired distortion.
IV. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we considered the problem of lossy communication over multiple access channels with feedback. By
combining the recently proposed analog-digital hybrid coding
scheme for joint source-channel coding [9], [12] with block
Markov coding, we presented an inner bound to the optimal
distortion region which was shown to include and generalize
several existing results in the literature. The fundamental
