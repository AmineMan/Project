and information theory, most of works are dedicated to the
analysis of exponent (1). Two of the important exceptions are
the error probability of the random codes below the critical
rate [5] and the expected number of codewords of low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes [6]. In both cases, the central
approximation [7] is essentially used instead of Laplace’s
method. This paper reﬁnes our previous result [3], and shows
the usefulness of the central approximation combined with the
method of types for many models in statistical physics and
information theory.

Abstract—In statistical physics and information theory, while
asymptotic behavior of the partition function is often of our
primary interest, the most of works are dedicated to analysis
of the exponent of the partition function. In our previous
paper on sparse random factor graph ensembles, we show that
the exponent of the expectation of the partition function is
represented as the minimum of the Bethe free energy of the
small averaged graph by using the method of types. In this
paper, we present a general framework to study more precise
asymptotic behaviors of the partition function, using the central
approximation in conjunction with the method of types.

II. N OTATIONS AND U SEFUL EQUATIONS

In information theory and statistical physics, we often face
the problem of analyzing a sum of the form
Z=

∑

Let A(a, b) be the (a, b) element of a matrix A. Let In be
the identity matrix of size n. Let At be the transpose of A.
Let |X | be the cardinality of a set X . Let Dg and D2 g be
the gradient and the Hessian matrix of a function g. Let z
be the L2 norm of z. Let H(ν) denote the entropy function
− ∑x∈X ν(x) log ν(x) of a probability measure ν on X . The
following lemmas are used in this paper.

A(x)

x∈X N

where A(x) is a non-negative function of x ∈ X N which
is often factorized to local contributions of x. In statistical
physics, Z is called a partition function. We also deal with
this quantity in context of information theory [1], [2]. In both
of statistical physics and information theory, we are mainly
interested in the exponent of Z, i.e.,
Z = eNF+o(N)

A and m × n matrix B,
det(In + AB) = det(Im + BA).

or equivalently F := limN→∞ (1/N) log Z. We often assume
randomness in the partition function, and consider two types
of exponent, the annealed free energy limN→∞ (1/N) log E[Z]
and the quenched free energy limN→∞ (1/N)E[log Z] where
E[·] denotes the expectation. In that case, we ﬁrst consider
the annealed free energy since the quenched free energy is
‘obtained’ from the annealed free energy by using the nonrigorous replica method. In order to obtain the annealed
free energy, while statistical physicists have proposed various
techniques, we have found that the method of types provides a
general and intuitive approach [3]. For obtaining the annealed
free energy in this approach, Laplace’s method is used after
the classiﬁcation of X N according to the types of assignments
on factor graphs [4].
In this paper, we consider a more precise analysis of E[Z]
which is exact up to a constant factor, i.e.,
E[Z] = eNF C(N)(1 + o(1))

Let X R be a ﬁnite set. In this section, without specifying any details, we study the following generic “partition

power of a partition function of a certain dense model:

special cases various models often studied in statistical physics
and information theory, e.g., the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)
model [1], random matrices [8], code-division multiple-access
channels [2], etc. By using the method of types, one obtains [9]

B. The replica symmetry assumption and n → 0
In the replica theory, we often assume the RS assumption,
i.e., ν ∗ (x) is invariant under permutations of the n variables
in x ∈ X n . In this section, for simplicity, it is assumed that
the alphabet is X = {+1, −1}. The matrices D2 g, U and U
can thus be reduced to n(n − 1)/2 × n(n − 1)/2 matrices since
x(a) x(a) = 1 always holds. It is known that D2 g and U − U
share the same eigenspaces [10], [2]. Let A be the n(n−1)/2×
n(n − 1)/2 matrix with elements

P,
if |{a, b} ∩ {c, d}| = 2

A((a, b), (c, d)) = Q, if |{a, b} ∩ {c, d}| = 1

Both U −U and D2 g are of this form on the RS assumption.

fact, the factor C(N) in this case does not depend on N, and
is obtained via the central approximation [7].

where the variables q, r, P, Q and R are to be determined

SK model where P = β 2 , Q = R = 0, in the paramagnetic
phase β < 1 where q = r = 0, the ﬁnite-size correction term
is (1/(4N)) log(1 − β 2 ). This result is known in [11]. For
SK model, at the critical temperature β = 1, eigenvalues
of the Hessian include zero. For β > 1 where the full-step
replica symmetry breaking must be considered, the Hessian
also includes zero eigenvalue. Hence, for β ≥ 1, the second
derivative analysis is not sufﬁcient and the analysis of third
or higher-order derivative is needed [7]. For β = 1, the results
are partially obtained in [11].

C. Proof
The proof of Theorem 3 is the same as the ordinary proof
using the saddle point method [7]. Let α ∈ (1/2, 2/3). The
equations for deriving Theorem 3 are on the next page. The
asymptotic equality A ∼ B means that A = B(1 + o(1)). From
continuity of f and g, the assumption of unique maximum, and
α > 1/2, the sum for (x) − Nν ∗ (x) > N α is asymptotically
negligible [7]. From α < 2/3, the approximation in Lemma 2
and the second-order expansion of g are used in (7) and (8),
respectively. In (9), the ﬁrst-order factor is removed from the
optimality of {ν ∗ (x)}. In (10), the Riemann integral formula is
used. In the next equality, the Gaussian integral is performed.

a local limit theorem also holds although it is not explicitly

In this section, we deal with the random regular factor graph
ensembles. The calculation of the exponent of the partition
function using the method of types is proposed in [3] while
the basic idea of the type of factor graph is mentioned in [4].
In this section, similarly to the previous section, the central
approximation is used for deriving the constant factor.
A factor graph is a bipartite graph consisting of variable
nodes and factor nodes, deﬁning a probability distribution

the probability distribution of the joint empirical distribution

node degrees of some regular factor graph ensemble. The
random connection of edges is chosen uniformly from the
(Nl)! possible connections. Let E[·] denote the expectation on
random connection of edges. Let variable-type denote the
type of variable nodes, i.e., there exists (x) variable nodes of
value x ∈ X . Let factor-type u denote the type of factor nodes,
in which the value of a factor node is regarded as the values
of variable nodes connected to the factor node, i.e., there
exists u(x) factor nodes connecting variable nodes of values
x1 , x2 , . . . , xr . Here, the order of values is distinguished for
general f (x) which is not invariant under permutations of the
arguments x ∈ X r . Let N( , u) be the number of assignments

Here, we consider randomness of the energy function and the
expectation of PE ({ν(z)}) with respect to it, i.e., P({ν(z)}) :=

The above maximization problem can be regarded as the

For obtaining the constant factor, the central approximation
is used similarly as in the previous section. The derivation is
omitted for the lack of space. The unique difference is that the
condition (11) affects the widths of rectangles in the Riemann

rectangles as the unknown variable s, the following theorem

is obtained with the covariance matrix (V −V )(I|X | −C(V −

theorem also holds. The results in this section can be generalized to the quenched version by using the replica method
similarly to the previous section.

where F is given by (12), and where s is some integer
depending on l, r and the support of f (x).
Let S ⊆ X r be the support of f (x). In order to obtain s, the
following condition for {ε(x)} x∈S , which play the same role
in the analysis as those in (9), must be considered:

(Nx (x) − Nx (x0 )) ε(x) is a multiple of l

(13)
where 0 and x0 are any ﬁxed elements in X and S, respectively. Although we have not obtained a general result about s,
there are several cases where s can easily be speciﬁed. When
l is a prime, (13) deﬁnes simultaneous linear equations on
the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fl . Hence, s = l c where c denotes the rank
of the simultaneous linear equations. When X = {0, 1}, one
has s = l/g where g := gcd({N0 (x) − N0 (x0 )} x∈S \x0 , l). As a
consequence, the asymptotic expected number of codewords
of LDPC codes is obtained up to the constant factor [6].
The annealed version of Theorem 4 for random regular
factor graph ensembles is obtained as follows.
