Abstract—This paper considers the multi-way relay channel
(MWRC) where multiple users exchange messages via a single
relay. The capacity region is derived for a special class of MWRCs
where (i) the uplink and the downlink are separated in the
sense that there is no direct user-to-user links, (ii) the channel
is restricted in the sense that each user’s transmitted channel
symbols can depend on only its own message, but not on its
received channel symbols, and (iii) the uplink is any deterministic
function.

X0 , X1 , . . . , XL , Y0 , Y1 , . . . , YL , and two probability distribution functions (pdf): (i) the uplink p∗ (y0 |x1 , x2 , . . . , xL ),
and (ii) the downlink p∗ (y1 , y2 , . . . , yL |x0 ). The channel is
separated in the sense that there is no direct user-to-user link.
In this paper, we consider MWRCs with deterministic uplink
where the pdf for the uplink has the following form:

Remark 1: Condition (5) implies that the uplink is deterministic and its input signals are non-interfering, i.e., the
relay receives all transmitted codewords x([1:L]) without error.
Due to condition (4), for any rate tuple in R , we have
|Wi | = 2nRi ≤ |Xi |n for all i ∈ [1 : L]. This means for
any rate tuple in R , we can choose an uplink code {xi (wi )}

In this section, we prove Theorem 1 using cut-set arguments
for multiterminal networks [12, pp. 589–591]. Let the set S
be a subset of the nodes, S ⊂ [0 : L], and let S c [0 : L] \ S,
where the sets S and S c each contain at least one user, i.e.,
S ∩ [1 : L] = ∅ and S c ∩ [1 : L] = ∅. We canonically deﬁne
R0 = 0.

is a deterministic function of (X(U c ) , X(U ) ), and (9f) is obtained
because conditioning cannot increase entropy. Now, since Wi ’s
are independent, {Xit (Wi ) : i ∈ [1 : L]} are independent for a
ﬁxed t. It follows that {Xi : i ∈ [1 : L]} are independent given
Q. So, (9f) must hold for all selections of non-empty strict

Case 2: 0 ∈ S. For this case, we have S = {0} ∪ U and S c =

meaning that Perror,n Pr{a (more capable) user wrongly

that it has access to Y (S c ) and W(S c ) instead of just Y i

region in Theorem 2. A major difference between the coding
scheme in this paper and the modiﬁed NNC scheme is that,
for the latter, the decoding of the messages in all B blocks is
done simultaneously after the entire B blocks of transmission,
and is therefore more complex and incurs a larger decoding
delay.
A crucial point for the coding scheme derived in this paper
to be optimal is that each user can recover y 0 even when the
codebook size of the relay is upper bounded by 2n i∈[1:L] Ri .
This no longer holds when a small amount of noise is injected
into the uplink, i.e., when y0 is not a deterministic function of
x([1:L]) . Hence this scheme might not be optimal for MWRCs
with noisy uplinks.
Our coding scheme is derived for the restricted MWRC
in which the users are not allowed to use feedback in their
transmission. It has been shown [15] that for a two-user MWRC
with deterministic uplink and downlink, the capacity region of
the unrestricted channel (where the transmitted symbols of the
users can be functions of their previously received symbols) is
strictly larger than the restricted channel. Hence, the coding
scheme derived in this paper might not be optimal for the
unrestricted MWRCs, even with deterministic uplinks.

Now, we repeat the above decoding steps for all users j ∈
[1 : L], and for all blocks b ∈ [1 : B−1]. Denote the probability
that some user makes a decoding error in block (b + 1) by
Pe,b . From the union bound, we have

Suppose that a rate tuple (R1 , R2 , . . . , RL ) satisﬁes (1) and
(2) with strict inequalities for some joint pdf (3). By choosing
a sufﬁciently large B and a sufﬁciently small , we can satisfy
B
j∈[1:L]\{i} B−1 Rj + 4 ≤ I(X0 ; Yi ) each i ∈ [1 : L], and
B
j∈U B−1 Rj + 7 ≤ H(Y0 |X(U c ) , Q) for each non-empty
U ⊂ [1 : L]. By choosing a sufﬁciently large n, Pe < (B −
1)L 2 + 2−n + (2L−1 − 1)2−n can be made as small as
desired. Hence the rate (R1 , R2 , . . . , RL ) is achievable. This
proves Theorem 2.

The achievable rate region in Theorem 2 has the same form as
that of the noisy network coding (NNC) scheme [14]. However,
the NNC scheme allows the transmitted symbols of each user to
depend on its previously received symbols—this is not allowed
in the channel considered in this paper. Nevertheless, one can
incorporate this restriction in the derivation of the NNC scheme

and set Y0 = Y0 , Yi = ∅, ∀i ∈ [1 : L] to obtain the same rate
