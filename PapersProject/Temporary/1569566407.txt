be utilized to manage interference between the users. Motivated by the early results of [9] on packet erasure channels,
we focus on a basic setting with binary inputs and binary
fading of the channels.
As a benchmark, we characterize the capacity region with
full-NSI and output feedback. We show that presence of output
feedback links can noticably enlarge the capacity region.
However, what we are interested in is the capacity region of
the two-user binary IC with delayed-NSI and output feedback.
In our earlier work [13] for the two-user binary fading IC
with delayed-NSI, we have shown how outdated NSI can be
systematically utilized in order to enhance the achievable sumrate. In particular, we proposed a two-phase transmission strategy, where in the ﬁrst phase, both transmitters send uncoded
bits to the receivers simultaneously. Then in the second phase,
the transmitted bits in the ﬁrst phase could be categorized
into different “virtual states” based on the outdated NSI. The
bits for which the transmission has not been completed, could
be elevated into two different sub-problems: the two-source
multicast, and the two-user IC with side-information. One
key observation was that, for any bit that is communicated
successfully in the former sub-problem, two bits are delivered
at the receivers. Therefore, although the latter sub-problem
has a higher sum-rate, the former sub-problem has a higher
“effective” sum-rate.
In this work, we demonstrate how delayed output feedback
can be utilized to further improve the achievable rates. It is
well known that transmitter cooperation can be created by the
means of output feedback. We exploit this opportunity and we
show that all the bits in the second phase, can now be elevated
to the more efﬁcient sub-problem (the two-source multicast)
which in turn results in a higher achievable sum-rate.
We also derive new outer-bounds on the capacity region of
the two-user binary fading IC with delayed-NSI and output
feedback. The key part is to focus on one transmitter and
see how it can privilege one receiver to the other one given
outdated NSI and maximize this privilege.
Related work: There has been several works in the literature
to study the DoF region of Gaussian interference and X
channels with delayed-NSI [3], [14], [15]. However, except
for some particular examples, the achievable schemes are not
optimal and there is a large gap between the achievable rates
and the available converses. This is one of our motivations
to consider the two-user binary fading IC with delayed-NSI
and output feedback, in order to understand how interference

Abstract—In this paper, we study the capacity region of
the two-user binary fading interference channel with delayed
network state information at the transmitters and a noiseless
output feedback link from each receiver to its corresponding
transmitter. Our results include a new achievability strategy that
systematically utilizes the stale network state information and the
previously received signals at the receivers, in order to enhance
the achievable rate region. We also derive new outer-bounds on
the capacity region of such network, and we show that the delay
in learning network state information results in some loss in the
capacity region.

I. I NTRODUCTION
It is widely known that network state information (NSI)
and output feedback can provide signiﬁcant capacity gains in
wireless networks. For example, NSI can be used to design
the transmit signals in order to align [1], [2], [3], or to
neutralize [4] interference. Also, output feedback can be used
in interference channels to create better alternative paths to
the destinations [5], [6], and hence, increasing the capacity.
However, a fundamental consideration for both NSI and output
feedback is that they are subject to delay that is imposed by
the feedback channels from the receivers.
Recently, there has been a noticable growing interest in
studying the effect of lack of up-to-date NSI at the transmitters
in wireless networks. In particular, in [1], authors have considered the MIMO broadcast channel and have shown that even
completely stale network state information is still very useful
and can change the scale of the capacity, measured by the
degrees of freedom (DoF). The main idea behind the algorithm
is that instead of predicting future network state information,
we should focus on the side-information provided in the past
signaling stages via the feedback links. This idea was initially
proposed for packet erasure channels with ARQ feedback [7],
[8], [9], [10], [11]. The idea is that if the transmitter sends data
to one receiver, but is informed through ACK/NACK feedback
that the message is received by the unintended receiver(s), then
this information can be exploited in later stages of signaling
to reduce the time needed for communication.
The result of [1] was extended in [12] to the case of the
MIMO Gaussian interference channel with delayed-NSI and
output feedback. In particular, the DoF region of the MIMO IC
is characterized, and it is shown that having output feedback
can strictly enlarge the DoF region compared to the case where
only delayed-NSI is available at the transmitters.
In this paper, we consider the two-user interference channel
and study how delayed output feedback and delayed-NSI can

management can be carried on with such assumptions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we formulate our problem. In Section III, we present our
main results. In Section IV, we will provide our achievability
scheme. Next in Section V, we describe our outer-bounds.

λi,n = E[P [Wi = Wi ]],

We consider a two-user interference channel (IC) as in
Figure 1(a). The channel gain from transmitter Txi to receiver
Rxj at time instant t is denoted by Cij [t], i, j ∈ {1, 2}. We
assume that the channel gains are either 0 or 1, and they are
distributed as i.i.d. (independent from each other and over
d
time) Bernoulli random variables (i.e., Cij [t] ∼ B(p)) where
i, j ∈ {1, 2}, and 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. Deﬁne q = 1 − p.
At each time instant t, the transmit signal at transmitter
Txi is denoted by Xi [t] ∈ {0, 1}, and the received signal at
receiver Rxi is given by
i ∈ {1, 2},

III. M AIN R ESULTS
We study the capacity region of the two-user binary IC
with delayed-NSI and output feedback in detail. We ﬁrst
derive a new achievable rate region for the two-user binary
IC described in Section II. Our achievability demonstrates
how outdated NSI and previously received signals can be
systematically exploited in order to enhance the achievable
sum-rate. Presence of output feedback links provides the cooperation opportunity among the transmitters. We incorporate
this opportunity in our achievability scheme and the achievable
rate region would be larger than our earlier results in [13]
where no output feedback link is available.
Then, we derive new outer-bounds on the capacity region of
the two-user binary IC with delayed NSI and output feedback
that is strictly smaller than that of the full-NSI and output
feedback. The main idea is to consider one transmitter and
see how it can privilege one receiver to the other one given
outdated NSI and maximize this privilege.
As a benchmark, we consider two extreme cases: (1) noNSI (i.e., transmitters only know the distribution from which
the channel gains are drawn, but not the actual realization
of them) and no output feedback; and (2) full-NSI (i.e., the
network state information C t is available at each transmitter
at time instant t) and output feedback. The following lemma
presents the capacity regions in these cases.
Lemma 1: The capacity region of the two-user binary IC
described in Section II with no-NSI and no output feedback,
C no , and with full-NSI and output feedback, C FNSI,OFB , are

where ¯ = 3 − i, and the summation is in F2 .

Furthermore, the network state information (NSI) at time
instant t is denoted by the quadruple
C[t] = (C11 [t], C12 [t], C21 [t], C22 [t]).

(2)

We use the following notations in this paper. We use capital
letters to denote random variables (RVs), e.g. Cij [t] is a random variable at time instant t. We use small letters to denote
a particular realization of the corresponding random variable,
e.g. cij [t] is a particular realization of random variable Cij [t].
Suppose S ⊆ Z+ is of size |S| > 0 and S = {s1 , s2 , . . . , s|S| }
where s1 < s2 < . . . < s|S| . Then we deﬁne
C S = C[s1 ], C[s2 ], . . . , C[s|S| ] .

and the expectation is taken with respect to the random choice
of the transmitted messages W1 and W2 . A rate tuple (R1 , R2 )
is said to be achievable, if there exists encoding and decoding
functions at the transmitters and the receivers respectively,
such that the decoding error probabilities λ1,n , λ2,n go to zero
as n goes to inﬁnity.

moreover, we set i : j equal to {i, i + 1, . . . , j} for i ≤ j
and equal to ∅ otherwise. also, for simplicity of notation, we
represent C 1:i by C i , i ≥ 1.
In this paper, we assume that receivers have full knowledge
of the NSI, and we assume that at time instant t, each
transmitter has the knowledge of the network state information
up to time instant t (i.e., C t−1 ) and the distribution from which
the future channel gains are drawn, t = 1, . . . , n, and we refer
to this assumption as delayed-NSI.
Consider the scenario in which transmitter Txi wishes
to reliably communicate message Wi ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2nRi }
to receiver Rxi during n uses of the channel, i = 1, 2.
We assume that there is a noiseless feedback link of unite
capacity from each receiver to its corresponding transmitter
and hence transmitter Txi at time instant t has access to Yit−1 ,
i = 1, 2. Moreover, we assume that the messages and the
channel gains are mutually independent and the messages are
chosen uniformly. For each transmitter Txi , let message Wi
n
be encoded as Xi using an encoding function that depends
on the available NSI at transmitter Txi and Yit−1 . Receiver
Rxi is only interested in decoding Wi , and it will decode
the message using the decoding function Wi = gi (Yin , C n ).

The capacity region of the two-source multicast network
is equal to the capacity region of the multiple access channel (MAC) formed by the two transmitters and one of the
receivers. Hence, deriving the converse is straightforward and
omitted. Here, we brieﬂy describe the achievability scheme.
In [16], it has been shown that for a point-to-point erasure
channel with capacity C, using random block coding of length
n, a rate R is achievable where C − 3δ < R ≤ C − 2δ, and
the decoding error probability is less than or equal to 2 for
ﬁxed , δ > 0.
In our problem, each channel behaves as an erasure channel
with capacity p. We can model the channel from transmitter
Tx2 to receiver Rx1 as an erasure channel with erasure
probability equal to pq (C11 [t] = 1 or C21 [t] = 0 is considered
as erasure). Therefore, we know that a rate arbitrary close pq is
n
achievable. Receiver Rx1 decodes W2 and removes X2 from
its received signal. Now the channel from Tx1 to Rx1 becomes
an erausre channel with erasure probability p. Therefore, we
have a sum-rate arbitrary close to p + pq = 1 − q 2 .

Figures 1(b), (c), and (d) depict our results for p = 0.25, 0.5,
and 0.75. Figure 1(c) summerizes our results in [13] as well.
Remark 1: As it can be seen in Figure 1, the capacity region
with delayed-NSI and output feedback is strictly smaller than
the case of full-NSI and output feedback. Hence, the delay in
learning the NSI results in a capacity region loss.
IV. ACHIEVABILITY S TRATEGY FOR T HEOREM 1
In this section, we present the transmission strategy
for the binary IC with delayed-NSI and output feedback.

B. Transmission Strategy
We now formally describe the achievability strategy for the
corner point in (11). We consider 3 distinct states of a bit
at transmitter Txi : (1) Qi→i denotes the initial state of the
bits; (2) Qi→{1,2} denotes the bits that are of interest of both
receivers; and (3) Qi→F denotes the successfully transmitted
bits that do not fall in Qi→{1,2} , i = 1, 2.
Deﬁne m = nR1 = nR2 , and let W1 = a1 , . . . , am ,
and W2 = b1 , . . . , bm , where ai ’s and bi ’s are picked uniformly and independently from {0, 1}, i = 1, . . . , m.
Phase 1 (raw bit transmission): At the beginning of the
communication block, we assume that the bits at transmitter
Txi are in state Qi→i . At each time instant, transmitter Txi
sends a bit from Qi→i . Then, based on the channel gain realizations, a total of 16 possible conﬁgurations may occur at any
time instant, see Table I. In cases 5, 6, 13, 16 (9, 10, 14, 16),
no change happens in the status of a transmitted bit from
transmitter Tx2 (Tx1 ) and therefore, such bit remains in state
Q2→2 (Q1→1 ). In cases 4, 9, 10 (4, 5, 6), the transmitted bit
from transmitter Tx2 (Tx1 ) is communicated successfully
and joins Q2→F (Q1→F ). The description for other cases is

(11)

where α is given in (9). The ﬁrst two corner points are
achievable with no-NSI. We describe a transmission strategy
that achieves arbitrary close to the latter corner point. Thus,
with time sharing, we get the desired result. We will use the
following result in our transmission strategy.
A. Two-Source Multicast Network
Consider a network with two transmitters and two receivers
where each transmitter Txi wishes to communicate an independent message Wi to both receivers, i = 1, 2. The channel
gain model is the same as described in Section II. We refer to
this network as the two-source multicast networ.
Lemma 2: For the two-source multicast network as described above, we have

In the aforementioned cases, providing a bit (which can
be a combination of two bits) to both receivers is sufﬁcient.
Although in some cases, both transmitters have the possibility
to send this bit, just one of them needs to do so. We would like
to have almost equal number of bits in Q1→{1,2} and Q2→{1,2}
(the reason will be clear in Phase 2). To do so, if a pairing
opportunity is available at time t where t is odd (even), then
the required combination of bits joins Q1→{1,2} (Q2→{1,2} ).
After the initial states become empty, the transmission of the
bits in Qi→{1,2} , i = 1, 2, continue in phase 2.
Phase 2 (multicast transmission): Note that the bits in
Qi→{1,2} are of interest of both receivers. In this phase, the
bits in Qi→{1,2} are considered as the message of transmitter
Txi in the problem of two-source multicast, and they will be
encoded as in the achievability scheme of Lemma 2.
In the remaining of this section, we provide the analysis
of the achievable sum-rate using our two-phase transmission
strategy and its decoding error probability. In particular, we
show that with probability approching 1 as m → ∞, the
required time to transmit all 2m initial bits is at most

At the end of phase 1, we add 0’s (if necessary) in order
to make all states of size equal to the corresponding expected

value plus m 3 . Therefore, as m → ∞, the number of bits in
each state goes to inﬁnity. We are now ready to caluculate the
required time to transmit the remaining bits in phase 2.

Required time to ﬁnish phase 1: The number of remaining
bits in Qi→i during phase 1 is a Markov chain that at each

unchanged, i = 1, 2. The total initial number of bits is equal to
2m. Let random variable T1 denote the number of time instants
in which phase 1 will be over (when both initial queues
become empty). Using union bound and Chernoff bound, we
can show that

provided below. Transmitters keep sending bits from the initial
states until they become empty (if one of the initial states
becomes empty ﬁrst, the corresponding transmitter will simply
remain silent until the end of phase 1).
• Case 1: Each receiver gets a linear combination of the
transmitted bits, see Table I. Now, if either of such bits is
provided to both receivers, then they can decode both bits.
• Cases 2 and 3: Consider the transmitted bits in cases 2 and
3 as in Figure 2. We can combine the two states and solve
them simultaneously by providing ai ⊕ bj to both receivers.
The combination of two bits can be created by either one of
the transmitters. Note that using output feedback links, Tx1
(Tx2 ) has access to bit bj (ai ).
• Case 7: Receiver Rx1 gets a linear combination of the
transmitted bits. Now, if the bit of transmitter Tx2 is provided
to both receivers, then each receivers can decode its bit. Cases
8,11, and 12 are similar.
• Case 15: In this case, receiver Rxi has received the transmitted bit of transmitter Tx¯, i = 1, 2. Using feedback links, each
i
transmitter will have access to the other transmitter’s bit as
well. Now if the combination of the two bits is provided to the
receivers, they can decode the intended bits. This combination
can be provided by either of the two transmitters. Cases 13
and 14 can be treated together as case 15.

Suppose there exist encoders and decoders as described in
Section II such that rate tuple (R1 , R2 ) is achievable with
arbitrary small decoding error probability as n → ∞. The
outer-bound on Ri is essentially the capacity result for an
erasure channel with success probability p, and the one on
R1 + R2 follows from the full-NSI case. The outer-bound on
2R1 + R2 can be obtained as follows.
