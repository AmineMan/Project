where IA = 1 if A is true and zero otherwise. The problem of
counting subsequences in a text is known as the hidden pattern
matching problem and was studied in [1], [7]. In this paper,
to derive our results we ﬁrst represent the mutual information
between the input and output of a deletion channel in terms
of the count ΩX (w) for a random sequence X.

Abstract—We study the binary deletion channel where each
input bit is independently deleted according to a ﬁxed probability.
We relate the conditional probability distribution of the output
of the deletion channel given the input to the hidden pattern
matching problem. This yields a new characterization of the
mutual information between the input and output of the deletion
channel. Through this characterization we are able to comment
on the the deletion channel capacity, in particular for deletion
probabilities approaching 0 and 1.

In this paper, we focus on memoryless distributions on X1 ,
however, it appears that most of our results extend to larger
classes (Markovian). Suppose that X1 X2 . . . is an i.i.d. sequence of Bernoulli random variables with parameter p. For

where PX1 is the distribution of X1 , and I(X1 ; Y (X1 ))
is the mutual information between the input and output of
the deletion channel. Many bounds have been derived for the
capacity (see the survey article by Mitzenmacher [11]).
Let x = xn ∈ {0, 1}n and w = w1 w2 . . . wm ∈ {0, 1}m ,
1
m ≤ n, be binary sequences. Let Ωx (w) denote the number
of occurrences of w as a subsequence (i.e., not consecutive
symbols) of x, that is,

I[xi1 =w1 ] I[xi2 =w2 ]

A deletion channel with parameter d takes a binary sequence x := xn = x1 · · · xn where xi ∈ A = {0, 1} as
1
input and deletes each symbol in the sequence independently
with probability d. The output of such a channel is then
a subsequence Y = Y (x) = xi1 ...xiM of x, where M
follows the binomial distribution Bi(n, (1 − d)), and the
indices i1 , ..., iM correspond to the bits that are not deleted.
Despite signiﬁcant effort [2], [3], [5], [9], [10], [11], [12], [14]
the mutual information between the input and output of the
deletion channel and its capacity are still unknown. Our goal
is to provide a more detailed characterization of the mutual
information for memoryless sources (extensions to strongly
mixing sources or Markovian sources seem likely). Through
this characterization we are able to comment on the channel
capacity for two special cases: d → 1 and d → 0. The latter
case was already discussed in [10], [9]. We derive our results
by relating the the conditional probability distribution of the
output of the deletion channel given the input to the so called
hidden pattern matching analyzed recently in [1], [7].
Following [4], the channel capacity of the deletion channel
with deletion probability d is

I(d, p) = λ(d, p) + (1 − d)H(p) − H(1 − d)
where, H(·) is the binary entropy function. Further1

From Theorem 2, I(d, p) ≤ I(X1 ; Y (X1 )) = H(p)(1 − d).
When optimized over p, this upper bound matches the capacity
asymptotically for d → 0 but not for d → 1, as our next result
(Theorem 3) shows. This also implies that λ(d, p) ≤ H(1−d).
Note that for d → 1 it is just known that C(d) = Θ(1−d) [2],

· · · I[xim =wm ] , (1)

[11], [12]. Our next result is a bound on I(d, p) that implies
that, in contrast to the case d → 0, i.i.d. distributions over the
n
inputs X1 do not asymptotically achieve capacity as d → 1.

with |w|=m P n (w) = 1. In particular, if X is memoryless,
then P n (w) = P (w) where P (w) is the probability that
X1 X2 ...X|w| = w (see [1] for dynamic X).

Theorem 3. For all p ≥ 0, as d → 1

Proof: Taking expectation on both sides of (1) we have

where the constant K > 0 is absolute.

proving the lemma.

Finally we demonstrate the strength of our method by reproving Kanoria and Montanari’s [10] expansion for I(d, p)
for d → 0 leading to C(d) = I(d, 1/2) + O(d3/2−ε ) =
1 + d log d − Ad + O(d3/2−ε ) (cf. Theorem 4), where A =

In this section, we ﬁrst prove Theorem 1 and then present
a simple proof of the fact that C(d) ≤ 1 − d.

the deletion channel through the following observation. For all

We now restrict the channel input distributions to be memoryless over A with p denoting the probability of “0”. We
prove Theorems 2 and 3 in this section.

+ E[ΩX (w)] log dn−|w| (1 − d)|w| ).

The theorem follows from (6) and (7).

A. Proof of Theorem 2
The next lemma follows from the deﬁnition ΩX (w).

B. Upper Bound for the Capacity

Lemma 3. For all binary sequences w, and all xn+k ∈ An+k

It is well known that the capacity C(d) of a deletion channel
with deletion probability d can be bounded from above by the
capacity of an erasure channel with the erasure probability d
(e.g., see [3]). We provide a direct proof of this fact. To do
so, we ﬁrst compute the expectation of ΩX (w).

Ωxn+k (w) =

n+1

(9)

w1 w2 =w

where the sum is taken over all pairs w1 , w2 such that their
concatenation w1 w2 equals w.
We also require the following lemma.

P n (w),
|w|

Lemma 4. Let zm and am , 1 ≤ m ≤ M , be non-negative
numbers. Then we have

Substituting this in (8) completes the proof, and also establishes an upper bound of C(d) ≤ 1 − d for the capacity.

E ΩX1 (w) =

Next, we compute the conditional entropy H(Y |X). Notice
that for x ∈ An and y ∈ Am we have P (x, y) =
P (x)Ωx (y)dn−m (1 − d)m . Combining this with (5) we obtain
H(Y |X) = −

n
m

Since for all m ≥ 0, P n (w) is a probability distribution over
w ∈ Am , we have |w|=m P n (w) log(1/P n (w)) ≤ log 2m =
m, and consequently

and this in combination with Lemma 1 gives us

We use X and Y to abbreviate
and Y
respectively.
Using (5), we will compute H(Y ) and H(Y |X) and use
I(X; Y ) = H(Y ) − H(Y |X) to prove the theorem. We
ﬁrst compute H(Y ). Observe that, from (5) P (Y = w) =

Lemma 6. If X1 is a memoryless binary sequence with
parameter p, then S2 ∼ n · (H(1 − d) − (1 − d)H(p)) as
n → ∞.

Proof: Apply the inequality log x ≤ x − 1.
Lemma 5. Let X1 X2 . . . be a memoryless random binary
sequence. Then

This completes the proof of the lemma.
The next step is to show a similar property for S1 , namely
that S1 ∼ n · λ(d, p), where λ(d, p) is a non-negative constant.
The problem is to obtain some information about λ(d, p), but
for this we would need precise information about the behavior
of ΩX (w).

(and a similar relation for the sum over w2 ) we immediately
derive cn+k ≤ cn + ck . Note that we have used the property

that X1 and Xn+1 are independent and that Xn+1 has the

By Fekete’s lemma [13] the following corollary follows.

In particular, I(d, p) ≤ n I(X1 ; Y (X1 )) for all n ≥ 1. If
we apply this for n = 1, 2 we ﬁnd

Proof: We have

I(d, p) ≤ (1 − d)H(p), and

ΩX n+k (w) log ΩX n+k (w) =

where q = 1−p. For example, by looking at the second bound
we observe that sup0≤p≤1 I(d, p) ≤ 1−d + (1 − d)2 which
2
implies that memoryless input distributions do not meet the
general upper bound 1−d when d → 1. Actually we will show
that sup0≤p≤1 I(d, p) is much smaller as d → 1 (Theorem 3).
We now prove Theorem 2. As above, we write

Let T2 denote the subsum of (2) corresponding to those

By another application of Fekete’s lemma [13] the sequence

have used the property an+k ≥ an + ak here.
The proof of Theorem 2 is a combination of Lemma 6 and
Lemma 8. The lower bound on λ(d, p) follows from the fact
that I(d, p) ≥ 0.

C. Lower Bound for d → 0

For such distributions, Lemma 7 generalizes to an+k ≥ an +
ak + K1 for some constant K1 , hence Lemma 8 holds as well.

Finally, we comment on the case d → 0 that has been
already solved in [10] and [9] where it is shown that
I(d, 0.5) = 1 + d log d − Ad + O(d2−ε ) as d → 0 and
C(d) = I(d, 0.5)+O(d3/2−ε ). The approach presented in [10]
is quite different from ours. However, we can use our methods
to obtain corresponding bounds. In particular, we easily obtain
the following lower bound for I(d, p).

B. Proof of Theorem 3: d → 1
We consider the expression in (2). We ﬁrst note that the
empty word does not contribute to the sum (2). Next we
n
consider words of length 1. If w = 0 and if X = X1 consists
of m zeroes and n − m ones then ΩX (w) = m. The situation

Now we choose n = d−ε which ensures that (1−d)n−1 =
1 + O(d1−ε ). From the deﬁnition of λ(d, p) and (3), this
implies that

Theorem 4. As d → 0,
I(d, p) ≥(1 − d)H(p) + d log d − d log(e)
+ d(q 2 f (p) + p2 f (p)) + O d2−ε

(12)

λ(d, p) ≥ d(q 2 f (p) + p2 f (q)) + O(d2−ε ).

for every ε > 0, where f (x) denotes the function f (x) =
log and q = 1 − p. Furthermore, as d → 0,
≥2 x
I(d, p) ≤ H(p) + d log d + O(d log log(1/d)).

Since H(1 − d) = −d log d − (1 − d) log(1 − d) = −d log d +
d log(e) + O(d2 ) we obtain the lower bound (12).
For the upper bound we proceed as in the proof of Theorem 3. We start with S1 . Let S1,n−1 denote the subsum of S1
corresponding to words of length n − 1. Then it follows from
the above calculations that S1,n−1 = O(nd) (actually we can
be much more precise). Furthermore, it follows as in the proof
of Theorem 3 that S1 − S1,n−1 = O log n d2 n2 if dn → 0.
Finally, for S2 we have (see Lemma 6)

(13)

Proof: The lower bound for I(d, p) follows from ideas
similar to those in the proof of Theorem 2. Instead of taking
the limit of an /n deﬁned in Lemma 7 we derive lower bounds
for an /n for certain n. We will only consider words w with
|w| = n − 1. Then
an ≥ d(1 − d)n−1

E[ΩX (w) log ΩX (w)].

S2 = −n(1 − d)H(p) + d(1 − d)n−1 n log n + O log n d2 n2 .

|w|=n−1

Consequently, we obtain for n = n(d) = d−1 / log d−1

Suppose for the moment that w has the form w =
0i1 1j1 0i2 1j2 · · · 0iK 1jK , where ir , jr ≥ 1; this means that
w1 = 0 and wn−1 = 1 (the other cases can be handled in
completely the same way). If |w| = n − 1, then we have
ΩX (w) = (for some > 2) if and only if there exists r with

where ir (w) denotes the length of the r-th 0-run in w and
jr (w) the length of the r-th 1-run in w. Now let Z be a
new random variable deﬁned on words w of length n − 1 as
Z = Z(w) = r≥1 (pI[ir (w)= −1] + qI[jr (w)= −1] ). Then we
