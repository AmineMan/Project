which is universally utilized in current and emerging cellular
systems. The key idea is that the overhead from estimating the
channel states grows with the size of the cooperation clusters,
prompting the use of ﬁnite-size clusters that are subject to outof-cluster interference. While our results assume pilot-based
coherent communication, a companion paper deals with the
more general case of noncoherent communication showing
that, even in that case, saturation of the spectral efﬁciency
is unavoidable [9].
The fact that the interference power should scale with the
transmit power is acknowledged in [10], [11]. However, in
[10] and [11] the channel gains are deterministic and thereby
known perfectly—at no cost—by all the transmitters and
receivers in the system. In our analysis, the channel gains
outside the cluster of interest cannot be known and those
within the cluster have to be learned. Additionally, [10] and
[11] assume a speciﬁc relationship between the signal-to-noise
ratio and the signal-to-interference ratio, while our approach
is general in that respect.
Pilot-based explicit channel estimation is the de-facto approach in modern cellular systems. A cellular system featuring full cooperation with pilot-based channel estimation was
studied in [4], but a single isolated cluster was considered.
Results for different cluster sizes were provided in [6], but
the channel estimation overheads were neglected. Analysis
including pilot-based channel estimation and the resulting
overhead in [7] shows that, in some cases, a cooperative
system indeed performs worse than an uncooperative one.
While the analysis in [7] is comprehensive in several ways,
a generic model capturing the key impacts is not proposed.
Work in [5] and [8] considers the impact of estimation error
and overhead on the performance of interference alignment
(IA) in the interference channel. The authors argue that, due
to estimation errors, IA should be performed in ﬁnite clusters
using orthogonal signaling resources, neglecting out-of-cluster
interference.

Abstract—Cooperation in a large wireless network with pilotassisted coherent communication is shown to have certain fundamental limitations, namely that even perfect cooperation cannot
in general change an interference-limited network to a noiselimited one. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate the existence of a
spectral efﬁciency upper bound that does not grow with the
transmit power, when channels are estimated via pilot signals.
This is because pilot-assisted channel estimation is only possible
within ﬁnite cooperation clusters, resulting in out-of-cluster interference that scales with the transmit power. Making the clusters
excessively large can actually worsen this effect, nor does sidestepping the pilot-assisted channel estimation via noncoherent
demodulation provide an escape. Using a cellular system as an
example, it is demonstrated that the spectral efﬁciency saturates
at power levels of operational relevance, indicating that the
lackluster gains from cooperation observed in practice may be
based on fundamental information-theoretic limitations, rather
than current technology imperfections.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The standard information-theoretic model for communication in cellular systems is the interference channel. This is
justiﬁed under the assumption that each base station (BS)
transmits and receives autonomously. Based on research conducted over the last decade [1], it is now widely believed that
in future networks the performance limitations of the interference channel could be overcome through cooperation. If the
BSs were to cooperate, the logic goes, the interference channel
could be converted to a massive broadcast channel (BC, for the
downlink) or multiple access channel (MAC, for the uplink),
with all the BSs jointly decoding (MAC) or encoding (BC). At
present, cooperation is somewhat constrained by the backhaul
capabilities in current cellular infrastructure [2]. With ideas
like cloud radio access networks, however, it seems forseeable
that an arbitrary number of BSs would be able to cooperate in
the future to achieve enormous spectral efﬁciency gains over
the lone-BS model [3]. Based on this logic, it appears that the
study of the interference channel for cellular systems is just
an artifact of current technological limitations.
In this paper, we establish a new model for communication in cellular networks. Our main insight is to show that
the existence of interference whose power scales with the
transmit power is inevitable in large systems, regardless of
the extent of the cooperation. In particular, we show how this
limitation arises with pilot-based channel estimation [4]–[8],

The traditional approach to analyzing performance in a
cellular system is to study a simpler setting representing a
fragment of the system. Such simpler settings are typically
described (at a given time epoch) by the following relationship.

Relationship 1 (Traditional System Model)
The observation at receiver n is

ﬁeld trials, however, these gains do not seem to materialize
and the reported gains are meager, on the order of 10-20%
[1], [16]–[18]. The major discrepancy between theoretical
predictions and observed performance raises questions as to
whether Relationship 1 is the correct model for a fragment of
a cellular system.

where K and N are the number of transmitters and receivers,
respectively, Xk is the signal generated by transmitter k,
normalized such that P is its power, and Hnk is the channel
from transmitter k to receiver n. The term Zn is the noise at
receiver n, typically white and Gaussian, with some normalized variance.

III. P ROPOSED M ODEL
A problem with Relationship 1 is that there are K possibly cooperating transmitters and all other interference is
ignored. The K cooperating transmitters are typically geographic neighbors, and are referred to as a cluster. It is usually
assumed that any interference from outside the cluster can be
lumped into the Zn noise terms. It cannot, because Zn has a
ﬁxed variance that does not depend on P whereas the out-ofcluster interference power is proportional to P . This can be
resolved by modifying Relationship 1 as follows.

While the model can be quite elaborate, for the sake of
exposition we henceforth consider single-antenna transmitters
and receivers such that the values in (1) are scalars.
Relationship 1 is quite general and can be used to describe
any network with K transmitters and N receivers, including
the single-user channel, MAC, BC, and K-user interference
channel. It has led to heralded results on the capacity of the BC
and MAC [12], the deﬁnition of the number of DoF (degrees
of freedom) in a network, the idea of IA [13], [14], and the
concept of Network MIMO [3].
Most work related to Relationship 1 has focused on the
high-power regime, where interference becomes important.
For any setting conforming to Relationship 1, the highpower behavior is as illustrated in Fig. 1. If the channel
coefﬁcients {Hnk } are known by the corresponding receivers
and possibly also the transmitters, the spectral efﬁciency
achieved by a given user grows, for P → ∞, linearly with
log(P ) with a slope given by the so-called multiplexing gain.
The multiplexing gain cannot exceed the number of DoF.
Cooperative techniques then aim at maximizing the number
of DoF available in the network, promising large gains in
spectral efﬁciency through cooperation (see, e.g., [15] and
references therein). In subsequent system-level simulations and

In Relationship 2, as P → ∞, the out-of-cluster interference
does as well if the total network size is greater than K. This
gives rise to two distinct regimes for large P : (i) a DoF regime
where the spectral efﬁciency scales with log P , corresponding

2

to when the noise Z is small relative to P but still much larger
than the out-of-cluster interference Z , and (ii) a saturation
regime where the out-of-cluster interference dominates and the
spectral efﬁciency no longer increases signiﬁcantly with P .
The notion of DoF, and with it any standard high-power result,
is only meaningful in the DoF regime, over a bounded range
of P .
As illustrated in Fig. 2, new quantities of interest emerge:
the values of P at which the two transitions occur, i.e., Pdof
and Psat , and the limiting spectral efﬁciency, C∞ . The values
of these new quantities depend on the system topology, the
channel propagation laws, and the degree of user mobility. In
cases of practical interest, we will show that the transition
to the saturation regime takes place within the range of
operational interest and that the result is not an artifact of
having K too small.
Let Gnk denote the average channel power gain resulting
from distance decay, shadow fading, building penetration
losses, antenna patterns, and possibly other factors, between
transmitter k and receiver n. Let us further deﬁne the normalK
ized channel power gains gnk = Gnk / k=1 Gnk such that,
K
for every n, k=1 gnk = 1. Thus, gnk signiﬁes the share of
receiver n’s signal power that corresponds to transmitter k.
The set {gnk }, for which we coin the term geometry proﬁle,
provides a compact but very general representation of all the
channels and channel-dependent effects in the network. Using
the geometry proﬁle, we deﬁne for every receiver n a signalto-noise ratio (SNRn ) that scales with P and a signal-to-(outof-cluster)-interference ratio (SIRn ) that does not scale with
P:
SNRn

SIRn

K

˜
K
k=K+1

For small P , then, SINRn ≈ SNRn whereas, for P → ∞,
→ SIRn . The formulation on the basis of SNRn and SIRn
is very general in that it captures not only the scaling with
P , but also with other parameters such as cell size or noise
variance.
The small-scale fading is modeled as Rayleigh and thus
the normalized fading coefﬁcients satisfy hnk ∼ NC (0, 1).
We consider a frequency-selective channel with coherence
bandwidth Bc and thus the value of each hnk varies from
subband to subband. In terms of the temporal fading dynamics,
both block- and continuous-fading are considered:
• With block fading, the channels remain constant for L
symbols and then change to a different value in an
IID (independent identically distributed) fashion. If we
denote by Tc the channel coherence in time, then—
irrespective of how the signaling is arranged along the
time and frequency dimensions—the number of symbols
over which the channel remains coherent is L = Bc Tc .
• With continuous fading, the channels within each subband are discrete-time stationary and ergodic random processes with a Doppler spectrum Sh (·) that is bandlimited,
i.e., such that

Explicit channel estimation entails the transmission of pilot
symbols regularly in time (and in frequency when multiples
of Bc are spanned) followed by coherent detection of payload
data [19]. Note that (i) pilot symbols are overhead, and (ii) the
periodicity of pilot transmission is determined by the channel
coherence.
Denote by α the share of the symbols reserved for pilots; the
rest, (1−α), is for payload data. The pilot transmissions should
be orthogonally multiplexed from each of the transmitters [20]
and thus the estimation of each of the K channel coefﬁcients
at each receiver relies on a share α/K of the symbols. When
only the kth transmitter is actively sending pilots, the SINR
at receiver n is gnk SINRn and, with block fading, the MMSE
on the estimation of hnk is then [19]

cellular channels, fD = v/(λB), where v is the velocity

The fading is either block (L = 20, 000) or continuous with
a rectangular Doppler spectrum (fD = 2.5 × 10−5 ), which are
equivalent in terms of channel estimation and correspond to
pedestrian velocities.
Fig. 3 illustrates C(SNR) for several cluster sizes. The
baseline K = N = 1 corresponds to single-user decoding,
i.e., no cooperation. The case K = N = 3 corresponds to a
cluster of 3 facing sectors. The case K = N = 21 corresponds
to a cluster of 7 cells: one central cell plus the tier around it.
The pilot overhead α is equal for all users but otherwise it
is optimized to maximize C, i.e., it is optimized for every K
and SNR. The performance improves going from K = 1 to
K = 3 but then degrades when K increases from 3 to 21 and
hence the optimum size is seen to be somewhere in-between.
To gauge the impact of the out-of-cluster interference at
the best cluster size, we re-plot the spectral efﬁciency for
K = N = 3 in Fig. 3 next to that obtained in the same
exact conditions only with all the transmitters outside the
cluster turned off. This comparison, presented in Fig. 4, shows
that without out-of-cluster interference the traditional behavior
is recovered. With it, however, the behavior is drastically
different. Note that modeling the out-of-cluster interference
as additional background noise of ﬁxed variance cannot ﬁx
Relationship 1, as it merely would shift the spectral efﬁciency
by some ﬁxed amount. Only Relationships 2–3 can reproduce
the correct behavior.
The SIR that should be plugged into Relationship 3 can

be found to be SIRn = k=1 Gnk / k=4 Gnk = 9.2 dB
for n = 1, 2, 3 which, indeed, corresponds with the inﬂection
point observed in Fig. 3. That point, which corresponds to Psat
and thus is denoted by SNRsat , delineates the transition between
the DoF and the saturation regimes. The limiting spectral
efﬁciency can be found to be C∞ = 2.54 bits/s/Hz/user.
For user locations different from the ones chosen in this
simulation, and/or with shadow fading accounted for, the SIR
varies and thus the transition between the DoF and the saturation regimes takes place at a different SNRsat , but qualitatively
speaking the behavior is unaltered. Exactly summing the out-

K=N=1

(14)

To provide some concrete numbers for C∞ and Psat , we
consider a cellular system with an inﬁnite number of trisector hexagonal cells of size R. Each sector’s antenna has a
uniform gain over the 120◦ span of the sector and a gain that is
uniformly 20 dB lower outside that span. Orthogonal signaling
resources (time slots and frequency bands) are allocated to
the users within each sector. On any given resource there is a
single user per sector and hence K = N . The user is centered
in azimuth within its sector and at a distance 2R/3 from the
BS. The signals experience distance-dependent decay with an
exponent γ = 3.8 in addition to Rayleigh fading.
Consider the uplink with clusters of arbitrary size K =
N where the BSs fully cooperate via Network MIMO, i.e.,
they jointly decode the K signals received at the N sectors.

where the function f (·) depends on the type of cooperation
among the K = N users. The spectral efﬁciency, which
vanishes for both α → 0 and α → 1, is maximized by a
proper choice of 0 < α < 1.
As K grows, α needs to grow with it to maintain the
effective SINRs. Ultimately, C is bound to peak at some
cluster size and diminish thereafter. Effectively, excessively
large clusters incur excessive overhead and/or poor channel
estimates that ultimately nullify the beneﬁts of cooperation.

interference turned off.
of-cluster interference becomes challenging in general, but the
computation is otherwise conceptually identical.
Similar observations can be made for the downlink, by
extending the pilot-based scheme in [23] to the multicell realm.
VI. C ONCLUSIONS
This paper has shown that saturation of the spectral efﬁciency at sufﬁciently high SNR is unavoidable in large systems
that employ pilot-based channel estimation. Consequently the
spectral efﬁciency behaves as illustrated in Fig. 2 rather than
Fig. 1. This does not nullify the beneﬁts of cooperation, but
it indicates that cooperation has some fundamental limitations
that cannot be overcome just through faster backhaul, more sophisticated signal processing, or other technological advances.
Nevertheless, in many contexts, the value of Psat should be
large enough to allow signiﬁcant gains to be observed in the
DoF regime. That is, cooperation can help approach C∞ faster
and, more importantly, it can increase the value of C∞ . But
the ultimate capacity is in fact bounded as a function of P .
It could be argued that the need for clusters is not fundamental but rather a by-product of the explicit channel estimation
process. If explicit channel estimation could be transcended
by means of noncoherent detection, then perhaps the entire
system could cooperate. In our companion work in [9] we
refute this idea showing that, for K, N > L, saturation of the
spectral efﬁciency is fundamentally unavoidable.
