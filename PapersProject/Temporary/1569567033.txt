The Log-Volume of Optimal Constant-Composition
Codes for Memoryless Channels, Within O(1) Bits

error probabilities are obtained using strong large-deviations
analysis, which are closely related to Laplace’s method for
asymptotic expansion of integrals [6], [7], [8]. A strong largedeviations analysis provides an asymptotic expansion for the
n
probability of rare events such as
i=1 Ui ≥ na where
{Ui , 1 ≤ i ≤ n} are independent and identically distributed
(iid) random variables, and a is strictly larger than the mean of
U1 [6], [7]. In contrast, the classical (“weak”) large-deviations
analysis merely states that the aforementioned probability
vanishes as exp{−nΛ(a)+o(n)} where Λ(·) denotes the largedeviations function for U1 .
This paper builds on [5] to analyze the performance of
constant-composition codes, which are well suited to coding
problems involving input constraints, in which case iid random
codes generally fail to achieve the second-order rate. In the
absence of input constraints, we also show that the log-volume
achieved by random constant-composition codes differs from
that achieved by iid random codes by a constant ∆cc that is
explicitly identiﬁed.
To carry this analysis, we have derived a new result on
conditional strong large-deviations analysis. This shows that
1
the O(log n) term in (1) is 2 log n under regularity assumptions. The analysis also yields the next term in the expansion,
which is a constant when the underlying loglikelihood random
variables are of the nonlattice type, and a bounded oscillating
function of n otherwise. The quest for that term requires a
precise characterization of the asymptotics of channel ﬂuctuations. To this end we use two-term Edgeworth expansions [9],
[10] which can be traced back to Cram´ r [11] and Esseen [12].
e
The Berry-Esseen theorem [10] was used in [1], [2] provides
a bound for deviation from Gaussianity, but that bound is not
sharp enough for our purposes.
All the analysis and results in this paper are based on
asymptotics and the average error probability criterion. Only
two inequalities are used. The ﬁrst is the classical unionof-events bound (also see the RCU bound of [2, p. 2312]),
which is used for analysis of our random-coding scheme and
turns out to be remarkably tight. The second inequality is one
introduced in [2] for proving converse theorems: it provides an
upper bound for M ∗ (n, ) in terms of a maxmin optimization
problem involving the power of a Neyman-Pearson test at
signiﬁcance level 1 − . This is a remarkably powerful idea
which can also be traced back to Strassen [1, pp. 711, 712].
In order to keep the presentation focused, we assume broad
regularity conditions on the channels of interest and exclude

ity : M cc (n, ) = exp{nC − nV Φ−1 (1 − ) + 2 log n + An, +
o(1)} where Φ is the cdf of the standard normal distribution,
and An, is a bounded sequence that can be explicitly identiﬁed
and reduces to a constant in the nonlattice case. A lower
bound is presented, differing from the upper bound by an easily
computable multiplying constant. These expressions hold under
certain regularity assumptions on the channel.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Shannon’s seminal paper introduced the fundamental capacity limits for memoryless communication channels. For
any channel code of length n and tolerable decoding error
probability , the maximum volume of the code is given by
M ∗ (n, ) = enC+o(n) . The o(n) is signiﬁcant for practical
values of n, hence much effort went into characterizing it
in the early 1960’s. In particular, Strassen [1] discovered
that, under regularity assumptions, the o(n) term is of the
√
form − nV Φ−1 (1 − ) + O(log n) where Φ is the Gaussian
cumulative distribution function (cdf) and V is the channel
dispersion, or second-order coding rate. This line of research
seemed forgotten until new ideas revived it, almost half a
century later [2], [3], [4]. The sharpest general result to date
is
√
M ∗ (n, ) = exp{nC − nV Φ−1 (1 − ) + O(log n)} (1)
subject to some regularity conditions on the channel law.
The appeal of asymptotic expansions such as (1) is that (i)
they convey signiﬁcant insights into the essence of the problem
and (ii) they are practically useful as the remainder O(·) term
can be bounded and often neglected for moderate values of n,
as demonstrated in [2].
Still there remains much mystery regarding the third term
in (1), which has been characterized only for the binary
1
symmetric channel (BSC) where it is 2 log n [2, p. 2332].
For the additive white Gaussian channel, the third term is
sandwiched between O(1) and 3 log n + O(1). For the binary
2
erasure channel (BEC), the third term is O(1). For discrete
memoryless channels with ﬁnite input alphabet X , under
regularity assumptions on the channel law, the third term can
be upper-bounded by 1 (|X | − 1) log n. The third term is often
2
signiﬁcant for moderate values of n. Additional analysis is
given in [3, Sec. 3.4.5].
Our recent paper [5] presents a more reﬁned analysis of
the problem, in which asymptotic equalities for the relevant

For some DMCs with capacity-achieving distribution, the
random variable l(X, Y ) is of the lattice type. For instance
l(X; Y ) ∈ {log(2λ), log(2 − 2λ)} for the BSC with crossover
1
probability λ = {0, 2 , 1} and uniform input distribution;
λ
the span of the lattice is log | 1−λ |. However for almost
every asymmetric binary channel, as well as for almost every
nonbinary channel (symmetric or not), l(X; Y ) is not of the
lattice type. We refer to capacity problems where l(X, Y ) is
of the lattice type as the lattice case. The lattice case is not
considered in this paper.
Let Wx {W (·|x)} ∈ P(Y) for each x ∈ X . We deﬁne
the following moments of the random variable l(X, Y ) with
respect to the joint distribution P ×W : the unconditional mean
(= mutual information)

among others channels with zero dispersion and channels for
which the capacity-achieving distribution is not unique. Due to
space limitations, only sketches of the proofs are given here;
complete derivations are given in the full paper [13].
Notation. We use uppercase letters for random variables,
lowercase letters for their individual values, calligraphic letters
for alphabets, and boldface letters for sequences. The set of
all probability measures over a ﬁnite set X is denoted by
P(X ). Mathematical expectation with respect to probability distribution P is denoted by the symbol EP . Given a
distribution P on the random variable X and a conditional
distribution W on another random variable Y given X, we
denote by P × W the joint distribution on (X, Y ) and by
(P W ) the marginal distribution on Y . The indicator function
of a set A is denoted by 1{x ∈ A}. All logarithms are
natural logarithms. The probability density function (pdf) of
the normal random variable is denoted by φ(x), x ∈ R and
x
its cdf by Φ(x) = −∞ φ.
The symbol f (n) ∼ g(n) denotes asymptotic equality:
limn→∞ f (n) = 1. The notations f (n) = o(g(n)) (small oh)
g(n)
and f (n) = O(g(n)) (big oh) indicate that
zero and ﬁnite, respectively.

probability distribution P on X , denote by (P W )(y) =
x∈X P (x)W (y|x), ∀y ∈ Y the output probability distribution. Given X = x, the conditional pdf above will often
be denoted by Wx ∈ P(Y). Kullback-Leibler divergence

Given two alphabets X and Y, a X -valued random variable

denote by D(W Q|P ) = EP ×W ln W (Y |X) the conditional
Q(Y
KL divergence between W and Q given P , and likewise
by V (W Q|P ) and T (W Q|P ) the conditional divergence
variance and the conditional divergence third moment.
A real random variable L is said to be of the lattice type
if there exists numbers d and l0 such that L belongs to the
lattice {l0 + kd, k ∈ Z} with probability 1. The largest d for
which this holds is called the span of the lattice, and l0 is the
offset.

A sketch of the derivation of the lower and upper bounds is
presented in Secs. III and IV, respectively. It is unclear whether
the gap 1−log(1−ρ2 ) between lower and upper bounds should
be attributed to the use of random codes, or to the union bound,
or both. Either way, the gap can easily be computed explicitly
via (11) and may be as small as one nat (for for additive noise
channels). Hence random codes perform well, and the union
bound is quite tight. Also note that [2, Theorem 48] used a
∗
different method to derive an upper bound on log Mcc (n, ).
However that method does not yield an explicit value for the
O(1) term.

The proposition below is proved by applying the method of
exponential tilting to evaluate the asymptotics of the joint
probability PXX Y [Tn ≥ t , Tn ∈ [t, t + dt)] for an inﬁnitesimal dt, and dividing the result by the asymptotic probability
PXY [Tn ∈ [t, t + dt)].
Proposition 2.6: If |ρ| = 1 then for any t ∈ R,
PXX Y [Tn ≥ t | Tn ∈ [t, t + dt)]

To prove the upper bound in Theorem 1.1, we apply
Theorem 28 for constant-composition codes in [2, p. 2318]

exp{−nI(P ; W ) + nV (P ; W ) t − t2 − ∆cc + o(1)} which implies M (n, ) ≤ 1/β1− (W n (·|x), QY ) where QY
=
is an arbitrary permutation-invariant distribution on Y n , and
2π(1 − ρ2 )nV (P ; W )
as n → ∞.
(33) x is any element of T [P ] where P ∈ Γ(ξ). Using the same
arguments as in [2, Lemma 29] and choosing QY = Qn , we
have

Let the number of codewords be Mn = enRn where The asymptotics of the right side are given in Prop. 2.5.
Rn = log M cc (n, ) + log 1 − ρ2 − 1.
Optimizing over all feasible P proves the claim.

Overview of error probability analysis. By symmetry of
the codebook construction and the decoding rule, the error
probability for message m is independent of m. For the
calculation below, we assume without loss of generality that
m = 1 was sent. We use the bound
