a perfect channel can simulate some noisy one? When our
simulation can consume free entanglement between the sender
and the receiver, this question is answered by the quantum
reverse Shannon theorem. It states that the rate is given by
the entanglement assisted classical capacity CE [5], [6]. Apart
from its deep conceptual appeal, the quantum reverse Shannon
theorem led to the proof that CE is in fact a strong converse
capacity; a concept which we discuss in more detail below.

Abstract—A natural question in characterizing the information
theoretic power of quantum channels is to ask at what rate entanglement is needed in order to asymptotically simulate a quantum
channel in the presence of free classical communication. We call
this the entanglement cost of a channel, and prove a formula
describing it for all channels. We discuss two applications. Firstly,
we are able to link the security in the noisy-storage model to a
problem of sending quantum rather than classical information
through the adversary’s storage device. This not only greatly
improves the range of parameters where security could be shown
previously, but allows us to prove security for storage devices for
which no non-trivial statements were known before. Secondly,
our result has consequences for the study of the strong converse
quantum capacity. Here, we show that any coding scheme that
sends quantum information through a quantum channel at a
rate larger than the entanglement cost of the channel has an
exponentially small ﬁdelity.

It is a natural question to ask what happens to such a
simulation in the presence of other resources. In this work,
we ask what is the optimal asymptotic rate at which a perfect
quantum channel can simulate some noisy quantum channel
E in the presence of free classical communication? We note
that it does not matter if we allow free classical forward,
backward, or even two-way communication; the optimal
asymptotic rate turns out to be the same in all scenarios.
The problem be understood as the ‘reverse problem’ for the
classical communication assisted quantum capacities. Note
that by quantum teleportation [7], the perfect quantum channel
can equivalently be replaced with perfect entanglement. The
central question of this paper can thus be summarized as

I. I NTRODUCTION
One of the most fundamental problems in quantum information theory is to quantify the information theoretic power
of quantum channels. Of particular interest is thereby the
study of a channel’s capacity for information transmission.
This quantity tells us how many bits m we can send reliably
when using the channel n times, using the best possible
encoding and decoding process. Unlike classical channels,
quantum channels have various distinct capacities. These depend, among other things, on what kind of information should
be sent over the channel (e.g. classical or quantum) or on
what kind of assistance is allowed (e.g. free entanglement or
free classical communication). Important examples of quantum
channel capacities include the entanglement assisted classical
capacity CE [1], and the classical forward communication
assisted quantum capacity Q! [2], [3], [4]. The ﬁrst deals
with sending classical information over a quantum channel
in the presence of freely usable entanglement. The latter deals
with the problem of sending quantum information itself, when
we are allowed free classical communication from the sender
to the receiver. One way of tackling the problem of capacities
is to think more broadly in terms of one channel simulating
another. For example, the process of sending m bits reliably
using n uses of a channel E can be understood as a simulation
of m perfect, noise-free, channels using n copies of E. The
capacity of the channel E is then simply the rate m/n at which
such a simulation is possible in the limit of large n. Instead of
simulating a perfect channel from some noisy channel, one can
also approach the problem from the other end. In particular,
we can ask what is the optimal asymptotic rate at which

At what rate is entanglement needed in order to asymptotically
simulate a quantum channel E, when classical communication
is given for free?
We call this rate the entanglement cost EC of a quantum
channel. Our main contribution in this paper is to prove the
following formula
EC (E) = lim

n!1

1
max EF
n n

E ⌦n ⌦ I (

n

) ,

(1)

where the maximization is over all puriﬁcations n of input
states to the n-fold tensor product quantum channel E ⌦n , I
stands for the identity channel on the purifying system, and
EF denotes the entanglement of formation deﬁned as
X
EF (⇢AB ) = infi
pi H(A)⇢i ,
(2)
{pi ,⇢ }

i

where the inﬁmum ranges over all pure state decompositions
P
⇢AB = i pi |⇢i ih⇢i |AB , and H(.) denotes the von Neumann
entropy. As with the known formula for the classical forward
communication assisted quantum capacity, Equation (1)

1

involves a regularization, and hence is not a single-letter
formula. Note that even if we would know that we can restrict
the maximization to non-entangled input states, Equation (1)
would still not be a single-letter formula, due to Hasting’s
counterexample for the additivity of the entanglement of
formation [8], [9]. However, we want to emphasize that
we can compute explicit upper bounds for EC , which are
particularly useful for the applications given below. The
entanglement cost is in general larger than the classical
communication assisted quantum capacities, which is in
contrast to the case of free entanglement (where the rate is
CE for both, the channel capacity and the reverse problem).
Hence, simulating the perfect channel from a noisy one and
then again the noisy channel, results in a net loss.

E ⌦n , whose asymptotic rate of entanglement consumption is
upper bounded by EC (E). That is, we need to construct a
completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map that is
asymptotically arbitrarily close to E ⌦n in the diamond norm
(which is the dual of the completely bounded norm [23]),
and that consists only of using maximally entangled states
at an asymptotic rate of at most EC (E), local operations,
and classical communication. Here it is worth to note that
even though the channel to simulate E ⌦n has iid structure,
the channel simulation also has to work on non-iid inputs
(and this is also the reason why Equation (1) does not just
easily follow from Equation (3)). The crucial idea is to employ
the post-selection technique for quantum channels [24], which
is a tool to bound the distance in diamond norm between
two completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps
that act symmetrically on an n-partite system. The technique
upper bounds this distance by the distance arising from the
puriﬁcation of a special de Finetti input state. That is, the
puriﬁcation of a state which consists of n identical and independent copies of an (unknown) state on a single subsystem.
Note that this puriﬁcation does not have iid structure. But now
it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd a CPTP map that creates the state given
by E ⌦n applied to the puriﬁcation of the special de Finetti
input state. It then remains to quantify how much entanglement
is needed in order to create this state. Since this state does not
have iid structure, we employ the one-shot entanglement cost
(1)
for quantum states EC (⇢AB , "), which quantiﬁes how much
entanglement is needed in order to create one single copy of a
bipartite quantum state ⇢AB up to an error " 0 using local
operations and classical communication [25], [26]. Note that
this is in contrast to the quantity EC (⇢AB ) mentioned before,
which answers the question of how much entanglement is
needed in the asymptotic iid regime. The resulting asymptotic
entanglement cost of the channel simulation is then upper
bounded by an expression close to Equation (1), but with
the maximization over input states and the minimization in
the deﬁnition of the entanglement of formation interchanged.
Finally, in order to arrive at Equation (1), we discretize the
set of Kraus decompositions of E and apply Sion’s minimax
theorem [27].

As the name entanglement cost suggests, EC (E) can be seen
as the channel analogue of the entanglement cost of quantum
states EC (⇢), which is deﬁned as the optimal asymptotic rate
of entanglement that is needed in order to create a quantum
state ⇢ in the iid scenario using local operations and classical
communication [10], [11]. It is known that
EC (⇢) = lim

n!1

1
EF (⇢⌦n ) ,
n

(3)

where EF again denotes the entanglement of formation. In the
state problem, it is interesting to compare the entanglement
cost EC (⇢) with the distillable entanglement ED (⇢), which is
the optimal asymptotic rate at which perfect entanglement can
be distilled in the iid scenario using local operations and classical communication [12]. As it turns out, there are quantum
states with EC (⇢) > ED (⇢), and even with ED (⇢) = 0 but
EC (⇢) > 0. These states are called bound entangled [13]. The
corresponding quantum channel problem is then to compare
EC (E) with e.g. Q! (E), since by teleportation, Q! (E) is
actually the same as the entanglement generating capacity
E! (E) [2]. And indeed there are bound entangled quantum
channels, e.g. all channels with positive partial transpose
(PPT [14], [15]) but entangled Choi-Jamiolkowski state, because then EC (E) > 0 but Q! (E) = 0. In further analogy
with the state problem, we can also show that EC (E) is zero
if and only if E is entanglement breaking.

We use one-shot information theory to derive our main
result Equation (1). In contrast to the usual assumption of
asymptotic iid resources in quantum information theory, oneshot information theory applies to arbitrary (structureless)
resources. In the asymptotic iid regime many operational
quantities can be expressed in terms of a few information
measures based on the von Neumann entropy. The same holds
true for the one-shot case by means of the smooth entropy formalism [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. We work in this
smooth entropy formalism and our proof is conceptually very
similar to the proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem
given in [6]. In order to prove the direct part of Equation (1),
we need to show the existence of a channel simulation for

We present two applications of our formula for the entanglement cost of channels and calculate some examples of interest.
We start with the problem of proving security in the noisy
storage model and then turn to the problem of deriving bounds
for the strong converse of quantum capacities.
A. Security in the Noisy Storage Model
As a ﬁrst application we discuss security in the noisystorage model [28], [29], [30]. For the ﬁrst time, we relate
security in this model to a problem of sending quantum rather
than classical information through the adversary’s storage
device. In particular, we show that any two-party cryptographic

To determine a quantum channel’s capacity for sending
information, two aspects need to be addressed. First of
all, one needs to show that the capacity can be achieved.
That is, there exists some coding scheme that allows to
transmit information reliably at any rate up to the capacity.
Second, however, the capacity should really form a threshold
for information transmission. That is, if one tries to send
information at a rate above the capacity, then there exists no
coding scheme that allows to send information without any
error. Such a statement is also known as a weak converse.
This however, does not yet exclude the possibility of
sending information with a small error at a rate that exceeds
the capacity. The minimal rate for which the success in
transmitting information drops exponentially with the number
of channel uses, is known as the strong converse capacity.
The strong converse capacity is appealing since it really
gives a sharp threshold for information transmission. But to
determine the strong converse capacity forms a challenge
even when it comes to sending classical information. Only
when restricted to non-entangled input states [33], [34] or
certain classes of quantum channels [35], it is known that
the strong converse classical capacity is actually the same as
the classical capacity. However, upper bounds on the strong

security can be obtained, we also obtain non-trivial bounds for
dephasing noise, and can ﬁnd bounds for the security for any
qubit channel such as amplitude damping noise (see Fig. 2-4).

converse classical capacity are known [5], [36], [37]. For
example, the quantum reverse Shannon theorem shows that
the entanglement assisted classical capacity CE and its strong
converse version are identical [5]. Of course CE is then also
an upper bound on the unassisted strong converse classical
capacity. In addition, the result immediately implies that the
entanglement assisted quantum capacity QE = CE /2 and its
strong converse version are identical. Thus, QE is an upper
bound on the unassisted strong converse quantum capacity.

The second application of our result is a new upper bound to
the strong converse capacity for sending quantum information.
Similar to the quantum reverse Shannon theorem, we employ
the idea of a channel simulation to prove that when we send
quantum information at a rate exceeding EC , the error rate is
lower bounded by

Shannon theorem can then be understood as e.g. (QE , 1, 0)
or (0, 1, CE ) (to be precise, the entanglement has to be
given in the form of so-called embezzling states [38], [5]),
whereas our entanglement cost corresponds to e.g. (0, EC , 1)
or (EC , 0, 1). Some more examples are discussed in [5,
Figure 2] and a particularly interesting case is the following.
For e = 0, c = 0, and product state inputs, the channel
simulation can be done for [5, Theorem 3]

Our bound holds for all channels E and the two-way classical
communication assisted quantum capacity Q$ (and with that
also for Q! ). We note that he bound EC is independent of QE
and can in general be stronger or weaker. As an example we

Fig. 5 this is far from being tight, but we are not aware of any

However, this does not work for same reason as the quantum

as entanglement spread [5], [40], [41], [42].

V. C ONCLUSION AND O UTLOOK

We calculated the rate of entanglement needed in order
to asymptotically simulate a quantum channel when classical
communication is for free. Because of the free classical
communication, the problem is equivalent to the question
about the rate of quantum communication needed in order to
simulate a quantum channel. A natural subsequent question
is to ask what rate of classical communication is actually
needed. However, in the spirit about general quantum channel
simulations, we might even want to ask more generally about
rate triples (q, e, c) needed in order to achieve the channel
simulation, where q denotes quantum communication, e entanglement, and c classical communication. The quantum reverse

Another interesting open question concerns the relation
of EC (E) and Q! (E). We know that EC (E)
Q! (E),
with the inequality typically being strict. Can we obtain a
characterization of channels for which EC (E) = Q! (E)?
This is an analogue of the problem of characterizing bipartite
states for which the distillable entanglement is equal the
entanglement cost, which is still wide open.
Note added. After completion of this work, security in the
noisy storage model was linked to the strong converse quantum

4

capacity of the adversary’s storage device [43]. This means
that our bound on the strong converse from Section IV-B can
also be applied directly to calculate rates for security. However,
our arguments from Section IV-A apply to virtually any form
of the noisy storage model, whereas the results from [43] are
only applicable for the so-called six-state encoding.
