In this paper, we ﬁrst consider K-user SISO IC and M × K
SISO X channel with delayed CSIT and full-duplex transmitter
cooperation. We propose multi-phase transmission schemes
that achieve DoFs greater than the best reported achievable
DoFs for these channels with delayed CSIT but without
transmitter cooperation [5]. Then, we investigate K-user IC
and K × K X channel with output feedback and Shannon
feedback and propose multi-phase transmission schemes that
achieve DoF values strictly increasing in K.

Abstract—The Gaussian single-input single-output (SISO) Kuser interference and M × K X channels are investigated in
i.i.d. fading environment with no instantaneous channel state
information (CSI) at transmitters. First, it is assumed that
the CSI is fed back to all nodes after some delay (delayed
CSIT), and furthermore, the transmitters operate in full-duplex
mode. Achievable results on the degrees of freedom (DoF) of
these channels under the above assumption are obtained. Then,
achievable DoFs are obtained for the K-user interference and
K × K X channels with output feedback and also Shannon
feedback, which is a combination of output feedback and delayed
CSIT, and compared with the achievable DoFs under the fullduplex delayed CSIT assumption.

freedom, full-duplex, feedback, delayed CSIT.

II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
A K-user SISO AWGN interference channel is composed
of K transmitters and K receivers, where transmitter i (TXi ),
1 ≤ i ≤ K, wishes to communicate a message to receiver
i (RXi ). In time slot t, x[i] (t) ∈ C with E|x[i] (t)|2 ≤ P is
transmitted by TXi , and y [j] (t) ∈ C is received by RXj , where

I. I NTRODUCTION
The impact of delayed CSI feedback, known as delayed
CSIT, on the DoF of a variety of multi-user channels with
i.i.d. fading has been recently investigated [1]–[8]. As a ﬁrst
order approximation, the DoF of a channel characterizes its
sum-capacity, normalized by logarithm of signal-to-noise-ratio
(SNR), in high SNR regime. Achievable DoFs for the 3-user
SISO interference channel (IC) and 2×2 SISO X channel with
output feedback have been reported in [3]. The DoF region of
the two-user MIMO IC with both delayed CSIT and output
feedback, known as Shannon feedback, has been studied in
[9], [10].
Feedback in multi-user channels with distributed transmitters naturally provides some level of transmitter cooperation.
As such, there are connections between communication over
these channels with feedback and that with full-duplex transmitter cooperation. However, it has been shown that under the
full CSIT assumption, full-duplex cooperation and/or output
feedback cannot increase DoF of the SISO interference and
X channels [11]. Also, with no CSIT, full-duplex transmitter
cooperation does not help to achieve more than one DoF, since
the broadcast channel DoF is equal to one [12].

1 ≤ j ≤ K,

i=1

and z [j] (t) ∼ CN (0, 1) is the i.i.d. Gaussian noise. The CSI is
deﬁned as the matrix H(t)
h[ji] (t) 1≤i,j≤K with random
elements which are i.i.d. across all nodes as well as time and
have a ﬁnite-variance continuous distribution. Each receiver
RXj knows {h[ji] (t)}K instantaneously but the other channel
i=1
coefﬁcients with one time slot delay.
An M × K SISO AWGN X channel is a set of M
transmitters and K receivers, where each transmitter has a
message to communicate to each receiver. The input-output
relationship of this channel is given by Eq. (1) with the
summation ranging over the M transmitters.
We study three different feedback/transmitter cooperation
models deﬁned as follows:
• Full-duplex Delayed CSIT: The channel matrix H(t) becomes available at all transmitters with one time slot delay via
noiseless feedback (delayed CSIT). Moreover, the transmitters
operate in full-duplex mode, i.e., they can transmit and receive
simultaneously. Each transmitter has instantaneous access to
its incoming full-duplex channel coefﬁcients.

• Output Feedback: Channel output y [i] (t), 1 ≤ i ≤ K, is
causally available at TXi via noiseless feedback.
• Shannon Feedback: The transmitters have access to both
delayed CSIT and output feedback.
Note that in the output and Shannon feedback models
deﬁned above, it has been implicitly assumed that the number of transmitters is equal to the number of receivers. If
R(P ) = (R1 , R2 , · · · , RN ) is an achievable rate tuple, then
d limP →∞ R(P )/ log2 P is called an achievable DoF tuple
N
and n=1 dn is called an achievable DoF. The channel DoF
region D is the closure of the set of all achievable DoF tuples
N
d, and the channel DoF is maxd∈D n=1 dn .
These notations are widely used throughout this paper:
Sm ⊆ SK = {1, 2, · · · , K} denotes a subset of cardinality m
of user indices. u[Sm1 |Sm2 ;Sm3 ] represents a symbol which is
available at each TXi , i ∈ Sm1 , and each RXj , j ∈ Sm3 , and
is intended to be decoded at each RXj , j ∈ Sm2 . If Sm3 = {},
this symbol is denoted by u[Sm1 |Sm2 ] .

IV. P ROOF OF T HEOREM 1
Let us ﬁrst elaborate on our achievable scheme for the fullduplex 3-user IC with delayed CSIT and show that 6/5 DoF,
suggested by Eq. (2), is achievable in this channel. Then, we
propose our achievable scheme for the K-user case.
A. 3-user IC with Full-duplex Delayed CSIT
Consider a 2-phase transmission scheme, wherein 6 information symbols are delivered to the receivers in 5 time slots:
• Phase 1: During 3 time slots, 6 information symbols are
fed to the channel as follows: In the ﬁrst time slot, TX1
[1]
[2]
and TX2 transmit u1 and u1 , respectively, while TX3 is
silent. RX1 and RX2 each receive one linear equation in
[1]
[2]
terms of u1 and u1 . Therefore, if we deliver a linearly
[1]

independent equation in terms of u1 and u1 to both RX1

III. M AIN R ESULTS
The main results of this paper are summarized in the following six theorems. Theorems 1, 3 and 5 will be respectively
proved in Sections IV to VI. The proofs of Theorems 2, 4 and 6
are referred to [13].

m
L
symbols are transmitted in Qm (K) time slots. Now, the folm (K)
lowing observations are important:
(a) RXj , j ∈ Sm+1 , wishes to decode the Lm (K) symbols
[S
\{j }|Sm+1 \{j };j ] Lm (K)/m
{uk m+1
}k=1
, j ∈ Sm+1 \{j}. Since it
[S
\{j}|Sm+1 \{j};j] Lm (K)/m
has all the symbols {uk m+1
}k=1
, by canLm (K)
celing them, it will obtain Qm (K) equations out of its received
equations, solely in terms of its desired symbols.
(b) TXi , i ∈ Sm+1 , has all the transmitted symbols except
[S
\{i}|Sm+1 \{i};i] Lm (K)/m
for {uk m+1
}k=1
. According to the fullL
duplex operation, it will obtain Qm (K) random linear combim (K)
nations of these symbols after canceling its known symbols,
L
and since Qm (K) ≥ Lm (K) , it can decode all of them.
m
m (K)

and RX2 , each of them will be able to decode both transmitted symbols. This equation is indeed the linear combination
[1]
[2]
h[31] (1)u1 + h[32] (1)u1 received by RX3 during this time
slot. On the other hand, according to full-duplex operation of
[1]
[2]
the transmitters, both TX1 and TX2 will have both u1 and u1
by the end of the ﬁrst time slot. This along with the delayed
CSIT assumption enables both TX1 and TX2 to reconstruct
[1]
[2]
h[31] (1)u1 + h[32] (1)u1 . Thus, one can deﬁne
u[1,2|1,2;3]

[1]

[2]

h[31] (1)u1 + h[32] (1)u1 .

(11)

Similarly, for the second and third time slots we have:
[2]

[3]

Second time slot: TX2 and TX3 transmit u2 and u1 ,
respectively (TX1 is silent), and u[2,3|2,3;1] is generated.
[3]
[1]
• Third time slot: TX3 and TX1 transmit u2 and u2 ,
[3,1|3,1;2]
respectively (TX2 is silent), and u
is generated.
Therefore, it only remains to deliver u[1,2|1,2;3] , u[2,3|2,3;1] ,
and u[3,1|3,1;2] to their respective pairs of receivers.
• Phase 2: During 2 time slots, TX1 , TX2 , and TX3
repeat u[2,3|2,3;1] , u[3,1|3,1;2] , and u[1,2|1,2;3] , respectively. Each
receiver obtains two random linear combinations of its two
desired symbols, and thus, will decode its desired symbols.
•

L
(c) RXj , j ∈ SQm (K)−1 , receives Qm (K) linear equations
m (K)
in terms of all transmitted symbols. If we deliver these linear
combinations to RXj , j ∈ Sm+1 , it will be able to cancel its
L
undesired part as argued in observation (a) and obtain Qm (K)
m (K)
equations solely in terms of its desired symbols. On the other
hand, in view of observation (b) and according to the delayed
CSIT assumption, TXi , i ∈ Sm+1 , will have access to all these
L
linear combinations by the end of the Qm (K) time slots. Thus,

Consider the following (K −1)-phase transmission scheme:
• Phase 1: For every subset S3 = {i1 , i2 , i3 } ⊆ SK , spend
3 time slots to transmit 6 fresh information symbols
[i ]
[i ]
[i ]
{uk 1 , uk 2 , uk 3 }k=1,2 by {TXi1 , TXi2 , TXi3 } and generate
3 symbols u[i1 ,i2 |i1 ,i2 ;i3 ] , u[i2 ,i3 |i2 ,i3 ;i1 ] , and u[i3 ,i1 |i3 ,i1 ;i2 ] in
the same way as phase 1 of the scheme for the 3-user IC.
Therefore, 6 K information symbols are transmitted in 3 K
3
3
time slots and 3 K symbols of type u[S2 |S2 ;j] , j ∈ SK \S2 , are
3
generated by the end of phase 1. We denote by DoFICFD (K),
m
2 ≤ m ≤ K − 1, our achievable DoF for transmission of
symbols of type u[Sm |Sm ;j] , j ∈ SK \Sm , over the K-user
IC with full-duplex delayed CSIT. The achieved DoF is then
calculated as

m
m
are denoted by {uk m+1 m+1 }k=1
. After deliverLm (K)
ing these (Qm (K)−1)× Qm (K) symbols to RXj , j ∈ Sm+1 , it
will be provided with a total of Lm (K) linear combinations in
terms of its Lm (K) desired symbols. Also, it is easy to show
that these linear combinations are linearly independent almost
surely, and hence, can be solved for the desired symbols.

Since there are m+1 choices of Sm+1 and Qm (K)−1

• Phase K − 1: During K − 1 time slots, each TXi ,
i ∈ SK , repeats the symbol u[SK \{i−1}|SK \{i−1};i−1] (with
u[SK \{0}|SK \{0};0]
u[SK \{K}|SK \{K};K] ). Hence, each receiver obtains K − 1 linear combinations of its K − 1 desired
symbols and can decode all them. One then can write

Our transmission scheme for the K-user IC with output
feedback consists of K − µ(K) + 1 phases, where the integer
µ(K), 2 ≤ µ(K) ≤ K/2 , will be determined later. We note

3

that for K = 3, our scheme reduces to a modiﬁed version of
the scheme proposed in [3] and achieves the same 6/5 DoF.

VI. P ROOF OF T HEOREM 5
Our achievable scheme for the K-user IC with Shannon
feedback has two rounds of operation as follows:
Round 1: In this round, the transmitters use only the
output feedback in parallel with the scheme proposed in
Section V. In speciﬁc, during phase 1, for every subset
Sν(K) ⊂ SK , every subset Sν(K)−1 ⊆ SK \Sν(K) , and every
j0 ∈ Sν(K)−1 , in one time slot, each TXi , i ∈ Sν(K) ,
transmits a fresh information symbol u[i] . The integer ν(K),
2 ≤ ν(K) ≤ K/2 , will be determined later. The linear
combination received by RXj , j ∈ Sν(K)−1 , which will be
available at TXj via the output feedback, is desired by every
RXi , i ∈ Sν(K) .
Now, TXi , i ∈ Sν(K) , using Shannon feedback and having u[i] , obtains an equation in terms of the symbols u[i ] ,
i ∈ Sν(K) \{i}. We deliver the ν(K) − 2 linear combinations
available at the receivers RXj , j ∈ Sν(K)−1 \{j0 }, to RXi , i ∈
Sν(K) , using the scheme proposed in Section V. Meanwhile,
TXi using Shannon feedback and having u[i] , will obtain
another ν(K) − 2 linearly independent combinations of u[i ] ,
i ∈ Sν(K) \{i}, and hence, can decode all of them. Thereby,
it can reconstruct the linear combination available at RXj0 ,
which is still required by every RXi , i ∈ Sν(K) . Hence, this
linear combination will be denoted as u[Sν(K) ∪{j0 }|Sν(K) ;j0 ] .
We note that, for every subset Sν(K)+1 ⊆ SK , and every
subset Sν(K)−2 ⊆ SK \Sν(K)+1 , we have generated ν(K) + 1
symbols u[Sν(K)+1 |Sν(K)+1 \{j0 };j0 ] , j0 ∈ Sν(K)+1 . Since every
RXi , i ∈ Sν(K)+1 , needs exactly ν(K) out of these ν(K) + 1
symbols, ν(K) random linear combinations of these symbols
are desired by each RXi , i ∈ Sν(K)+1 , and can be denoted
[S
|S
] ν(K)
as {uk ν(K)+1 ν(K)+1 }k=1 . They will be delivered during the
round 2. The achieved DoF is therefore given by

• Phase 1: For every subset Sµ(K) ⊂ SK , and every subset
Sµ(K)−1 ⊆ SK \Sµ(K) , in one time slot, each TXi , i ∈ Sµ(K) ,
transmits a fresh information symbol u[i] . Then, if we deliver
µ(K) − 1 linearly independent combinations of the µ(K)
transmitted symbols to RXi , i ∈ Sµ(K) , it will be able
to decode all the transmitted symbols. Thus, the equation
received by RXj , j ∈ Sµ(K)−1 , which will be available at
TXj via the output feedback, is desired by all the receivers
RXi , i ∈ Sµ(K) . Hence, they can be denoted as u[j|Sµ(K) ;j] ,
j ∈ Sµ(K)−1 .

Round 2: This round consists of K − ν(K) phases
described as follows:
• Phase m, ν(K) + 1 ≤ m ≤ K − 1: In this phase, symbols of type u[Sm |Sm ] are fed to the channel and symbols
of type u[Sm+1 |Sm+1 ] are generated as follows: Fix a subset
SQm (K+1)+m−1 ⊆ SK , where Qm (n), n ∈ Z, is deﬁned in
Eq. (14). For any Sm ⊂ SQm (K+1)+m−1 , spend one time
[S |S ] Qm (K+1)
slot to transmit {uk m m }k=1
by Qm (K + 1) arbitrary
transmitters out of {TXj : j ∈ Sm }. Then, RXj , j ∈ Sm ,
requires Qm (K + 1) − 1 extra equations to resolve all the
transmitted symbols. Thus, the linear combination received
by RXj , j ∈ SQm (K+1)+m−1 \Sm , which will be available

• Phase K − 1: During K − 1 time slots, TXi , i ∈ SK , repeats the symbol u[i|SK \{i};i] . Therefore, each receiver obtains
K − 1 linear combinations of its K − 1 desired symbols, and
K
can decode all its desired symbols. Hence, DoFICOF = K−1 .
K−1
It is easy to see that the achieved DoF, i.e., DoFICOF (K),
m
satisﬁes Eq. (15), and thus, is given in closed form by Eq. (8).
Equation (4) then follows from maximizing DoFICOF (K) over
1
µ(K). The maximization details can be found in [13].

at TXj via the output feedback, is desired by every RXj ,
j ∈ Sm . Also, every TXj , j ∈ Sm , having access to all the
transmitted symbols and delayed CSI, can reconstruct this linear combination. Therefore, it is denoted as u[Sm ∪{j }|Sm ;j ] .
Now, for any subset Sm+1 ⊆ SQm (K+1)+m−1 , consider
m + 1 symbols u[Sm+1 |Sm+1 \{j};j] , j ∈ Sm+1 . It is easy to
see that m random linear combinations of these symbols
are desired by each RXi , i ∈ Sm+1 , and can be denoted as

The fast fading SISO IC and X channel were investigated
without instantaneous CSIT. Transmission schemes were proposed under three different assumptions, namely, full-duplex
delayed CSIT, output feedback, and Shannon feedback, which
achieve strictly increasing DoFs with number of receivers. The
DoF characterization of both channels under each considered
assumption remains open in the lack of tight upper bounds.

It can be shown that the closed form solution to the recursive
Eq. (19) with initial condition (20) is given by Eq. (9).
Therefore, the proof is complete in view of Eq. (18) and the
fact that ν(K) is chosen to maximize DoFICSF (K).

VII. C OMPARISON OF R ESULTS
Figures 1 and 2 plot our achievable DoFs for the K-user IC
and K × K X channel with full-duplex delayed CSIT, output
and Shannon feedbacks, and compare them with the best
reported achievable DoFs for the same channels with delayed
CSIT [5] for 2 ≤ K ≤ 30. It is seen that our achievable
DoFs are strictly increasing in K and greater than those with
delayed CSIT. Also, as K → ∞, we have DoFICFD (K) →
