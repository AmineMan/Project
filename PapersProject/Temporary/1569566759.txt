For a system with m = 2 antennas and two users, the proposed
scheme, hereafter called MAT, achieves the multiplexing gain
of 4 , irrespectively of the fading speed. This work shifts the
3
paradigm of broadcast precoding from space-only to spacetime alignment. The role of delayed CSIT can then be reinterpreted as a “feedback” of the past signal/interference heard
by the receiver. This side information enables the transmitter
to perform “retrospective” alignment in the space and time
domain, as demonstrated in different multiuser network systems
(see e.g. [2]). Although it exhibits optimal rate scaling behavior,
the MAT algorithm is designed based on the worst case scenario
where the delayed channel feedback provides no information
about the current one. This assumption is over pessimistic
as most practical channels exhibit some form of temporal
correlation. It should be noticed that MAT does not exploit
any current CSIT whereas ZF builds only on the current CSIT.
In fact with a simple selection strategy between ZF and MAT,
4
a multiplexing gain of max{2(1 − 2F ), 3 } is achievable. For
either very slowly or very rapidly varying channels, a scheme
selection approach is reasonable. Yet, for intermediate ranges
of temporal correlation, a question arises as how to best exploit
both past channel samples and an estimate of the current one,
obtained through a linear prediction.
In order to model the quality of the current CSIT, we
introduce a parameter α which indicates the rate of decay
of the channel estimation error when the transmitted power
grows. Thus α = 0, ∞ corresponds to no and perfect CSIT
respectively. We propose a seamless scheme which bridges
smoothly between the two extremal schemes ZF and MAT and
we characterize the achievable degrees of freedom. As it will be
shown later, the proposed scheme combines the ZF and MAT
principles into a single multi-slotted protocol which relies on
the retransmission and alignement of the residual interference
caused by the ZF precoder due to the imperfectness of current
channel state information.
In the following, after a brief presentation of the assumptions
on the CSI and fading process, we present the proposed scheme
as an extension the MAT principle. The achievable degrees of
freedom (DoF) of the proposed scheme are analyzed afterward.
Finally, we interpret the obbtained DoF in a practical temporally
correlated fading channel scenario where α can be related to
the maximum Doppler shift over the time varying channel.
Throughout the paper, we will use the following notations.

Abstract— We consider the time correlated MISO broadcast
channel where the transmitter has partial knowledge on the
current channel state, in addition to delayed channel state
information (CSI). Rather than exploiting only the current CSI,
as the zero-forcing precoding, or only the delayed CSI, as the
Maddah-Ali-Tse (MAT) scheme, we propose a seamless strategy
that takes advantage of both. The achievable degrees of freedom
of the proposed scheme is characterized in terms of the quality
of the current channel knowledge.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In most practical scenarios, perfect channel state information
at transmitter (CSIT) may not be available due to the timevarying nature of wireless channels as well as the limited
resource for channel estimation. However, many wireless
applications must guarantee high-data rate and reliable communication in the presence of channel uncertainty. In this paper,
we consider such scenario in the context of the two-user MISO
broadcast channel, where the transmitter equipped with m
antennas wishes to send two private messages to two receivers
each with a single antenna. The discrete time baseband signal
model is given by
yt = hT xt + et
t

(1a)

T
zt = gt xt + bt ,

(1b)

for any time instant t, where ht , gt ∈ Cm×1 are the channel
vectors for user 1 and 2, respectively; et , bt ∼ NC (0, 1) are
normalized additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at the
respective receivers; the input signal xt is subject to the
2
power constraint E xt
≤ P , ∀ t. For the case of perfect
CSIT, the optimal multiplexing gain of the channel at hand
is two achieved by linear strategies such as zero-forcing (ZF)
beamforming. It is also well known that the full multiplexing
gain can be maintained under imperfect CSIT if the error in
CSIT decreases at the rate P −1 as P grows [4], [5]. Further, in
the realistic case where the fading process is correlated with a
maximum Doppler frequency shift 0 ≤ F < 1 , ZF can achieve
2
a fraction 2(1 − 2F ) of the optimal multiplexing gain [4]. This
result somehow reveals the bottleneck of a family of precoding
schemes relying only on instantaneous CSIT as the fading speed
1
increases (F → 2 ). Recently, a breakthrough has been made in
order to overcome precisely such a problem. In [1], MaddahAli and Tse showed a surprising result that even completely
outdated CSIT can be very useful in terms of multiplexing gain.

with only one dimension (hT v for user 1 and g1 u for user 2).

And importantly, the reduction in interference is done without
sacriﬁcing the dimension of the useful signals. Speciﬁcally, a
two-dimensional interference-free observation of u (resp. v)
is obtained at receiver 1 (resp. receiver 2).
Interestingly, the alignment can be done in a different manner.

For convenience, we provide the following deﬁnition on the
channel states.
Deﬁnition 1 (channel states): The channel vectors ht and
gt are called the states of the channel at instant t. For simplicity,
hT
t
we also deﬁne the state matrix St as St
.
T
gt
The assumptions on the fading process and the knowledge of
the channel states are summarized as follows.
Assumption 1 (mutually independent fading): At any given
time instant t, the channel vectors for the two users ht , gt are
mutually independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with
zero mean and covariance matrix Im . Moreover, we assume
that rank (St ) = 2 with probability 1.
Assumption 2 (perfect delayed and imperfect current CSI):
At each time instant t, the transmitter knows the delayed
channel states up to instant t − 1. In addition, the transmitter
ˆ
can somehow obtain an estimation St of the current channel

In the ﬁrst slot, the transmitter sends the mixed signal to both
users. In the second slot, the transmitter sends the interference
seen by receiver 1 in the ﬁrst slot. The role of this stage is
two-fold: resolving interference for user 1 and reinforcing
signal for user 2. In the third slot, the transmitter sends
the interference seen by user 2 to help the users the other
way around. Therefore, this variant of the MAT alignment is
composed of two phases: i) broadcasting the mixed signal, and
T
ii) multicasting the mutual interference (hT v, g1 u). At the end

For each user, the useful signal lies in a two-dimensional
subspace while the interference is aligned in a one-dimensional
subspace. Since the latter is not completely included in the
signal subspace, it is readily shown that two degrees of freedom
are achievable in the three-dimensional time space, yielding 2
3
as the average degrees of freedom. This variant, although trivial
from the original MAT scheme, is crucial to the integration of
the current CSI, if there is any.

The ﬁrst step is to quantize (hT v, g1 u). Although it is

possible to apply directly a 2-dimensional quantizer, we
choose to quantize both signals individually for simplicty of

VI. C ONCLUSION
We considered a practical scenario of the time-correlated
MISO broadcast channel where the transmitter takes an
opportunity to exploit both past (delayed) channel state and
an estimate of current channel state. We proposed a novel
multi-slotted strategy which enhances the degrees of freedom
promised by the MAT scheme according to the quality of the
current channel knowlege.

V. E XAMPLE : T EMPORALLY C ORRELATED FADING
The main result on the achievable DoF has been presented
in terms of an artiﬁcial parameter α, denoting the speed of
decay of the estimation error σ 2 ∼ P −α in the current CSIT.
In this section, we provide an example showing the practical
interpretation of this parameter. Focusing on receiver 1 due to
symmetry, we describe the fading process, channel estimation,
and feedback scheme as follows:
• The channel fading ht follows a Doppler process with
power spectral density Sh (w). The channel coefﬁcients
vf T
are strictly band-limited to [−F, F ] with F = c f < 1
c

where v, fc , Tf , c denotes the mobile speed in m/h, the
carrier frequency in Hz, the slot duration in sec, the light
speed in m/sec.
• The channel estimation is done at the receivers side
with pilot-based downlink training. At slot t, receiver 1
estimates ht based on a sequence of the noisy observations
√
{sτ = P γhτ + ντ } up to t, where a constant γ ≥ 1
denotes the resource factor dedicated to the training and
νt is AWGN with zero mean unit covariance. The estimate

Lemma 1: The DoF of the multicast communication in the
considered two-user MISO channel is DoFmc = 1. That is, for
any δ > 0, there exists a code with rate (1 − δ) log P , such
that the average error probability goes to 0 when P → ∞.
Proof: Since each receiver has only one antenna, the DoF
per user for the multicast communication is upper-bounded
by 1. For the lower bound, let us consider a trivial scheme in
which only one transmit antenna out of m is used. The MISO
BC becomes a SISO BC that is degraded. And the multicast
capacity is just that of the worse user, which yields 1 as DoF
as well. This can be achieved with a single-letter code.

In this channel with imperfect delayed CSIT, we can still
apply the proposed scheme and analysis in exactly the same
way as above except for the following principal changes. First,
˜
˜T
the known interference becomes η1 = hT v and η2 = g1 u and

˜
˜T
the received signal y1 becomes y1 = hT u + η1 + e1 + δ1 x1 .
