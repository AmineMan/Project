Abstract—We formulate a uniﬁed framework for the separation of signals that are sparse in “morphologically” different
redundant dictionaries. This formulation incorporates the socalled “analysis” and “synthesis” approaches as special cases and
contains novel hybrid setups. We ﬁnd corresponding coherencebased recovery guarantees for an 1 -norm based separation
algorithm. Our results recover those reported in Studer and
Baraniuk, ACHA, submitted, for the synthesis setting, provide
new recovery guarantees for the analysis setting, and form a
basis for comparing performance in the analysis and synthesis
settings. As an aside our ﬁndings complement the D-RIP recovery
results reported in Candès et al., ACHA, 2011, for the “analysis”

I. I NTRODUCTION
We consider the problem of splitting the signal x = x1 +x2
into its constituents x1 ∈ Cd and x2 ∈ Cd —assumed
to be sparse in “morphologically” different (redundant) dictionaries [1]—based on m linear, nonadaptive, and noisy
measurements y = Ax + e. Here, A ∈ Cm×d , m ≤ d, is the
measurement matrix, assumed to be known, and e ∈ Cm is a
noise vector, assumed to be unknown and to satisfy e 2 ≤ ε,
with ε known.
Redundant dictionaries [2], [3] often lead to sparser representations than nonredundant ones, such as, e.g., orthonormal
bases, and have therefore become pervasive in the sparse signal
recovery literature [3]. In the context of signal separation,
redundant dictionaries lead to an interesting dichotomy [1],
[4], [5]:
• In the so-called “synthesis” setting, it is assumed that,
for = 1, 2, x = D s , where D ∈ Cd×n (d < n) is
a redundant dictionary (of full rank) and the coefﬁcient
vector s ∈ Cn is sparse (or approximately sparse in the
sense of [6]). Given the vector y ∈ Cm , the problem of
ﬁnding the constituents x1 and x2 is formalized as [7]:

which encompasses (PS) and (PA). To recover (PS) from (P),
one sets A = AD and Ψ = [Id 0d,n−d ]T , for = 1, 2.
(PA) is obtained by choosing A = A, for = 1, 2. Our
main contribution is a coherence-based recovery guarantee
for the general problem (P). This result recovers [7, Th. 4],
which deals with (PS), provides new recovery guarantees
for (PA), and constitutes a basis for comparing performance
in the analysis and synthesis settings. As an aside, it also
complements the D-RIP recovery guarantee in [5, Th. 1.2]
for the problem

Throughout the paper, we exclusively consider redundant dictionaries as for D , = 1, 2, square, the synthesis setting can
be recovered from the analysis setting by taking Ψ = D−1 .
The problems (PS) and (PA) arise in numerous applications
including denoising [8], super-resolution [8], inpainting [9]–
[11], deblurring [11], and recovery of sparsely corrupted
signals [12]. Coherence-based recovery guarantees for (PS)
were reported in [7]. The problem (PA) was mentioned in [5].
In the noiseless case, recovery guarantees for (PA), expressed
in terms of a concentration inequality, are given in [13] for
A = Id and Ψ1 and Ψ2 both Parseval frames [2].

We let σmin (M) denote the smallest singular value of M,

to the k largest (in magnitude) coefﬁcients of x. Sets are
designated by uppercase calligraphic letters; the cardinality
of the set S is |S| and the complement of S (in some given

matrix PS for the set S ⊂ {1, . . . , n} is deﬁned as follows:

II. R ECOVERY G UARANTEES
Coherence deﬁnitions in the sparse signal recovery literature [3] usually apply to dictionaries with normalized columns.
Here, we will need coherence notions valid for general (unnormalized) dictionaries M and N, assumed, for simplicity of
exposition, to consist of nonzero columns only.
Deﬁnition 1 (Coherence): The coherence of the dictionary M is deﬁned as

where C0 , C1 ≥ 0 are constants that do not depend on x1

Note that the quantities µ1 , µ2 , and µm characterize the inˆ ˆ
ˆ
terplay between the measurement matrix A and the sparsifying
transforms Ψ1 and Ψ2 .
As a corollary to our main result, we get the following
statement for the problem (P∗ ) considered in [5].
Corollary 2: Let y = Ax + e with e 2 ≤ ε and let Ψ ∈
Cn×p be a full-rank matrix. Let k be a nonnegative integer
such that

i.e., σk (x)

Proof: Since both x∗ and x are feasible (we recall that
y = Ax + e with e 2 ≤ ε), we have the following

recovery guarantees the restricted isometry constants are,
in general, hard to compute. Moreover, the results in [5]
hinge on the assumption that Ψ forms a Parseval frame, i.e.,
ΨH Ψ = Id ; a corresponding extension to general Ψ was
provided in [14]. We ﬁnally note that it does not seem possible
to infer the coherence-based threshold (5) from the D-RIP
recovery guarantees in [5], [14].

We analyze an image-separation problem where we remove
a ﬁngerprint from a cartoon image. We corrupt the 512 × 512
greyscale cartoon image depicted in Fig. 1(a) by adding a
ﬁngerprint2 and i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian noise.
Cartoon images are constant apart from (a small number of)
discontinuities and are thus sparse under the ﬁnite difference
operator ∆ deﬁned in [15]. Fingerprints are sparse under the
application of a wave atom transform, W, such as the redundancy 2 transform available in the WaveAtom toolbox3 [16].
It is therefore sensible to perform separation by solving the
problem (PA) with Ψ1 = ∆, Ψ2 = W, and A = Id . For our
simulation, we use a regularized version of ∆ and we employ
the TFOCS solver4 from [17].
Fig. 1(c) shows the corresponding recovered image. We can
see that the restoration procedure gives visually satisfactory
results.

Since Q is the set of indices of the k largest (in magnitude)

we have ΨS h 1 ≤ ΨQ h 1 and ΨQc h 1 ≤ ΨS c h 1 ,

results developed earlier in [5], [6] and summarized, for
completeness, next.

2) Bounding the recovery error: We want to bound h 2

to be full-rank), it follows from the Rayleigh-Ritz theorem [18,
Th. 4.2.2] that

If h = 0, then ΨQ h 2 = 0, since Ψ is assumed to

A recovery condition for (P) could now be obtained by
simply inserting A and Ψ in (20), (21) above into (5).
In certain cases, we can, however, get a better (i.e., less

in [7] and detailed next.

Using Lemma 4 and (15) and following the same steps as

Since µ1 ≤ µ2 , by assumption, the inequality in (30)

is tighter than the one in (29). We complete the proof by
combining the thresholds in (19) and (29) to get (3).

where (25a) follows from the deﬁnition of µm , (25b) results

from u 1 ≤ k u 2 , for k-sparse u, and (25c) is a consequence of the arithmetic-mean geometric-mean inequality.
Combining (23), (24), and (25d) gives

where g(k1 , k2 ) ωmin − f (k1 , k2 ) − µk.
Next, we bound g(k1 , k2 ) from below by a function of k =
k1 +k2 . This can be done, e.g., by looking for the minimum [7]

min

g(k1 , k − k1 )

g(k − k2 , k2 ).

or equivalently
g (k)
ˆ

k2 : 0≤k2 ≤k

To ﬁnd g (k) in (26) or in (27), we need to distinguish between
ˆ
two cases:
• Case 1: µ1 (k1 − 1) ≤ µ2 (k2 − 1)
In this case, we get
2
g(k − k2 , k2 ) = ωmin − µ2 (k2 − 1) − µm

k2 (k − k2 ) − µk.

A straightforward calculation reveals that the minimum of g
is achieved at
k2 =

If g (k) > 0, then we have
