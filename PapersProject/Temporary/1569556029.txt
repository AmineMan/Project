Abstract—Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation of energy-constrained wireless networks. In
particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely
wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn signiﬁcant
attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless
link over the ﬂat-fading channel subject to the time-varying cochannel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no
ﬁxed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via
WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended
signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a singleantenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest
energy at any given time due to the practical circuit limitation.
As a result, it is important to investigate when the receiver
should switch between the two modes of information decoding
(ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous
channel and interference conditions. In this paper, we derive the
optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various
tradeoffs between the minimum transmission outage probability
for ID and the maximum average harvested energy for EH,
which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called “outageenergy” region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state
information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate
the joint optimization of transmit power control and scheduling
for information and energy transfer with the receiver’s mode
switching. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal
design of emerging wireless communication systems powered by
opportunistic WEH.

“power splitting” (the receiver splits the received signal for
decoding information and harvesting energy separately) to enable wireless information transfer with simultaneous wireless
energy harvesting (WEH).
In this paper, we investigate further the time-switching
scheme in [3] for a point-to-point single-antenna ﬂat-fading
channel subject to the time-varying co-channel interference,
as shown in Fig. 1. It is assumed that the transmitter has a
ﬁxed power supply (e.g., battery), whereas the receiver has
no ﬁxed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy
via WEH from the received interference and/or signal sent
by the transmitter. We consider an opportunistic WEH at
the single-antenna receiver, i.e., the receiver can only decode
information or harvest energy at any given time, but not both.
As a result, the receiver needs to decide when to switch
between an information decoding (ID) mode and an energy
harvesting (EH) mode, based on the instantaneous channel
gain and interference power, which are assumed to be perfectly
known at the receiver. In this paper, we derive the optimal
mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various tradeoffs
between the minimum transmission outage probability for ID
and the maximum average harvested energy for EH, which are
characterized by the boundary of a so-called “outage-energy
(O-E)” region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state
information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we examine
the optimal design of transmit power control and scheduling
for information and energy transfer jointly with the receiver’s
mode switching, to achieve all the boundary outage-energy
pairs of the O-E region. It is worth noting that from a traditional point of view, interference in general jeopardizes the
wireless channel capacity unless it is sufﬁciently strong to be
decoded [4]. However, in our system of interest, interference is
utilized as a source for WEH. Hence, the fundamental role of
interference in emerging wireless networks with simultaneous
information and power transfer still remains unknown and is
thus worth further investigating.

INTRODUCTION

In conventional energy-constrained wireless networks such
as sensor networks, the lifetime of the network is an important
performance indicator since sensors are equipped with ﬁxed
energy supplies, e.g., battery, which are of limited operation
time. Therefore, energy harvesting has become an appealing
solution to prolong the lifetime of wireless networks. In
addition to other commonly used energy sources such as solar
and wind, ambient radio signals can be a viable new source for
energy harvesting, which has recently drawn a great deal of
interest (see, e.g., [1]-[3] and references therein). Most existing
works have studied the fundamental performance limits of
wireless systems with simultaneous information and energy
transfer under different setups, where the receiver is assumed
to be able to decode the information and harvest the energy
independently from the same received signal. However, this assumption relies on that the received signal used for harvesting
energy can be reused for decoding information, which may not
be realizable due to practical circuit limitations. Consequently,
in [3] the authors proposed two practical receiver designs,
namely “time switching” (the receiver switches between decoding information and harvesting energy dynamically) and

As shown in Fig. 1, this paper considers a wireless point-topoint link consisting of one pair of single-antenna transmitter

Tx for each fading state ν. In this case, Tx is able to schedule
transmission for information and energy transfer to Rx based
on the instantaneous CSI. As shown in Fig. 2(b), Tx allocates
time slot 1 for energy transfer, time slot 3 for information
transfer, and transmits no signals in time slot 2. Accordingly,
Rx will be in EH mode (i.e., π(ν) = 0) to harvest the energy
from the received signal (including the interference) in time
slot 1, and solely from the received interference in time slot
2, and in ID mode (i.e., π(ν) = 1) to decode the information
in time slot 3. In addition to transmission scheduling, Tx
can implement power control based on the CSI to further
improve the information/energy transmission efﬁciency. Let
p(ν) denote the transmit power of Tx at fading state ν. In
this paper, we consider two types of power constraints on
p(ν), namely average power constraint (APC) and peak power
constraint (PPC) [5]. The APC limits the average transmit
power of Tx over all the fading states, i.e., Eν [p(ν)] ≤ Pavg ,
where Eν [·] denotes the expectation over ν. In contrast, the
PPC constrains the instantaneous transmit power of Tx at each
of the fading states, i.e., p(ν) ≤ Ppeak , ∀ν. Without loss of
generality, we assume Pavg ≤ Ppeak . For convenience, we
deﬁne the set of feasible power allocation as
{

p(ν) : Eν [p(ν)] ≤ Pavg , p(ν) ≤ Ppeak , ∀ν .

(Tx) and receiver (Rx) over a ﬂat-fading channel. It is assumed
that there is an aggregate interference at Rx, which is within
the same bandwidth as the transmitted signal from Tx, and
changes over time. For convenience, we assume that the
channel from Tx to Rx follows a block-fading model [5]
and the coherence time for the time-varying interference is
the same as the channel coherence time. The channel power
gain and the interference power at Rx at one particular fading
state are denoted by h(ν) and I(ν), respectively, where ν
denotes the joint fading state. It is assumed that h(ν) and
I(ν) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables (RVs) each having a continuous probability density
function (PDF). At any fading state ν, h(ν) and I(ν) are
assumed to be perfectly known at Rx. In addition, the additive
noise at Rx is assumed to be a circularly symmetric complex
Gaussian (CSCG) RV with zero mean and variance σ 2 .
We consider a block-based transmission at Tx and the timeswitching scheme at Rx for decoding information or harvesting
energy at each fading state. Next, we elaborate the encoding
and decoding strategies for our system of interest in the
following two cases: Case I: h(ν) and I(ν) are unknown at
Tx for all the fading states of ν, referred to as CSI Unknown
at Tx; and Case II: h(ν) and I(ν) are perfectly known at Tx
at each fading state ν, referred to as CSI Known at Tx (CSIT).
First, consider the case of CSI Unknown at Tx, as shown in
Fig. 2(a). In this case, Tx transmits information continuously
with constant power P for all the fading states due to the lack
of CSI. At each fading state ν, Rx decides whether to decode
the information or harvest the energy from the received signal
based on h(ν) and I(ν). For example, as shown in Fig. 2(a),
time slots 1 and 3 are allocated to EH mode at Rx, while time
slot 2 is allocated to ID mode. For convenience, we deﬁne an
indicator function to denote the receiver’s mode switching at
any given ν as follows:
{
1, ID mode is active
π(ν) =
(1)
0, EH mode is active.

III. O UTAGE -E NERGY T RADEOFF
We consider two performance measures at Rx, which are
the outage probability for wireless information transfer and
the average harvested energy for WEH. Assuming that the
interference is treated as additive Gaussian noise at Rx and the
transmitted signal is Gaussian distributed, the instantaneous
mutual information (IMI) for the Tx-Rx link at fading state ν
is expressed as [5]
(
)
h(ν)p(ν)
r(ν) = π(ν) log 1 +
.
(3)
I(ν) + σ 2
Note that r(ν) = 0 if Rx switches to EH mode (i.e., π(ν) = 0).
Thus, considering a delay-limited transmission with constant
rate r0 , the outage probability at Rx can be expressed as [5]
ε = P r {r(ν) < r0 } ,

(4)

where P r{·} denotes the probability.
On the other hand, the amount of energy (normalized to the
transmission block duration) that can be harvested at Rx at
fading state ν is assumed to be
(
)(
)
Q(ν) = α 1 − π(ν) h(ν)p(ν) + I(ν) + σ 2 ,
(5)
where α is a constant that accounts for the loss in the energy
transducer for converting the harvested energy to electrical
energy to be stored; for convenience, it is assumed that α = 1
in this paper. Moreover, since the background thermal noise
has constant power σ 2 for all the fading states, we may ignore
it in (5). Thus, in the rest of this paper, we assume Q(ν) :=
(
)(
)
1 − π(ν) h(ν)p(ν) + I(ν) . The average energy that can be
harvested at Rx is then given by

Next, we consider the case of CSI Known at Tx, i.e., the
channel gain h(ν) and interference power I(ν) are known at

Qavg = Eν [Q(ν)].

where fν (h, I) denotes the joint PDF. Note that Qmin is the
minimum average harvested energy at Rx when the maximum
non-outage probability (or minimum outage probability) is
achieved. Moreover, Qmax is obtained as

when π(ν) = 0, ∀ν, i.e., EH mode is active all the time
at Rx and thus the resulted non-outage probability is 0
(corresponding to the maximum outage probability equal to
1). Similarly, Qmin , δmax , and Qmax can be deﬁned for the
case with CSIT; due to the space limitation, we omit their
expressions.
Since the optimal tradeoffs between the non-outage probability and average harvested energy are characterized by the
boundary of the O-E region, it is important to characterize all
the boundary (δ, Qavg ) pairs in each case of with or without
CSIT. From Fig. 3, it is easy to observe that if Qavg < Qmin ,
the non-outage probability δmax can still be achieved for both
cases. Thus, the remaining boundary of the O-E region yet to
be characterized is over the intervals Qmin ≤ Qavg ≤ Qmax
and 0 ≤ δ ≤ δmax .
For the convenience of analysis, we introduce the following
indicator function for the event of non-outage transmission at
fading state ν:

It is easy to see that there exist non-trivial tradeoffs in
assigning the receiver mode π(ν) and/or transmit power
p(ν) (in the case of CSI known at Tx) to balance between
minimizing the outage probability for information transfer
and maximizing the average harvested energy for WEH. To
characterize such tradeoffs, we introduce a so-called OutageEnergy (O-E) region (deﬁned below) that consists of all the
achievable non-outage probability (deﬁned as δ = 1 − ε with
outage probability ε given in (4)) and average harvested energy
pairs for a given set of power constraints. In the case without
(w/o) CSIT, the corresponding O-E region is deﬁned as
{

(δ, Qavg ) : δ ≤ P r {r(ν) ≥ r0 } ,

Fig. 3 shows an example of the O-E region without or with

σ 2 = 0.5, r0 = 0.3, h(ν) and I(ν) are independent exponentially distributed RVs with mean 1 and 3, respectively. It is
observed that CSIT helps improving the achievable outageenergy tradeoffs. In Fig. 3, there are two boundary points
shown for each O-E region denoted by (δmax , Qmin ) and
(0, Qmax ), respectively. For example, in the case without
CSIT, Qmin and δmax are obtained as

¯
Problems (P1) and (P2) for all Qmin ≤ Q ≤ Qmax , we are
able to characterize the entire boundary of the O-E region
deﬁned in (7) or (8) (without or with CSIT).
Problems (P1) and (P2) are both non-convex optimization
problems. However, it can be veriﬁed that both of them satisfy
the “time-sharing” condition given in [6]. To show this for
¯
Problem (P1), let Φ(Q) denote the optimal problem value
¯
given the harvested energy constraint Q, and {π a (ν)} and
b
{π (ν)} denote the optimal solutions given the harvested
¯

energy constraints Qa and Qb , respectively. We need to prove
that for any 0 ≤ θ ≤ 1, there always exists at least one solution

¯
here. In fact, the “time-sharing” condition implies that Φ(Q)

is concave in Q,
for Problem (P1) according to the convex analysis in [7].
Similarly, we can show that the duality gap of Problem (P2)
is zero. Thereby, in the following two sections, we will utilize
the Lagrange duality method to solve Problems (P1) and (P2),
respectively.

We ﬁrst study Problem (P1) for the CSIT-unknown case to
derive the optimal rule at Rx to switch between EH and ID
modes. The Lagrangian of Problem (P1) is formulated as

the optimal dual solution to Problem (P1) corresponding to the

fading states in the region H = {(h, I) : log 1+ I+σ2 ≥ r0 }
to EH mode. The problem of interest is to decide which portion
of H should be allocated to EH mode. It is observed from Fig.
4 that the optimal solution to this problem is to allocate all
1
the (h, I) pairs satisfying 1 < λ∗ hP + λ∗ I or hP + I > λ∗ in
H to EH mode, i.e., fading states with sufﬁciently large signal
plus interference total power at Rx should be allocated to EH
mode. Furthermore, note that λ∗ increases with the increasing
¯
of Q. Thus, one boundary line λ∗ hP + λ∗ I = 1 that separates
the optimal ID and EH regions in Fig. 4 is shifted down as λ∗
increases, and as a result DID (λ∗ ) shrinks. It can be shown

that if λ∗ ≥ (er0 −1)σ2 , then DID (λ∗ ) = Ø, which corresponds
to the point (0, Qmax ) in Fig. 3.

WITH CSIT
In this section, we address the case of CSI known at Tx by
jointly optimizing energy/information scheduling and power
control at Tx, as well as EH/ID mode switching at Rx, as
formulated in Problem (P2). For Problem (P2), let λ and
β denote the dual variables corresponding to the average
harvested energy constraint and average power constraint,
respectively. Similarly as for Problem (P1), Problem (P2) can
be decoupled into parallel subproblems each for one particular
fading state and expressed as (by ignoring the fading index ν)

With a given λ, Problem (15) can be efﬁciently solved by
solving Problem (16) for different fading states. Problem (P1)
is then solved by iteratively solving Problem (15) with ﬁxed
λ, and updating λ via a simple bisection method until the
harvested energy constraint is met with equality [8].
Next, we examine the optimal solution π ∗ to Problem (P1)
to gain more insights to the optimal receiver mode switching
in the case without CSIT. With a given harvested energy con¯
straint Q, we deﬁne the region on the (h, I) plane consisting of
all the point (h, I)’s for which the optimal solution to Problem
(P1) is π ∗ = 1 (versus π ∗ = 0) as the optimal ID region
(versus the optimal EH region). Furthermore, let λ∗ denote

Fig. 4 for the case without CSIT, it is observed from Fig. 5 that
in the case with CSIT, the transmitter is able to jointly design
information/energy scheduling and power control to optimally
match the receiver ID/EH mode switching. The time-varying
channel and interference are thus better exploited than the
CSIT-unknown case, but at a cost of higher implementation
complexity.

Then, given a pair of λ and β, the optimal solution to
Problem (22) for fading state ν can be expressed as

VI. C ONCLUSION
This paper studies an emerging interesting application in
wireless communication where the receiver opportunistically
harvests the energy from the received signals in addition to
decoding their carried information. Under a point-to-point
ﬂat-fading channel setup with the time-varying interference,
we derive the optimal ID/EH mode switching at the receiver to optimize the information-outage-probability versus
average-harvested-energy tradeoffs. When the CSI is known
at the transmitter, joint optimization of transmitter information/energy scheduling and power control with receiver ID/EH
mode switching is investigated.

Next, to ﬁnd the optimal dual variables λ∗ and β ∗ for Problem
(P2), sub-gradient based methods such as the ellipsoid method
[8] can be applied. It can be shown that the sub-gradient for
¯
updating (λ, β) is [Eν [Q∗ (ν)] − Q, Pavg − Eν [p∗ (ν)]], where
Q∗ (ν) and p∗ (ν) denote the harvested energy and transmit
power at fading state ν after solving Problem (22) for a given
pair of λ and β. Hence, Problem (P2) is solved.
In general, there are three possible transmission modes at
Tx for the case with CSIT (cf. Fig. 2(b)): “information transfer
mode” with channel inversion power control, “energy transfer
mode” with peak transmit power, “silent mode” with no
transmissions, while the ﬁrst transmission mode corresponds to
the ID mode at Rx and the remaining two transmission modes
correspond to the EH mode at Rx. Similarly as in Section
IV, given a pair of optimal dual solutions to Problem (P2) λ∗
¯
and β ∗ associated with a pair of Q and Pavg , we can deﬁne
