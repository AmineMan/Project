delivered for each client before the deadline as an analytical
metric for evaluating both throughput and QoS for delayconstrained ﬂows. So, the total timely throughput (T3 ) is the
summation of timely throughputs of all the M clients; and our
objective is then to ﬁnd the maximum achievable T3 , denoted
by CT3 , over all possible scheduling policies.
We face a complicated combinatorial optimization problem
to ﬁnd CT3 , as there are exponential (in M ) different ways of
assigning packets to the AP’s for transmission. To overcome
this challenge, we propose a deterministic relaxation of the
problem, which is based on converting the problem to a
network with deterministic delays for each link. Our main
contribution in this paper is two-fold. First, we show that the
value of the solution to the relaxed problem, denoted by Cdet ,
is very close to CT3 . Therefore, instead of solving the main
problem, one can solve the relaxed problem to approximate
CT3 . Moreover, the solution to the relaxed problem proposes a
scheduling policy for the main problem which achieves a value
close to CT3 . Second, we show that the relaxed problem, which
is a packing problem, can also be approximated in polynomial
time using a simple LP rounding method.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes our network model, and explains the problem formulation. Section III describes and formulates the relaxation
of the problem, and states the main results. Finally, Section IV
and Section V provide the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem
2, respectively.
Related Work: Although there are classical results [5], [6]
on scheduling clients over time-varying channels and characterizing the average delay of service, in recent years there
has been increasing research on serving delay-sensitive trafﬁc
over wireless networks [7]-[12]. The most related work to
this paper is the work of Hou et. al [2], in which they have
proposed a framework for jointly addressing delay, delivery
ratio, and channel reliability. For a network with one AP
and N clients, the timely throughput region for the set of
N clients has been fully characterized in [2]; and the work
has been extended to variable-bit-rate applications in [3], and
time-varying channels and rate adaptation in [4]. Although
in [2]-[4] they provide tractable analytical results and lowcomplexity scheduling policies, the analyses are done for the
case of only one AP. This paper aims to extend the results to

Abstract—In this paper we consider the down link of a
heterogeneous wireless network with N Access Points (AP’s) and
M clients, where each client is connected to several out-of-band
AP’s, and requests delay-sensitive trafﬁc (e.g., real-time video).
We adopt the framework of Hou, Borkar, and Kumar, and study
the maximum total timely throughput of the network, denoted by
CT3 , which is the maximum average number of packets delivered
successfully before their deadline. We propose a deterministic
relaxation of the problem, which converts the problem to a
network with deterministic delays in each link. We show that
the additive gap between the capacity of the relaxed problem,
denoted by Cdet , and CT3 is bounded by 2 N (Cdet + N ), which
4
is asymptotically negligible compared to Cdet , when the network
is operating at high-throughput regime. Moreover, using LP
rounding methods we prove that the relaxed problem can be
approximated in polynomial time with additive gap of N .

I NTRODUCTION

With the dramatic increase in the consumer demand for
video content on mobile devices in recent years [1], one of the
most pressing challenges is to ﬁnd effective ways to provide
high volume of top quality video trafﬁc to wireless users.
With the evolution of wireless networks towards heterogeneous architectures, including wireless relays and femtocells,
and growing number of smart devices that can connect to several wireless technologies (e.g. 3G and WiFi), it is promising
that the opportunistic utilization of heterogeneous networks
(where available) can be one of the key solutions to help cope
with the phenomenal growth of video demand over wireless
networks. This motivates two fundamental questions: ﬁrst,
how much is the ultimate capacity gain from opportunistic
utilization of network heterogeneity for delay-sensitive trafﬁc?
And second, what are the optimal policies that exploit network
heterogeneity for delivery of time-sensitive trafﬁc?
In this paper, we study these questions in the downlink of a
heterogeneous wireless network with N Access Points (AP’s)
and M clients, where each AP is using a distinct frequency
band; and all AP’s are connected to each other through a
Backhaul Network (see Fig. 1(a)), with error free links.
We focus on real-time video streaming applications, such as
video-on-demand, video conferencing, and IPTV, that require
tight guarantees on the timely delivery of packets. As a result,
we focus on the notion of timely throughput, proposed in
[2], which measures the long-term average number of packets

1

policy, denoted by η, which makes the decisions causally based
on the entire past history of events. We denote the set of all
possible scheduling policies by S.
Deﬁnition 2: A greedy static scheduling policy, ηg-static , is a
scheduling policy in which each AP becomes responsible for
serving packets of a ﬁxed subset of clients for all intervals;
and the packets of clients assigned to an AP are served
according to their channel success probabilities. In particular,
a greedy static scheduling policy ηg-static is fully speciﬁed by
the vector Π = [I1 , I2 , . . . , IN ], where Ii ’s partition the
set {1, 2, . . . , M }, indicating how the packet of clients are
assigned to AP’s.
Consequently, when a greedy static scheduling policy is
applied and after the clients are assigned to the AP’s to get
service, during each interval each AP ﬁrst serves the client
with the highest channel success probability.
Let Nj (r, η) denote the number of successful deliveries for
Rxj using scheduling policy η during the rth interval. When
using η, the timely throughput of Rxj , denoted by Rj (η), is
deﬁned as

the case of having multiple AP’s, where there is an additional
challenge of how to split the packets among different AP’s.
II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
In this section we describe our network model and illustrate
the notion of timely throughput that was ﬁrst introduced in [2].
We consider the downlink of a wireless network with M
wireless clients Rx1 , . . . , RxM that have packet requests, and
N Access Points AP1 , . . . , APN . These AP’s have error-free
links to the Backhaul Network (see Fig.1). In addition, we
assume that time is slotted, and each AP may make one packet
transmission in each time-slot. Furthermore, the time-slots are
grouped into intervals of length τ .
Each AP is connected via unreliable wireless links to a
subset (possibly all) of the wireless clients. These unreliable
links are modeled as packet erasure channels that are i.i.d over
time, and have ﬁxed success probabilities for each transmission. In addition, channels are independent and do not have
interference with each other. The success probability of the
channel between APi and Rxj is denoted by pij ; and if there
is no link between APi and Rxj , then pij = 0.

According to Lemma 1 that we state later on, the optimization in (3) can be reduced to optimization over greedy static
scheduling policies. So, the optimization in (3) is equivalent
to ﬁnding the partition Π such that the corresponding ηg-static
M
maximizes
j=1 Rj (η) for η = ηg-static . However, this is
still quite challenging as the number of possible greedy static
scheduling policies is N M , which grows exponentially in M
for N > 1.

of N Access points (AP’s), M wireless clients, packet erasure channels from
AP’s to the clients, and the Backhaul network is illustrated in (a). Our time
model, in which time is slotted and time-slots are grouped to form intervals
of length τ , is shown in (b). In this ﬁgure τ = 4.

We assume that at the beginning of each interval each client
has request for a new packet. Right before the start of an
interval, each requested packet for that interval is assigned to
one of the AP’s to be transmitted to its corresponding client.
Furthermore, during a time-slot of an interval, each AP picks
one of the packets assigned to it to transmit. At the end of that
time-slot the AP will know if the packet has been successfully
delivered or not. If the packet is successfully delivered, the AP
removes that packet from its buffer and does not attempt to
transmit it any more. The packets that are not delivered by the
end of the interval are dropped from the AP’s.
Deﬁnition 1: The decisions on how to assign the requested
packets for an interval to the AP’s, and which packet to transmit on a time-slot by each AP are speciﬁed by a scheduling

D ETERMINISTIC R ELAXATION AND
S TATEMENT OF M AIN R ESULTS

To overcome the aforementioned challenge, we now describe our deterministic relaxation method that we use to
approximate the main problem (3) and state the main results.
A. Deterministic Relaxation
Suppose that packet of client j is the only packet assigned
to APi . The memory-less erasure channel with success probability pij can be viewed as a pipe with variable delay which
takes the packet from APi and gives it to Rxj according to

that variable delay. The probability distribution of the delay
is Geometric with parameter pij ; and without any deadline,
it takes p1 time-slots on average for packet of Rxj to be
ij
delivered when transmitted by APi .
To simplify the Main Problem, we propose to relax each
channel into a bit pipe with deterministic delay equal to the
inverse of its success probability. Therefore, for any packet
of Rxj , when assigned to APi , we associate a ﬁxed size of
1
pij to that packet. This means that each packet assigned to
an AP can be viewed as an object with a size, where the size
varies from one AP to another. On the other hand, we know
that each AP has τ time-slots during each interval to send
the packets that are assigned to it. Therefore, we can view
each AP as a bin of capacity τ . Therefore, our new problem
is a packing problem; i.e., we want to see over all different
assignments of objects to bins what the maximum number of
objects is that we can ﬁt in those N bins of capacity τ . We
denote this maximum by Cdet . More precisely, if we deﬁne
xij as the 0 − 1 variable which equals 1 if packet of client j is
assigned to APi , and 0 otherwise, then the Relaxed Problem
(RP) can be formulated as following.

Remark 3: According to Theorem 2 if we ﬁnd a basic
optimal solution to LP relaxation of (4), and then round down
the solution to get integral values, the result will deviate from
the optimal solution (Cdet ) by at most N . Note that N is
typically very small; and therefore, this algorithm performs
well in approximating the optimal solution to RP.
Remark 4: The Relaxed Problem in (4) is a special case
of the well-known Maximum Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP), for which there is a large body of literature.
Although GAP is APX-hard [16], there are several approximation algorithms for it, including [16]-[17]. The performance
guarantees in the literature are concerned with multiplicative
gap. However, our result in Theorem 2 suggests an additive
gap performance guarantee of N for the special case of
GAP presented in (4), which provides a tighter approximation
guarantee for our problem of interest for large Cdet .
Finally, we state the following corollary that bounds the gap
between CT3 and the T3 of the greedy static scheduling policy
that uses the assignment policy suggested by the solution to
relaxed problem.
Corollary 1: Suppose we choose a basic optimal solution to
the LP relaxation of (4), denoted by x∗tr , and round down the
solution to get integral values. Let Πapx denote the assignment
det

suggested by the resulting integral values; and let ηdet denote
the corresponding greedy static scheduling policy. For CT3 >

B. Main Results
We now state our main results. The ﬁrst theorem bounds
the gap between the solution to the Main Problem in (3) and
its deterministic relaxation in (4).
Theorem 1: Let CT3 denote the value of the solution to our
Main Problem in (3). Also, let Cdet denote the value of the
solution to our Relaxed Problem in (4). We have

receiver. (b) demonstrates the numerical results for the gap between CT3 and
Cdet for 30 different realizations of the network, where each realization is
constructed from a random and uniform location of clients. The ‘+’ indicates

Remark 1: As the number of AP’s, N , is typically small,
Theorem 1 implies that as CT3 → ∞, Cdet → 1. Hence, the
C T3
bounds in Theorem 1 suggest the asymptotic optimality of
solving RP instead of MP.
Remark 2: The bounds in Theorem 1 are worst-case
bounds, and via numerical analysis illustrated in Figure 2
we observe that the gap between CT3 and Cdet is in most
cases much smaller, even for a limited number of clients.
Therefore, rather than solving the Main Problem, we can solve
the Relaxed Problem and still get a value as the solution which
is very close to the solution for the main problem.
The next theorem demonstrates that the relaxed problem can
be approximated efﬁciently.

the case where pl = pl+1 = . . . = pτ , although l remains

Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. Complete proof details as well as

Consider the solution x∗ to LR-CP with the same construction as described in Lemma 3. By Lemma 3, x∗ is a basic

Let LR-RP denote the linear relaxation of RP in (4), which
is obtained by relaxing the integrality constraints xij ∈ {0, 1}
to nonnegativity constraints xij ≥ 0. Note that ﬁnding a basic
optimal solution to a linear program is straightforward, and is
discussed in [20]. So, let x∗tr = [x∗tr ]N ×M denote a basic

Now, it is sufﬁcient to show that Z ≤ N in order to complete
the proof of Theorem 2. To do so, we convert RP to an instance
of Min-GAP, which is formulated as following, and then use
the result in [18], [19].

xij = 1 1 ≤ j ≤ M
i=1

xij ∈ {0, 1}

1 ≤ i ≤ N, 1 ≤ j ≤ M.

The conversion is done as following, and is similar to that of
Section 3.2 in [16]. Set sij = p1 if pij > 0, and sij = T + 1
ij
if pij = 0.; set b = τ ; set cij = 1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , N and
j = 1, 2, . . . , M ; add an additional bin of capacity τ to ensure
the existence of a feasible solution. For the (N + 1)st bin set
sN +1,j = 0 and cN +1,j = M for j = 1, 2, . . . , M .
Let LR-CP denote the linear relaxation of the converted
problem. The following lemma, connects basic optimal solutions of LR-RP and LR-CP. The proof of Lemma 3 is omitted
for brevity.
Lemma 3: Suppose that x∗tr = [x∗tr ]N ×M is a basic
ij
solution to LR-RP. Further, consider x∗ = [x∗ ](N +1)×M ,
ij
where
1) ∀i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N } and ∀j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M } x∗ = x∗tr .

2) ∀j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M } x∗ +1,j = 1 − i=1 x∗tr .

Then, x∗ is a basic solution to LR-CP.
