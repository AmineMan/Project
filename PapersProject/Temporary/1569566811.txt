The three-user cognitive interference channel analyzed in this
work consists of one primary and two secondary opportunistic
cognitive radios. We assume a cumulative message cognition
structure introduced in [5] whereby user 2 (the ﬁrst cognitive
user) knows the message of user 1 (the primary user), and
user 3 (the second cognitive user) knows the messages of both
user 1 and user 2. We term this channel the three-user cognitive
interference channel with cumulative message sharing (3-user
CIFC with CMS).
The cumulative message cognition model is inspired by
the concept of overlaying, or layering, cognitive networks.
In particular, we consider multiple types of devices sharing
the spectrum. The ﬁrst “layer” consists of the primary users.
Each additional cognitive layer transmits simultaneously with
the previous layers (overlay), and given the lower layers’
codebooks (and are oblivious to higher layer operation). This
may enable them to learn the lower layers’ messages and
use this to aid the lower layers’ transmission, or to combat
interference at their own receivers. In this setting, the threeuser cumulative message sharing model where messages are
known non-causally, forms an outer bound for the more
realistic causal obtaining of messages possible in a network
with layered codebook knowledge.
For this model, we are interested in the impact of this
cumulative message knowledge on the sum-rate, and how
it improves the two-user cognitive model. We obtain the
sum-rate capacity of the linear deterministic channel that
approximates the Gaussian noise channel at high SNR [6],
and it is seen to signiﬁcantly increase that of the two-user
model, suggesting that, as the number of users increases, this
sum-capacity tends to that of the multiple-input multiple-out
broadcast channel.
Past Work. The literature on the fundamental performance
of multi-user cognitive interference channels is limited, in
parts due to the fact that the two-user counterpart is not yet
fully understood [3], [4]. In [5], [7]–[10] different threeuser cognitive channels are considered; for sake of space we
note that the models differ from the one considered here
either in the number of transmitter/receivers, or in the message
sharing / cognition structure in all but [5], [7]. In [5], [7]
two types of three-user cognitive interference channels with
3 transmitters, 3 receivers, and 3 messages are proposed: that
with “cumulative message sharing” (as considered here) and
that with “primary message sharing” where the message of

Abstract—Inspired by cognitive networks, we consider the
linear deterministic three-user cognitive interference channel
with one primary and two secondary/cognitive transmitters
which approximates the Gaussian channel at high SNR. Outer
bounds on the sum-rate are derived and matching transmission
schemes are provided in all interference regimes, thereby completely characterizing the sum-capacity. Signiﬁcant increase in
the sum-capacity is demonstrated when comparing the threeuser cognitive channel to the classical (non-cognitive) threeuser interference channel and to the two-user cognitive channel.
The paper discusses extensions to an arbitrary number of
users, the relationship between the cognitive channel and the
(fully cooperative) broadcast channel, and observations on the
behavior of the cognitive transmitters in the different interference
scenarios.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The increase in number of wireless services over the past
decade along with the shortage of frequency spectrum has
spurred the wireless communication community to explore
the possibility of several users/devices coexisting in the same
frequency band. With the goal of enhancing spectral efﬁciency
and allowing sophisticated secondary users to exploit the same
frequency band without causing signiﬁcant degradation of
performance of licensed/primary users, the cognitive radio
technology has emerged. In cognitive networks, smart devices
are capable of sensing and adapting to their environment and
therefore better utilize the available spectrum. Cognitive radios
are able to interweave with primary signals (i.e., search for
available unused spectrum), underlay (i.e., in which they can
operate simultaneously with primary users as long as the
interference caused is within an acceptable level) or overlay
(i.e., in which cognitive radios exploit message knowledge
through encoding schemes to mitigate interference) [1].
The cognitive radio channel, ﬁrst introduced in [2], consists
of two source-destination pairs in which one of the transmitters
called the secondary transmitter has non-causal a priori knowledge of the message of the other transmitter known as the
primary transmitter. For the state-of-the-art on the two-user
cognitive channel we refer the reader to [3], [4]. In particular,
the capacity of the deterministic two-user cognitive channel is
known [3] and that the capacity of the Gaussian noise channel
is known exactly for most channel parameters, and to within
one bit otherwise [4].
In this paper we are interested in the extension of the twouser cognitive interference channel to the case of three users.

the different bounds as long as the conditional marginal
distributions PYi |X1 ,X2 ,X3 are preserved for i ∈ [1 : 3].

we derive a novel and general three-user outer bound
region that reduces to the outer bound of [3] for the twouser case,
we evaluate the sum-rate outer bound for the Linear Deterministic approximation of the Gaussian noise Channel
(LDC) at high SNR and provide matching achievable
schemes that include elements of bit-cancellation and bitself cleaning [11],
we discuss an extension to an arbitrary number of users
and relations with the generalized degrees of freedom of
the Gaussian noise channel at ﬁnite SNR.

Note that by setting X3 = Y3 = ∅ in (1), the region in Th. 1
reduces to the outer bound of [3]. As we shall explain later,
Th. 1 can be extended to a general memoryless K-user CIFC
with CMS.
Proof: The proof is provided in the Appendix.
IV. T HE SUM - CAPACITY OF THE L INEAR D ETERMINISTIC
3- USER CIFC WITH CMS
A. Channel Model
The Linear Deterministic approximation of the Gaussian
noise Channel (LDC) at high SNR was ﬁrst introduced in [12],
and allows one to focus on the signal interactions rather than
on the additive noise. The proposed framework has proven to
be powerful in understanding communication over interference
networks, and the insights gained for the LDC have often been
translated into capacity results to within constant gaps for any
ﬁnite SNR [4], [13], [14]. In light of these success stories we
also start our investigation from the LDC.
In the LDC model, the input-output relationship is given by,
for u ∈ [1 : 3]

Paper Organization. The paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the channel model. Section III presents our
novel outer bound region. Section IV considers the LDC and
provides sum-rate optimal achievable schemes. In Section V
comparisons between the sum-capacity of different cognitive
models are presented. Section VI concludes the paper.
II. C HANNEL M ODEL
The 3-user CIFC with CMS channel (a general example is
shown in Fig. 1) consists of

Yu =

• Channel inputs X1 , X2 , X3 in alphabets X1 , X2 , and X3 ,
• Channel outputs Y1 , Y2 , Y3 in alphabets Y1 , Y2 , and Y3 ,
• A memoryless channel described by PY1 ,Y2 ,Y3 |X1 ,X2 ,X3 ,
• Encoder i, i ∈ [1 : 3], has message Wi , uniformly distributed
over [1 : 2N Ri ] and independent of everything else, to be
decoded at receiver i,
• Encoder 2 knows message W1 non-causally,
• Encoder 3 knows messages (W1 , W2 ) non-causally,

• Encoding functions fi : Xi := fi (W1 , . . . , Wi ), i ∈ [1 : 3],
• Decoding functions gi : Wi := gi (Y1N ), i ∈ [1 : 3].

where S is the binary shift matrix of dimension m, all inputs
and outputs are binary column vectors of dimension m, and
the summation is bit-wise over the binary ﬁeld.
B. Sum-rate Outer Bound
For sake of space we only evaluate the sum-rate capacity,
which we will show to be achievable. Since the channel is
deterministic, the sum-rate upper bound in (1e) reduces to the
following maximization over the set of joint input distributions
PX1 ,X2 ,X3 :

(N )

The probability of error is deﬁned as Pe
:=
maxi∈[1:3] P[Wi = Wi ]. A rate triple (R1 , R2 , R2 ) is achiev(N )
able if there exists a code such the probability of error Pe →
0 as N → ∞. The capacity region is the closure of the set of
achievable rates.

the sum-rate is upper bounded by
RΣ ≤ max{n11 , n12 , n13 ) + f (n22 , n23 |n12 , n13 )

+ H(Sm−n33 X3 |Sm−n13 X3 , Sm−n23 X3 )

Is this case, the condition in (6) suggests that the intended
signal at receiver 3 is sufﬁciently strong to be able to support
where the function f is deﬁned as
a non-zero R3 . The form of the sum-rate also suggests that
f (c, d|a, b) := H(Sm−c X2 + Sm−d X3 |Sm−a X2 + Sm−b X3 ), a plausible strategy is to use the optimal strategy for Case1
computed for iid Bernoulli(1/2) inputs as in [15, eq.(5)], as: and “sneak in” extra bits for user 3 in such a way that they
appear below the noise level at the other receivers. We next
f (c, d|a, b)
show that this is optimal.
Split the signal of user 3 in two parts
max{c + b, a + d} − max{a, b} if c − d = a − b,
:=
max{a, b, c, d} − max{a, b} if c − d = a − b.
X3 := X3a + X3b
Depending on the channel gains, different interference scenarios are identiﬁed for RΣ . In the next section we provide where X3a is intended to mimic the scheme for Case1 (i.e.,
transmission schemes that are capable of achieving the sum- as if user 2 had input [X2 , X3a ]) and X3b is
rate upper bound we just evaluated.

C. Achievable Scheme
Our main result is the achievability of the proposed sum-rate
upper bound.

for some iid Bernoulli(1/2) input V3 . Note that the shift caused
by S max{n13 ,n23 } keeps V3 below noise level at Y1 and Y2 . We
implement the optimal strategy for Case1 with [X1 , X2 , X3a ],
the remaining bits then achieve the sum-rate in (7).

Theorem 2. The upper bound for the LDC 3-user CIFC with
CMS given by (3) is achievable.

D. Examples

Proof: The proof distinguishes two cases. Case1: If
n33 ≤ max{n13 , n23 }

In order to present some concrete examples of the achievability scheme, we consider here the symmetric LDC deﬁned
as nii = nS > 0 for i ∈ [1 : 3] and nij = nS α for some
α ≥ 0 for j = i. We also deﬁne,

(4)

the sum-rate becomes
RΣ ≤ max{n11 , n12 , n13 ) + f (n22 , n23 |n12 , n13 ).

(5)

di := Ri /nS , i ∈ [1 : K],

The condition in (4) corresponds to the case
H(Y3 |X1 , Y1 , X2 , Y2 ) = 0, i.e., conditioned on (X1 , X2 ) the
signal received at the “most cognitive” receiver is a degraded
version of the signal received at the other two receivers. For
this condition, the useful signal at receiver 3 is weak with
respect to the interfering signals. One might thus suspect that
R3 = 0 is optimal; we show that this is the case.
Since the third user has a weak channel, we set its rate
to zero and we therefore convert the three-user channel into
a deterministic two-user cognitive channel where user 1 is
the primary user and the cognitive user has a vector input
given by [X2 , X3 ] to its output Y2 . The capacity of a general
deterministic two-user cognitive channel is [3]

dΣ (α; K) :=

With these deﬁnitions, the sum-capacity can be expressed as
dΣ (α; 3) = max{2 + [1 − α]+ , 2α}.

R2 ≤ H(Y2 |X1 ),

for some input distribution PX1 ,[X2 ,X3 ] . The sum-rate achievable with this scheme is
max

(8)

Figs. 2 and 3 show examples of the achievable strategy for
Case1, corresponding to α > 1, and Case2, corresponding to
α < 1, respectively. We show the different linear combinations
of the shifted transmit signals X1 , X2 , X3 received at the
three receivers. In both ﬁgures, notice the important role of
cognition: in Fig. 3 the third transmitter (cognitive of all 3
messages) sends either a combination of the messages of users
1 and 2, thereby simultaneously “cleaning” the interference at
the respective receivers, while at the same time pre-canceling
the interference seen at his own receiver to obtain the green
bits. In Fig. 2 the two cognitive transmitters aid in transmitting
the ﬁrst two messages (a form of broadcast strategy).
Additional interesting observations regarding the role of
cognition for the 3-user CIFC with CMS may be made. The
second cognitive transmitter, cognizant of the its message and
the message of primary transmitter, is only required to use
its cognitive abilities in the strong interference scenarios. The

Therefore, for K-user CIFC with CMS the sum-rate normalized by the number of users is a function of K. The sumcapacity result for the symmetric LDC can in fact be evaluated

This has the interesting interpretation that the cumulative
cognition in the symmetric case looses α/K with respect
(BC)
dΣ (α; K)/K. In other words, as the number of cognitive
users increases the network approaches the sum-rate performance of a fully coordinated BC.
Fig. 4 shows the sum-rate normalized by the number of
users for different channel models. We note the increase in
performance in all interference regimes when compared to that
of 2-user CIFC with CMS, the classical K-user interference
channel but a loss with respect to the K-user BC.

third cognitive transmitter, cognizant of all messages, applies
bit cancellation and bit self cleaning in weak interference
regimes to cancel interference at their receivers, allowing the
other two transmitters to attain their maximal rates.
V. C OMPARISON OF SUM - CAPACITY BETWEEN CIFC AND
OTHER KNOWN CHANNELS

We compare the sum-rate of different channel models with
different number of users and different levels of cognition. Our
base line for comparison is the K-user interference channel
without any cognition; for this model we have [16]

In this paper we studied the 3-user cognitive interference
channel with cumulative message sharing. We derived an
outer-bound for the capacity region of a general memoryless channel. We then showed that the sum-rate evaluated
for the linear deterministic channel model is achievable for
three users, thereby obtaining the sum-capacity. Comparisons
between the 3-user channel and other channel models with
different cognition models highlight the beneﬁts of cognition,
and under what conditions they are most prominent. Our upper
bound, evaluated for K users rather than 3, suggests that as
the number of users increases the the sum-rate approaches
the sum-rate performance of a fully coordinated broadcast
channel. Whether this is achievable is the subject of ongoing
work, as is the translation of the insights gained from the
deterministic channel to the Gaussian noise channel.

At the other end of the spectrum we have the case where all

equivalent to a MIMO BC with K transmit antennas and K
