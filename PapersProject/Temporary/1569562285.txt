featuring some odd lattices outperforming their even counter
parts. It is natural to wonder whether other classes of lattices
would have a better secrecy gain. The contribution of this
paper is to initiate the study of the secrecy gain of other
modular lattices. Since the secrecy gain depends on the theta
series of the lattice considered, it makes sense to start with
even 2- and 3-modular lattices, whose theta series have a
decomposition formula similar to that of even unimodular
lattices. Our results show that 2- and 3-modular lattices indeed
achieve a secrecy gain larger than that of unimodular lattices
in all the dimensions treated so far, but for n = 22.

Abstract—Lattice coding over a Gaussian wiretap channel is
considered with respect to a lattice invariant called the secrecy
gain, which was introduced in [1] to characterize the confusion
that a chosen lattice can cause at the eavesdropper: the higher
the secrecy gain of the lattice, the more confusion. In this paper,
secrecy gains of several 2- and 3-modular lattices are computed.
Most are shown to have a secrecy gain larger than the best
unimodular lattices can achieve.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The wiretap channel was introduced by Wyner [2] as a
discrete memoryless broadcast channel where the sender Alice
transmits conﬁdential messages to a legitimate receiver Bob,
in the presence of an eavesdropper Eve. Both reliable and
conﬁdential communication between Alice and Bob should be
ensured at the same time, by exploiting the physical difference
between the channel to Bob and that to Eve via coding.
A survey on this topic is available in [3]. Many results of
information theoretical nature are available for various classes
of channels capturing the trade-off between reliability and
secrecy and aiming at determining the highest information rate
that can be achieved with perfect secrecy, the so-called secrecy
capacity. Coding results on constructing concrete codes that
can be implemented in a speciﬁc channel are much fewer
(see e.g. [4], [5] for examples of wiretap codes dealing with
channels with erasures).
In this paper, we discuss Gaussian wiretap channels, whose
secrecy capacity was established in [6]. Examples of existing
Gaussian wiretap codes were designed for binary inputs, as
in [7]. A different approach was adopted in [1], where lattice
codes were proposed, using as design criterion a new lattice
invariant called secrecy gain, which was shown to characterize
the confusion at the eavesdropper. This suggests the study
of the secrecy gain of lattices as a way to understand how
to design a good Gaussian wiretap code. So far, the special
class of unimodular lattices has been studied with particular
emphasis on even unimodular lattices [8], [9]: the secrecy gain
of extremal even unimodular lattices was computed, and the
asymptotic behavior of the average secrecy gain as a function
of the dimension n was investigated. The results show that
maximizing the secrecy gain is meaningful in small dimensions and inﬁnite secrecy gain (implying complete secrecy) is
possible as n grows to inﬁnity. Unimodular lattices in small
dimensions, both odd and even, were considered in [10], [11]
resulting in a complete classiﬁcation in dimension n, n ≤ 23,

II. P RELIMINARIES AND PREVIOUS RESULTS
A Gaussian wiretap channel is a broadcast Gaussian channel
modeled by
y = x + vb
(1)
z = x + ve ,
where x is the codeword sent by the transmitter (Alice), y
and z are the received signals at the legitimate receiver (Bob),
respectively at the eavesdropper (Eve), with corresponding
noise vectors vb and ve , whose components are i.i.d. Gaussian
2
2
distributed with zero mean and respective variance σb and σe .
2
2
It is assumed that σb < σe in order to have a positive
secrecy capacity [6]. We suppose that x ∈ Rn is a lattice
codeword, where by a lattice Λ we mean a discrete set of
points in Rn , which can be conveniently described by
Λ = {x = uM |u ∈ Zn },
where the generator matrix M stores as row vectors a basis
for the lattice.
Lattice encoding for the wiretap channel (1) is done via a
generic coset coding strategy [1]: let Λe ⊂ Λb be two nested
lattices, specially chosen such that the quotient group Λb /Λe
is of size 2k . A k-bit message is then mapped to a coset in
Λb /Λe , after which a vector is randomly chosen from the coset
as the encoded word. The lattice Λe will be interpreted as
introducing confusion for Eve, while Λb as ensuring reliability
for Bob. A bound on Eve’s probability Pc,e of correct decoding
shows [1] that to minimize Pc,e is to minimize

where ||t||2 = t · t is the norm (squared length) of a lattice
point. Let H = {a + ib ∈ C|b > 0} denote the upper half
plane and set
q = eπiτ , τ ∈ H.

Deﬁnition 2.3: The Jacobi theta functions are deﬁned as
follows:

 ϑ2 (τ ) = Σn∈Z q (n+ 1 )2 ,

It can be easily recognized that (2) is in fact the theta
i
series of Λe at τ = 2πσ2 . Motivated by the above argument,
e
the confusion brought by the lattice Λe with respect to no
coding (namely, use the lattice Zn scaled to the same volume,
where the volume vol(Λ) of a lattice Λ is by deﬁnition the
determinant of its generator matrix) is measured as follows
[1]:
Deﬁnition 2.2: Let Λ be an n-dimensional lattice of volume
V . The secrecy function of Λ is given by
ΞΛ (τ ) =

The secrecy gain is then the maximal value of the secrecy
function with respect to τ and is denoted by χΛ .
The theta series of a lattice is in general difﬁcult to analyze
except for special classes of lattices. We will take a closer look
at one of them, the family of -modular lattices. The dual of
a lattice Λ of dimension n is deﬁned to be
Λ∗ = {x ∈ Rn : x · λ ∈ Z, λ ∈ Λ}.
Λ is said to be an integral lattice if Λ ⊂ Λ∗ . The norm of
any lattice point in an integral lattice Λ is always an integer.
If the norm is even for any lattice point, then Λ is called an
even lattice. Otherwise, it is called an odd lattice. The theta
series of an integral lattice has a neat representation. Since
the norms are all integers, we can combine the terms with the
same norm and write

III. S ECRECY GAIN OF 2- AND 3- MODULAR LATTICES

A lattice is said to be equivalent, or geometrically similar
to its dual, if it differs from its dual only by possibly a
rotation, reﬂection and change of scale. An integral lattice that
is equivalent to its dual is called a modular lattice. Or as it
was ﬁrst deﬁned by H.-G. Quebbemann [12], an n-dimensional
integral lattice Λ is modular if there exists a similarity σ of Rn
such that σ(Λ∗ ) = Λ. If σ multiplies norms by , Λ is said to
be -modular. In the particular case when the similarity factor
= 1, such lattices are unimodular lattices, corresponding to
the more familiar deﬁnition Λ = Λ∗ . It can be shown that if
Λ is an -modular lattice of dimension n, then
vol(Λ) =

and the Dedekind eta function are

The following lemma [12] will play a crucial role.
Lemma 2.5: The theta series of an even -modular lattice
of dimension n = 2k when
= 1, 2, 3 belongs to
a space of modular forms of weight k generated by the
functions Θλ 0 (τ )∆µ 1 (τ ) with integers λ, µ ≥ 0 satisfying
2k
2k
k0 λ + k1 µ = k, where for = 1, 2, 3, k0 = 4, 2, 1
24
respectively, k1 = 1+ , Θ2k0 (τ ) denote the theta series
of the modular lattices E8 , D4 and A2 , respectively, and
k
∆2k1 (τ ) = (η(τ )η( τ )) 1 .
Example 2.6: If = 1, corresponding to the unimodular
case, we know from Lemma 2.5 that k0 = 4, k1 = 24 =
2
12, Θ2k0 (τ ) = ΘE8 (τ ), ∆2k1 (τ ) = η 24 (τ ), from which we
deduce that if Λ is an even unimodular lattice of dimension
n = 2k then

Lattices that are equivalent to their duals were shown to have
i
a symmetry point, called weak secrecy gain, at τ =
2
vol(Λ) n
in their secrecy function [9]. It was conjectured in the same
paper that for these lattices, the weak secrecy gain is actually
the secrecy gain. This conjecture was recently proven by A.M. Ernvall-Hyt¨ nen [15] for a special class of lattices called
o
extremal even unimodular lattices and by F. Lin and F. Oggier
[11] for unimodular lattices in dimension n, 8 < n ≤ 23. In
this paper, we still use χΛ to denote the weak secrecy gain.
We will compute the weak secrecy gains of known even 2and 3-modular lattices, and claim that their secrecy gains are
larger than that of unimodular lattices in the same dimension,
since the secrecy gain is by deﬁnition the maximum of the
secrecy function.
In order to write the secrecy function, we need to have
the theta series of Zn scaled to the right volume. Recall the

We will need the following concepts and formulae from
analytic number theory for our discussion, for which we refer

Now we only need to know the coefﬁcients aµ in order to

the 2-modular lattice D4 (or rather its inverse). Fig. 1 gives a
plot of the secrecy function of D4 , where (i) we set y = −iτ
and restrict to real positive values of y, since by (2) we are
only interested in the values of ΘD4 (τ ) with τ = yi, y > 0
and (ii) y is plotted in decibels to transform the multiplicative
symmetry point into an additive symmetry point. We can see
clearly that the secrecy function has a symmetry point at y ≈

We start by explaining how the coefﬁcients aµ ’s in (9) are
computed. By substituting (10) and (11) into (9), we have a
formal sum with coefﬁcients represented by the aµ ’s. Then by
comparing this formal sum with (3), we obtain a number of
linear equations in the aµ ’s. When we have enough equations,
the aµ ’s can be recovered by solving a linear system. Now,
let us compute the weak secrecy gain of the 16-dimensional
2-modular Barnes-Wall lattice BW16 as an example.
Example 3.1: BW16 is an even lattice with minimum norm

and 3-modular lattices. Besides, it is likely that one can prove
the conjecture for these particular cases using the same proof
technique as in [11], however it would be nice to have a more
general proof. Also, the encoding/labeling of the proposed
wiretap codes, taking into account both channel parameters
and power constraint are being naturally elaborated.

Weak secrecy gains of the even 3-modular lattices in dimensions smaller than 24 in [16] are also shown in Table I.
C. 2- and 3-modular lattices v.s. unimodular lattices
Now that we have computed the weak secrecy gains of several 2- and 3-modular lattices, we want to compare them with
the best unimodular lattices in their respective dimensions.
Table II lists the secrecy gains of the best unimodular lattices
and the weak secrecy gains of the even 2- and 3-modular
lattices we have computed. We can see that all 2- and 3modular lattices outperform the unimodular lattices except for
the 22-dimensional 3-modular lattice A2 × A11 .
IV. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, we investigate the secrecy gain of even 2and 3-modular lattices. A formula similar to that for even
unimodular lattices [8], [9] is derived and weak secrecy gains
of even 2- and 3-modular lattices in dimensions smaller than
24 are computed. They are found to be larger than that of the
best unimodular lattices, classiﬁed in [11], with an exception
of that of the lattice A2 × A11 . One direction of future work
will be naturally to look at the performance of -modular
lattices,
> 3. Another direction would be to study the
asymptotic behavior of the weak secrecy gain of the even 2-
