any entanglement assistance. For a single sender single receiver unassisted classical-quantum channel, called cq-channel
henceforth, Winter [8] gave a sequential decoding strategy
that achieves rates up to the mutual information. Winter’s
decoding strategy used a sequence of POVMs. Recently,
Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone [9] improved Winter’s result
by constructing a decoding strategy for the cq-channel that
applies a sequence of orthogonal projections instead of a
sequence of POVMs. Giovannetti et al.’s decoder tries to
project the sent message alternately onto the typical subspace
of the average message and the typical subspace of the current
candidate message. This leaves us wondering if a simpler
sequential decoding strategy is possible, in particular, whether
just projecting the received state onto the typical subspace
of the current candidate message is good enough for decoding. Besides the two sequential decoding results mentioned
above, other decoders for the cq-channel [10], [11], [13] use
conceptually more complex strategies including in particular,
the pretty good measurement also known as the square-root
measurement [12]. Besides conceptual simplicity, a sequential
decoding strategy with orthogonal projections offers efﬁciency
advantages in some settings. For a start, such a strategy can
be implemented in work space polynomial in the number
of qubits of the received message. It is unknown whether a
sequential decoding strategy with POVMs can be implemented
in polynomial space; the naive method of implementing an
exponentially long sequence of POVMs uses an exponential
number of qubits. In practically important settings like optical
channels, a sequential decoder using projections onto conditionally typical subspaces seems much easier to implement
than a decoder using the pretty good measurement [5].
In this paper, we ﬁrst construct a sequential decoding
scheme for the cq-channel where the decoder just tries to
project the received state onto the typical subspace of the current candidate message. We show that even this simple scheme
can achieve rates up to the mutual information. We then
construct a sequential decoder making orthogonal projections
for the two sender single receiver multiple access channel with
classical input and quantum output, called ccq-MAC henceforth, achieving the standard inner bound for this channel.
For this, we have to replace the standard conditionally typical
projectors by a new kind of conditionally typical projector
approximating the intersection of two conditionally typical
subspaces. The existence of such suitable projectors follows
from a powerful geometric fact about how two subspaces

Abstract—We construct an encoding and decoding scheme
achieving the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound [1] for a two
sender two receiver interference channel with classical input
and quantum output. This automatically gives a similar inner
bound for sending classical information through an interference
channel with quantum inputs and outputs without entanglement
assistance. Our result matches the best known inner bound for the
interference channel in the classical setting. Achieving the ChongMotani-Garg inner bound, which is known to be equivalent to the
Han-Kobayashi inner bound [3], answers an open question raised
recently by Fawzi et al. [4]. Our encoding strategy is the standard
random encoding strategy. Our decoding strategy is a sequential
strategy where a receiver loops through all candidate messages
trying to project the received state onto a ‘typical’ subspace
for the candidate message under consideration, stopping if the
projection succeeds for a message, which is then declared as the
guess of the receiver for the sent message.
On the way to our main result, we show that random encoding
and sequential decoding strategies sufﬁce to achieve rates up
to the mutual information for a single sender single receiver
channel, and the standard inner bound for a two sender single
receiver multiple access channel, for channels with classical input
and quantum output. Besides conceptual simplicity, a sequential
decoding strategy is space efﬁcient, and may have additional
efﬁciency advantages in some settings. We prove our inner
bounds using two new technical tools — a non-commutative union
bound to analyse the decoding error probability, and a geometric
notion of approximate interesection of two conditionally typical
subspaces.

I. I NTRODUCTION
For many classical channels, one can construct a simple
sequential decoding strategy as follows: the receiver loops
through all candidate messages trying to check if the current
candidate message is jointly typical with the received string.
If yes, the receiver stops and declares the current candidate
message as its guess for the sent message. If no, the receiver
tries the next candidate message and so on. If all candidate
messages are exhausted, the receiver declares failure. Such
a simple sequential decoding strategy works for example for
the single sender single receiver channel as well as the many
sender single receiver multiple access channel.
For a quantum channel, one can ask if the sequential
decoding intuition from the classical world leads to a valid
decoding strategy. To simplify the setting, we shall restrict
ourselves to channels with classical input and quantum output.
Note that an encoding and decoding strategy for such a channel
immediately gives us, via standard arguments, an encoding
and decoding strategy for sending classical information over
channels with quantum input and quantum output without

interact. Our sequential decoding strategy for the ccq-MAC
is ‘jointly typical’ or ‘simultaneous’. Until very recently, the
only decoders known for the ccq-MAC were of the ‘successive cancellation’ variety (e.g. [7]). Simultaneous decoders
are crucial in proving many results in classical multiuser
information theory. The lack of simultaneous decoders in the
quantum setting is a major stumbling block in the development
of multiuser quantum information theory. Our simultaneous
decoder for the ccq-MAC should be an important ﬁrst step
towards the development of a powerful multiuser quantum
information theory. Another simultaneous decoder for the ccqMAC was discovered very recently by Fawzi et al. [4].
Finally, as the main application of our methods, we construct an encoding and decoding scheme achieving the ChongMotani-Garg [1] inner bound for a two sender two receiver
interference channel with classical input and quantum output, called ccqq-IC henceforth. The Chong-Motani-Garg inner
bound is known to be equivalent [2] to the Han-Kobayashi [3]
inner bound, which is the best known inner bound for the
interference channel in the classical setting. This answers an
open question raised recently by Fawzi et al. [4]. The ChongMotani-Garg and Han-Kobayashi inner bounds are not known
to be achievable by successive cancellation. Some previous
works [16], [17] have attempted to achieve these inner bounds
using rate splitting; however they suffer from the bug that
rate spitting according to the convenience of one receiver may
not be good for the other receiver. We prove the ChongMotani-Garg inner bound for the ccqq-IC by analysing, as
in the classical case, a special three sender single receiver
classical-quantum multiple access channel, called CMG-MAC
henceforth. We prove an inner bound for the CMG-MAC
using our techniques which turns out to be larger than Chong,
Motani and Garg’s classical inner bound for the same encoding
strategy! However, this improved inner bound does not enlarge
the Chong-Motani-Garg region for the interference channel.
Our encoding scheme is the same as that of Chong-MotaniGarg, and our decoding scheme is sequential.

B. Geometric properties about projectors
In this paper, the term orthogonal projector will refer to a
Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues 0 and 1. We shall henceforth use the word projector in place of orthogonal projector.
The following geometric property is crucial to our construction
of a decoding strategy consisting of a sequence of projectors.
The advantage with respect to Winter’s ‘gentle measurement’
lemma [8] is that in the gentle measurement lemma square
roots of the error probabilities under the operations add up,
whereas in our lemma we exploit the fact that each operation
is an orthogonal projection to obtain that the error probabilities
add up. Using Naimark’s theorem to convert POVM elements
to orthogonal projections on larger Hilbert spaces, we get
the same result for lower bounding the success probability
of a sequence of POVM elements applied to a mixed initial
state. Our lemma allows us to avoid dependencies between
the decoding operations that were there in earlier sequential
decoding strategies e.g. in Winter’s strategy [8]. It can be
thought of as a noncommutative union bound and allows us
to lower bound the decoding success probability in a manner
very similar to the classical setting. The proof can be found
in the expanded version.

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Asymptotic smoothing
We use standard facts about typical subspaces from to prove
the following asymptotic smoothing lemma. It will be applied
in the analysis of the decoding error probabilities of all our
decoders henceforth. A proof can be found in the expanded
version.
Lemma 1. Let XZY B be a classical-classical-classicalquantum system with joint density matrix
ρXZY B =
(x,z,y)∈X ×Z×Y

:=

n

pX (x)pZ|X (z|x)pY (y)

Lemma 2 (Noncommutative union bound). Let ρ be a positive
operator on a Hilbert space and Tr ρ ≤ 1. Let Π1 , . . . , Πk

|x, z, y x, z, y| ⊗ ρxzy .

2

be projectors. Let Πi := 1 − Πi be the projector onto the
1
subspace orthogonal to the support of Πi . Then,

Using Fact 1, we can prove the following lemma. This
lemma will be useful in designing a simultaneous decoder
for a ccq-MAC, performing a sequence of projections. The
lemma gives us a notion of approximate intersection of two
conditionally typical subspaces. A proof can be found in the
expanded version.

k

Tr [Πk · · · Π1 ρΠ1 · · · Πk ] ≥ Tr ρ − 2

Tr [ρΠi ].
i=1

Lemma 2 suggests the following natural sequential decoding
paradigm for a channel. Let Π1 , . . . , Πk , . . . be projectors.
Intuitively, if the ith message were sent, the output state ρi
of the channel would have a large projection onto Πi i.e.
Tr Πi ρi ≈ 1. Supppose now that the kth message is sent
resulting in output state ρk of the channel. The decoder tries
to project ρk onto Π1 . If he fails, he then tries to project the
collapsed state onto Π2 . The decoder continues in this fashion.
If he succeeds in projecting onto Πi for some i, he declares i
to be his guess for the sent message. If he fails to project onto
any Πi , he declares failure. Using Lemma 2, we can upper
bound the decoding error probability err(k) of this strategy
by

Lemma 3. Let A , B be subspaces of a Hilbert space H.
Let ΠA , ΠB denote the projectors onto A , B . Let 0 ≤
< 1. Then there exists a (possibly null) subspace A of A
√
2
2
such that for all vectors v ∈ A, ΠB v 2 ≥ (1 − ) v 2 .
Let B be the (possibly null) subspace of B spanned by the
vectors ΠB v,√ ∈ A. Let ΠB be the projector onto B. Then,
v
ΠB ≤ (1 −
)−1 ΠB ΠA ΠB . Suppose furthermore there
is a positive matrix ρ, Tr ρ ≤ 1 with support in A such
that Tr [ρΠB ] ≥ √ − . Then A is a non-null subspace and
1
Tr [ρΠB ] ≥ 1 − 2 .
III. S EQUENTIAL DECODING FOR SINGLE SENDER SINGLE
RECEIVER CHANNEL

k−1

Let C : x → ρx be a channel which takes a classical
input x and outputs a quantum state ρx . We use ρXB :=
x∈X pX (x)|x x|⊗ρx to denote the joint state of the system
Xn
XB. For xn ∈ Tδ , let Πxn denote the conditionally typical
n
Xn
projector Πρx . For xn ∈ Tδ , deﬁne Πxn := 0. Suppose
δ
the sender wants to transmit at rate R using n independent
uses of the channel C. Let his messages be denoted by m,
1 ≤ m ≤ 2nR . The sender uses the random encoding strategy
of Figure 1 to choose a codebook C.

Tr [ρk Πi ] + 1 − Tr [ρk Πk ].

err(k) ≤ 2
i=1

Our quantum sequential decoding paradigm is very analogous
to the natural classical sequential decoding paradigm, and
gives low decoding error probability for any set of messages
{1, 2, . . .} with channel output states {ρ1 , ρ2 , . . .} if we can
ﬁnd, for example, a set of decoding projectors {Π1 , Π2 , . . .}
with the property that for each k, Tr [ρk Πk ] ≈ 1 and
i:i=k Tr [ρk Πi ] ≈ 0. In contrast, the sequential decoding
approach of Winter [8] requires extra conditions on the decoding projectors that involve requiring a sequential ordering
of the messages, which leads to difﬁculties in applying it to
channels with multiple independent senders. The sequential
decoding approach of Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone [9]
is heavily tied to the setting of the cq-channel and requires
independent choice of codewords for different messages in
the error analysis, which again leads to problems in applying
it to channels with multiple independent senders.
In order to construct a simultaneous sequential decoder for
the cq-MAC, we will need the following geometric fact about
how a pair of subspaces interact.

Encoding strategy to create a codebook C
For m = 1 to 2nR , choose xn (m) ∼ X n independently.

Fig. 1.

Encoding strategy for the cq-channel.

For the codebook C, the receiver uses the sequential
decoding strategy of Figure 2. An interesting feature about
our decoder is that it only uses projectors onto conditionally
typical subspaces of candidate messages. In particular, it does
not use any projection onto the typical subspace of the average
message, unlike Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone’s sequential
decoder [9] and many other decoders for the cq-channel
described earlier in the literature. The only other example of
a decoder for the cq-channel that solely uses projectors onto
conditionally typical subspaces of candidate messages that we
are aware of is a pretty good measurement based decoder of
Wilde [15, Exercises 15.5.4 and 19.3.5].
In order to analyse the success probability of decoding
a message correctly, we ﬁrst imagine that we are given a
slightly different channel C working on alphabet X n with
output Hilbert space B ⊗n . It is deﬁned as C : xn → ρxn
Bn
where the states {ρxn }xn ∈X n are as provided by Lemma 1
n n
XB
given state ρ . Let ρ X B be as deﬁned by Lemma 1. The
encoding and decoding strategies used continue to be exactly

Fact 1. Let A, B be subspaces of a Hilbert space H. Then
there is a decomposition of H as an orthogonal direct sum of
the following types of spaces:
1) One dimensional spaces orthogonal to both A and B,
2) One dimensional spaces contained in both A and B,
3) One dimensional spaces contained in A but not in B,
4) One dimensional spaces contained in B but not in A,
5) Two dimensional spaces intersecting A, B each in one
dimensional spaces.
Moreover, the one dimensional spaces in (2) and (3) above
and the one dimensional intersections with A of the two
dimensional spaces in (5) above form an orthonormal basis
of A. A similar statement holds for B.

is that the receiver applies a sequence of projectors Πxn yn
that serve as an approximate intersection of Πxn yn , Πyn .
More precisely, we treat the supports of Πxn yn , Πyn as the

that arises in the decoding error analysis, when we consider
the expected probability of error that occurs when actually a

the output state corresponds to message (m1 , m2 ), m1 = m1 .

bound for the ccq-MAC using a simultaneous decoder. Details
can be found in the expanded version of the paper.

strategy for a MAC with classical inputs and quantum output
with arbitrarily many senders is the main problem left open
by this work. Solving it would likely allow us to extend many
results in classical network information theory to the quantum
setting.

V. T HE INTERFERENCE CHANNEL
We ﬁrst describe the so-called Chong-Motani-Garg threesender MAC, called CMG-MAC for short. Let C : (z, y) →
ρzy be a channel that takes two classical inputs z and y and
outputs a quantum state ρzy . Let X, Z, Y be classical random
variables such that Y is independent of XZ. We deﬁne
ρXZY B

:=

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We are grateful to Omar Fawzi for allowing his observation
that the smaller inner bound on the CMG-MAC does not lead
to a shrinking of the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound for the
interference channel, to be included in the paper. We thank
Mark Wilde, Patrick Hayden and Ivan Savov for going through
preliminary drafts of this paper and giving valuable feedback.

to denote the joint state of the system XZY B. In the CMGMAC there are three senders and one receiver. Let their
messages be denoted by m1 , m2 , m3 . The senders are forced
to use a random encoding strategy where the codeword for
sender 2 is chosen conditional to the codeword of sender 1.
Thus, the encoding strategies of senders 1 and 2 are not
independent in general. However, the encoding strategy of
sender 3 is independent from that of senders 1 and 2. In the
classical setting, the receiver is only interested in recovering
the message pair (m1 , m2 ) correctly. This indifference towards
m3 is modelled by requiring the received word to be jointly
typical with a triple (m1 , m2 , m3 ) where only (m1 , m2 ) has
to be unique. In other words, the receiver checks whether the
received word lies in the union, over m3 , of the typical sets
for (m1 , m2 , m3 ) for a unique (m1 , m2 ). A naive quantum
analogue would be to replace the union of sets by the span
of subspaces. However, this leads to a problem because of
the geometric fact that a vector can have a large projection
onto the span of two subspaces even though its projections
onto the individual subspaces are small. In fact, the vector
can even lie in the span! However, it turns out that requiring
the receiver to also decode m3 correctly does not decrease
the achievable inner bound for the interference channel even
though it decreases the achievable inner bound for the CMGMAC. We thus prove the following inner bound for the CMGMAC. Note that the ﬁrst constraint, namely the constraint on
R3 , is what shrinks the quantum inner bound with respect to
the classical.

The proof is similar to that of the ccq-MAC described above,
but exploits the dependence between X and Z in a crucial way.
We can ﬁnally achieve the Chong-Motani-Garg inner bound
for the ccqq-IC using the above inner bound for the CMGMAC using a geometric analysis of the rate region and other
standard techniques. Details can be found in the expanded
version of the paper.
Finally, we note that if X and Z were actually independent,
that is, if we had to code for a three sender MAC, then
our techniques would fail. Finding a simultaneous decoding
