ﬁnite-state channels with feedback based on

proposed a simple sequential transmission scheme for the
binary symmetric channel (BSC) which is capacity-achieving
and provides a larger error exponent than traditional ﬁxedlength block-coding. Similarly, Schalkwijk and Kailath [11]
showed that capacity and a double exponentially decreasing
error probability can be achieved by a simple sequential
transmission scheme for the additive white Gaussian noise
channel (AWGNC) with average power constraint. Recently,
Shayevitz and Feder [12]–[14] identiﬁed an underlying principle shared by the aforementioned Horstein and SchalkwijkKailath schemes and introduced a simple encoding scheme,
namely the posterior matching scheme (PMS) for general
memoryless channels. Furthermore, they showed that the PMS
achieves the capacity of general discrete memoryless channels
(DMCs). Subsequently, Coleman [15] revisited the PMS and
reformulated the problem in a stochastic control framework.
In [16], [17] the authors proposed a PMS scheme for channels
with memory and state and output feedback.
In this paper, we investigate potentially capacity-achieving
transmission schemes for a special class of ﬁnite-state channels
(FSC), namely uniﬁlar FSCs, where the channel state at
time t + 1 is a deterministic function of the current state
input and output. Based on the derived capacity expression,
and the structure of the capacity-achieving input distribution
derived in [5], we propose a PMS-like sequential transmission
scheme. Intuitively, the transmitter and receiver both update
a “state” which includes the a-posteriori distribution of the
transmitted message conditioned on the observation output for
all current states. At the same time, the transmitter is sending
the most informative input symbol in such a way that the
state-conditioned input distribution is the one implied by the
capacity expression. Due to the presence of ISI, the proposed
scheme has a number of unique characteristics that were
not present in the PMS proposed for memoryless channels.
Regarding the methodology followed for proving zero rate
achievability, we generalize the tools utilized in [14], [16],
[17].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, the channel model and some preliminaries are introduced. The generalized PMS is presented in Section III and

Abstract—The capacity of uniﬁlar ﬁnite-state channels with
feedback has been recently derived in the form of a single-letter
expression and it has been evaluated analytically for a number of
channels of interest, such as the trapdoor channel and the Ising
channel with feedback. In this paper, we investigate transmission
schemes for this class of channels. These schemes are inspired by
the posterior matching scheme (PMS) introduced for memoryless
channels with feedback. The transmission scheme is proven to
achieve zero rate and is conjectured to achieve channel capacity.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Communication in the presence of feedback has been a
long studied problem which dates back to Shannon’s early
work [1], showing that feedback cannot increase the capacity
of memoryless channels. For channels with memory, however,
feedback may increase the capacity.
One of the ﬁrst results on the capacity of channels with
memory and feedback was by Viswanathan [2], who studied
the capacity of a ﬁnite-state channel (FSC) with receiver
channel-state information (CSI) and delayed feedback in the
absence of inter-symbol interference (ISI). Later, Chen and
Berger [3] derived the capacity of a FSC with ISI where
current (i.e., not delayed) CSI is available at the transmitter
and the receiver. Yang et. al. [4] used a stochastic control
methodology to ﬁnd the capacity of the ISI channel (where
the evolution of the state is deterministic). In a related line
of work, the authors of [5], [6] derived a single-letter expression for the class of uniﬁlar channels and used dynamic
programming to evaluate analytically the channel capacity for
the trapdoor and the Ising channels with feedback. Recently,
Tatikonda and Mitter [7] provided a general stochastic control framework for evaluating the capacity of the FSC with
feedback. In that work, the capacity was characterized as the
solution of a dynamic programming average reward optimality
equation (AROE). Como et. al. [8] used an approach similar
to that in [7] to ﬁnd the capacity of the FSC when current
CSI is available at the transmitter and the receiver. An upper
bound on the capacity of the FSC without ISI and CSI was
found using dynamic programming by Huang et. al. [9].
A signiﬁcant amount of research has also been done in the
area of code design for channels with memory. Horstein [10]

III. T HE POSTERIOR MATCHING TRANSMISSION SCHEME
In this section we describe a sequential transmission
scheme for the uniﬁlar FSC with unit-delay output feedback. We assume that the capacity achieving distributions
(P (Xt |St , Bt−1 ))St ,Bt−1 have been found for all values of
(St , Bt−1 ) ∈ S × P(S). We consider transmission of a
message W ∈ [0, 1). Let F be the set of all valid cdfs over
[0, 1) and deﬁne the random variable Ft′ ∈ S → F as

II. C HANNEL MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES
We consider channels with input, output and state random
processes denoted by (Xt )∞ , (Yt )∞ , (St )∞ , respectively.
t=1
t=1
t=1
The corresponding input, output and state alphabets are ﬁnite
and denoted by X , Y, and S, respectively. For reasons that
will become clear in the following we also assume that
X = {0, 1, . . . , |X | − 1}. At time t the receiver has access
to the current channel output Yt , which is also fed back to
the transmitter with unit delay. The state transition and the
channel output are deﬁned as
P (Yt |S t , X t , Y t−1 ) = Q(Yt |Xt , St )

def

With the above deﬁnition, Ft′ (·|s) is the a-posteriori cdf of W
conditioned on St+1 = s, Y t , and Ft′ is the collection of all
these conditional cdfs for all s ∈ S. In the following we will
def
also use the notation Ft′ (w) = (Ft′ (w|s))s∈S , as well as the
def
′
′
notation Ft (s) = Ft (·|s); the distinction should be obvious
from the context.
The channel input Xt for t = 1, 2, 3, . . . is generated as

(1a)

St+1 = g(St , Xt , Yt )

Ft′ (w|s) = P (W ≤ w|St+1 = s, Y t ), w ∈ [0, 1), s ∈ S. (7)

(1b)

′
Xt = FP (·|St ,Bt−1 ) (Ft−1 (W |St ))

def

Bt (s) = P (St+1 = s|Y t )

∀s ∈ S.

sup
P (Xt |St ,Bt−1 )

I(Xt , St ∧ Yt |Bt−1 )

−1
where the inverse cdf is deﬁned as FP (y) = inf{x : FP (x) ≥
y} and FP denotes the cdf corresponding to a random variable
with distribution P . The initial posterior cdfs are set to be
′
uniform, i.e., F0 (w|s) = w for w ∈ [0, 1). This transmission scheme is similar to the PMS scheme proposed for
DMCs in [14] with the following differences. First, the input
signal Xt is matched to the capacity achieving distribution
P (Xt |St , Bt−1 ) which is not constant, but changes depending
on the current values of the quantities St , Bt−1 . Second, the
encoding scheme is a function of the message W through the
value Ft′ (W |St ) and thus an appropriate “state” for the transmitter involves the entire vector Ft′ (W ) = (Ft′ (W |s))s∈S .
Third, the additional “state” variable Bt can be recursively
updated through the update equation Bt = θ(Bt−1 , Yt )
as shown in (6), and the current state St is available at
the transmitter at time t due to the uniﬁlar property, i.e.,
St = g(St−1 , Xt−1 , Yt−1 ) = g (X t−1 , Y t−1 )1 . The proposed
˜
transmission scheme is also similar to the one in [16] and [17,
ch. 5] for ISI FSCs with the difference being that in the above
references the channel is not necessarily uniﬁlar, and CSI is
available at the receiver and with unit delay at the transmitter.
We now show that the quantity Ft′ can also be evaluated
recursively at the transmitter. Indeed, the corresponding pdf
can be updated as shown in (9) with P (Yt |Bt−1 ) derived from
the joint distribution in (4). Integrating out (9) results in an
explicit recursion for the cdfs Ft′ . We will use the shorthand
notation
′
Ft′ = ϕ(Ft−1 , Bt−1 , Yt )
(10)
def

(2)

(3)

where the mutual information in (3) is evaluated with the joint
distribution
P (Xt , Yt , St , Bt−1 ) =
Q(Yt |Xt , St )P (Xt |St , Bt−1 )Bt−1 (St )P (Bt−1 ),

(4)

where P (Bt−1 ) is the steady-state distribution of the induced
Markov process (Bt )t deﬁned by the conditional distribution

P (Bt |Bt−1 ) =

Their results (although not presented in this form) imply that
under mild conditions the capacity of uniﬁlar FSCs can be put
in a single-letter expression of the form

= e(Ft−1 (W ), St , Bt−1 ).

for a given stochastic kernel Q ∈ X × S → P(Y) and a
deterministic function g ∈ S × X × Y → S, where we denote
by P(A) the set of distributions on A. These channels are
referred to as uniﬁlar ﬁnite-state channels (FSCs) [5], [6].
In [5] the authors formulated the problem of ﬁnding the
capacity of uniﬁlar FSCs with unit-delayed output feedback
as a stochastic control problem. The basic idea was to deﬁne
a controlled Markov process with state Bt ∈ P(S) deﬁned as

Q(yt |xt , st )P (xt |st , Bt−1 )Bt−1 (st ), (5)

xt ,st

and θ is given by the recursive updating of Bt = θ(Bt−1 , Yt )
as shown in (6). We note that the above expressions can also
be derived from the general framework developed in [7] as
a special case. It was further shown in [5] that the capacity
expression can, be evaluated as the solution of an appropriate
average reward optimality equation (AROE) [18]. For the special case of the trapdoor and the Ising channels with feedback
the authors provided analytical solutions to the AROE in [5],
[6].

for the above update. It can be shown from (9) that Ft′ (w)
′
′
is a function of Ft−1 only through Ft−1 (w). This has important implications for the analysis of the PMS scheme.

the above recursions, as well as the recursions (6) and (9) for

evaluate the posterior cdf Ft recursively. Finally, the message

third inequality is due to the concavity of ξ, the fourth inequality is due to repeated application of the above inequalities, and
the (uniform) convergence to 0 is due to the property of the
contraction [14, Lemma 8].
It remains to ﬁnd the contraction ξ with the aforementioned
property. To this end let λ′ : [0, 0.5] → [0, 1] be a restriction

are non-zero for all x, y, s, b, the recursions in (9) and (6)

Clearly, ξ ∗ (x) ≥ 0. We will now show that ξ ∗ satisﬁes
def
the aforementioned property. Indeed, let a = ft−1 (w). If
′−1
a ∈ [0, 1/2] then λ (λ(a)) = a and the ﬁrst term in
the maximization on the r.h.s. of (28) (for x = λ(a))
˜
equals ξ(a). If a ∈ [1/2, 1] then 1 − λ′−1 (λ(a)) = a and
the second term in the maximization of the r.h.s. of (28)
˜
˜
(for x = λ(a)) equals ξ(a). Thus, ξ ∗ (λ(a)) ≥ ξ(a) ≥

E[λ(ψ(ft−1 (w), bt−1 , Yt ))|bt−1 , ft−1 ].
The remaining of the proof is similar to the one developed
for DMC’s in [14] and will not be repeated here.
The above result can be used to show that rate R = 0 is
achievable.
Proposition 1. If the channel is ﬁxed-point free, then for ϵ, δ >
0
lim P (Ft (W − δ) > ϵ) = 0,

(29a)

lim P (Ft (W + δ) < 1 − ϵ) = 0.

Proof: The proof is exactly the same as in the DMC case
and can be found in [17, Appendix A].
B. Achieving R < C
Following similar steps as the ones followed [17] to show
capacity achievability for the PMS scheme for ﬁnite state
channels with both output and state feedback, one may now
prove achievability for any rate up to capacity. An alternative
proof of achievability may be pursued based on the ideas of
stochastic nonlinear ﬁlter stability described in [19]. In the
following we state the achievability of R < C as a conjecture.
Conjecture 1. For any δ, α > 0
lim P (F(1+α)t (W − 2−tR ) > δ) = 0,

(30a)

lim P (F(1+α)t (W + 2−tR ) < 1 − δ) = 0.

VI. C ONCLUSIONS
Starting from a single-letter capacity expression for uniﬁlar
FSC with output feedback, we propose a sequential transmission scheme that is inspired by the PMS developed for
memoryless channels and FSC with output and state feedback.
The proposed scheme is shown to be have a recursive structure
and it possesses the properties that every PMS scheme should
possess. The proposed scheme is shown to achieve zero rate
for the aforementioned channels by extending the achievability
proof developed for memoryless channels. An interesting
future research direction is the analysis of the error probability
of this (and other) PMS schemes and in particular the error
exponent analysis. In addition, an alternative uniﬁed proof of
the achievability of PMS-like schemes may be pursued based
