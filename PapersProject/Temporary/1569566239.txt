In this paper, we develop a new layered broadcast approach, which integrates our secure superposition coding in
[5] and embedded coding in [7] in a hybrid fashion across
two dimensional channel states, and which can be shown
to outperform our previous approach for the cases when
the eavesdropper’s channel is fading. The basic idea is that
for the same legitimate receiver’s channel state, layers of
messages corresponding to different eavesdropper’s states are
ﬁrst encoded into a single code using stochastic encoding in
an embedded fashion so that lower layers of messages serve
as randomization for protecting higher layers of messages,
and then codes corresponding to different legitimate receiver’s
states are encoded using superposition coding. Depending on
its channel state, the legitimate receiver can decode messages
up to a certain layer, and depending on the eavesdropper’s
channel state, messages down to a certain layer can be kept
secure from the eavesdropper. Although the legitimate receiver
does not know which layers of messages are kept secure from
the eavesdropper, it knows the probability that each layer is
secure. Hence, in practice the messages with higher levels of
security demands should be encoded into layers with larger
indices so that these messages are less likely to be learned by
the eavesdropper. Based on this scheme, we derive the average
secrecy rate over a large number of blocks for any given power
allocation across the layers of messages. This new broadcast
approach also enables us to characterize the power allocation
across layers that maximizes the average secrecy rate based
on the techniques developed for the problem of constrained
calculus of variations.
We note that the broadcast approach does not guarantee that
all transmitted messages are kept secure from the eavesdropper for all eavesdropper’s states. The actual eavesdropper’s
channel state realization determines which layers of messages
are secure, and the probability that such a state occurs determines the probability of achieving the corresponding secrecy
rate. We hence introduce and study a notion of probabilistic
secrecy, which characterizes the probability that certain layers
of decoded messages are kept secure, i.e., the probability
that the corresponding secrecy rate is achievable. We note
that this study is different from the recent studies of fading
wiretap channels (see, e.g., [8]–[10]), which do not consider
probabilistic secrecy.
We ﬁnally provide numerical examples to demonstrate the
impact of CSI at the transmitter if not available and the channel

Abstract—Broadcasting over the fading wiretap channel is investigated for the situation without the channel state information
(CSI) at the transmitter and subject to a delay constraint. A
new broadcast approach is developed, which integrates secure
superposition coding studied in the authors’ previous work and
embedded coding in a hybrid fashion. This scheme outperforms
the previous approaches for the cases when the eavesdropper’s
channel is fading. The secrecy rate achievable via the new
broadcast approach is derived, and the structure of the optimal
power allocation function across the secure coding layers is
characterized via techniques for solving the problem of constrained calculus of variations. A notion of probabilistic secrecy is
introduced and studied, which characterizes the probability that
a certain secrecy rate is achieved for any given fading block.
Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the impact of
CSI at the transmitter if not available and the channel ﬂuctuation
of the eavesdropper on the average secrecy rate.

I. I NTRODUCTION
As physical layer security (see [1], [2] and recent reviews
on this topic [3], [4]) exploits physical channel statistics to
achieve secure communication, successful implementation of
this approach depends crucially on the transmitter’s knowledge
about the channel state information (CSI), which determines
channel statistics to the legitimate receiver and to the eavesdropper. However, in wireless networks, such CSI may not be
available to the transmitter possibly due to limited feedback
resources. Thus, the design of physical layer security under
channel uncertainty is essential for effectively implementing
this technique.
Towards this goal, in the authors’ recent work [5], the
fading block wiretap channel with CSI known only at the
corresponding receivers was studied. A delay constraint is
assumed so that messages must be transmitted within one
block. The design goal is to achieve as high a secrecy rate
as the legitimate receiver’s channel supports, and as the
eavesdropper’s channel permits. Since the CSI is unknown
to the transmitter, communication schemes should not exploit
the CSI but still adapt to the actual channel state that occurs
in order to achieve the best secrecy performance possible.
In [5], we developed a layered broadcast approach based on
superposing multiple layers of secure codes together across
two dimensional channel states with each layer corresponding
to one legitimate and eavesdropper state pair and with each
layer employing stochastic encoding to achieve secrecy. This
is a natural generalization of the broadcast approach initially
proposed in [6] for the fading channel without eavesdroppers.

ﬂuctuation of the eavesdropper on the average secrecy rate.
Our numerical results suggest that the legitimate receiver’s CSI
affects the secrecy rates much more than the eavesdropper’s
CSI. Without the legitimate receiver’s CSI, the transmitter has
to spread its power to accommodate a number of possible state
realizations, and such power spreading reduces the secrecy
rate. However, the eavesdropper’s CSI affects mostly the legitimate receiver’s knowledge about which layers of messages
are secure, but does not affect much the amount of information
that is kept secure from the eavesdropper. Another important
factor that affects the secrecy rate is the channel ﬂuctuation
(i.e., fading) of the eavesdropper, which creates opportunities
for achieving better secrecy rates.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section
II, we introduce our system model. In Sections III and IV,
we study the scenarios when the fading states are discrete
and continuous, respectively, and in Section V, we provide
numerical results. Finally, in Section VI, we conclude the
paper with some comments on future directions.

In this paper, it is not required that all messages transmitted
over the channel be perfectly secure. However, our performance measure is the secrecy rate of the messages that are
kept secure from the eavesdropper. If all messages transmitted
over one block are viewed as a single message, then our
performance measure can be interpreted as the level of secrecy
achieved for this message. Furthermore, we are interested in
characterizing the secrecy rate under the delay constraint, but
averaged over a large number of blocks, i.e., the average
secrecy rate over blocks.
We also introduce the notion of probabilistic secrecy, which
characterizes the probability that a certain secrecy rate of
decoded messages can be achieved during a block.
III. D ISCRETE C HANNEL S TATES
In this section, we study the case in which the legitimate
receiver and the eavesdropper have ﬁnite numbers of channel
states, and use this to illustrate the improved layered broadcast
approach that we use. In this case, two fading states H and
G take one of H1 , . . . , HL values and one of G1 , . . . , GK
values, respectively, where |H1 | < · · · < |HL | and |G1 | <
· · · < |GK |. For each 1 ≤ l ≤ L, we use Kl to denote the
largest index of the state level of G that is below Hl , i.e., Kl =
max|Gk |≤|Hl | k. We ﬁrst split the entire message into a number
of components Wl[1,Kl ] for 1 ≤ l ≤ L, where Wl[1,Kl ] denotes
Wl1 , . . . , WlKl . Here, each message component corresponds to
one pair of channel states (H, G) = (Hl , Gk ) for 1 ≤ k ≤ Kl
and 1 ≤ l ≤ L.

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
In this paper, we study the fading wiretap channel, in which
a transmitter sends a message to a legitimate receiver and
wishes to keep this message secret from an eavesdropper. Both
the legitimate receiver’s and the eavesdropper’s channels are
corrupted not only by additive complex Gaussian noise, but
also by multiplicative fading gain coefﬁcients. The channel
input-output relationship for one channel use is given by
Y = HX + W

and Z = GX + V

(1)

where X is the input from the transmitter, Y and Z are outputs
at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, respectively,
H and G are fading channel gain coefﬁcients, and the noise
variables W and V are proper complex Gaussian random
variables with zero means and unit variances. The noise
variables are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
over channel uses. The fading gains H and G are assumed to
experience block fading, i.e, they are constant within a block
and change independently across blocks. The block length is
assumed to be sufﬁciently long such that one codeword can be
successfully transmitted if properly constructed. The channel
input is subject to an average power constraint P over each
n
1
block, i.e., n i=1 E |Xi |2 ≤ P where i denotes the symbol
time (i.e., channel use) index, and where n is the blocklength.
It is assumed that the transmitter does not know the instantaneous CSI, and each receiver knows its own channel
state. Each message is required to be transmitted within one
block, i.e., the message is transmitted under a delay constraint.
The legitimate receiver is required to decode the transmitted
message with a small probability of error at the end of each
block, and the message needs to be kept as secure as possible
from the eavesdropper. The measure of security is based on the
1
equivocation rate given by n H(W |Z n ) where Z n denotes the
received outputs at the eavesdropper over one block, and hence
depends on the channel state realization of the eavesdropper
during this block. The message W is kept secure from the

Deﬁnition 1. A secrecy rate tuple {Rl[1,Kl ] }l=1,...,L is achievable if there exists a coding scheme that encodes the messages
Wl[1,Kl ] at the rates Rl[1,Kl ] for 1 ≤ l ≤ L such that if the
legitimate receiver’s channel is at Hl and the eavesdropper’s
channel is at Gk for 1 ≤ l ≤ L and 1 ≤ k ≤ Kl , then the
legitimate receiver decodes the message Wlk correctly, and
the eavesdropper is kept ignorant of the message Wlk .
We note that the above deﬁnition implies that if
{Rl[1,Kl ] }l=1,...,L is achievable, then the legitimate receiver at
the state Hl can decode all messages W1[1,K1 ] , . . . , Wl[1,Kl ] ,
and all W1[k,K1 ] , . . . , WL[k,KL ] are kept secure from the
eavesdropper at the state Gk .
We develop an improved broadcast approach that integrates
two broadcast techniques of superposition coding and embedded coding. Corresponding to each legitimate receiver’s
state Hl , all messages Wl[1,Kl ] , i.e., the message components Wl1 , . . . , WlKl corresponding to different eavesdropper’s channel states, are encoded into one codeword in an
embedded fashion as in [7]. In particular, lower layers of
(i.e., indexed) messages serve as randomization for protecting higher layers of messages from the eavesdropper. These
embedded codewords corresponding to different legitimate receiver’s channel states are then combined using superposition

achievable secrecy rate tuples in the following theorem.

receiver having one of L fading states H1 , . . . , HL with
|H1 | < · · · < |HL | and the eavesdropper having one of

codeword xn (ql , wl1 , . . . , wlKl ). Here, ql is for randomization,
l
and Wl1 , . . . , WlKl are encoded in an embedded fashion so
that lower indexed messages also serve as randomization
for higher indexed messages. The input transmitted over
the channel is then generated by superposing all codewords
corresponding to l = 1, . . . , L together and is given by
L
xn = l=1 xn (ql , wl1 , . . . , wlKl ).

It can be shown that there exists a codebook as described
above such that if the legitimate receiver has the channel
n
state Hl , then it can decode X1 , . . . , Xln , and hence the
messages W1[1,K1 ] , . . . , Wl[1,Kl ] , with a small probability of
error, and if the eavesdropper’s channel is at Gk , the messages
W1[k,K1 ] , . . . , WL[k,KL ] are kept secure from the eavesdropper, which concludes the proof. The details of the proof are
omitted due to space limitations, and can be found at [11].

It can be seen from the above theorem that if the legitimate
receiver’s channel is ﬁxed (i.e., has only a single state), then
the secrecy rate for a given block is equal to the secrecy
capacity for the corresponding eavesdropper’s channel state,
although not all messages transmitted are kept secure. This
is due to the incorporation of embedded coding, which prevents the transmitter’s power from unnecessary spreading over
superposed layers corresponding to different eavesdropper’s
states as in our previous approach in [5]. Hence, the proposed
broadcast approach here is an improved approach.
Outline of Proof of Theorem 1: The basic idea of the
improved broadcast approach is described above, and we now
outline our achievable scheme in more detail as follows. We
construct a codebook that contains L subcodebook layers,
denoted by Cl for l = 1, . . . , L, corresponding to L states
of the legitimate receiver’s channel. For each layer l, the subn log 1+

We now generalize our result in the preceding section to
the case in which the channel states take continuous values.
For each channel state pair (H, G) = (h, g), we let (s, u) =
(|h|2 |, |g|2 ), and use (s, u) to index layers of messages. We
denote the cumulative distribution functions for s and u as
F (·) and Q(·), respectively, and the corresponding probability
density functions as f (·) and q(·), respectively. For each layer
s, we assume that the transmitter allocates power ρ(s)ds, and
we use Σ(s) to denote the total power allocated to the layers
with better channel states, i.e., the states s such that s > s.

Hence, Σ(s) = s ρ(x)dx and ρ(s) = −Σ (s).
Following from Theorem 1, we obtain the following result
on the average secrecy rate.

The proof of the above proposition is omitted due to space
limitations and can be found in [11]. We note that from the
legitimate receiver’s point of view, since it knows its own
channel state, the conditional probability P (R|s) = Q(uR (s))
characterizes the probability of achieving a certain secrecy rate
R at a given block with the state s = |H|2 . It is also clear that
under probabilistic secrecy, we may achieve a positive secrecy
rate for a given block with certain channel state realizations
although such achievement is with a certain probability. However, under a deterministic secrecy constraint that requires
all transmitted messages to be secure from the eavesdropper,
zero secrecy rate can be achieved for any block. Even over
a large number of blocks, the secrecy rate is zero under a
deterministic secrecy constraint if the legitimate receiver and
the eavesdropper have the same channel statistics whereas the
secrecy rate may be positive under the probabilistic secrecy.

if s > u, and R(s, u) = 0 if s ≤ u. An illustration of the
layers of messages that contribute to the secrecy rate R(s, u)
is depicted in Fig. 1.
Averaging the above rate over all fading state realizations
of the legitimate receiver’s channel and the eavesdropper’s
channel, we obtain the desired result. The details can be found
in [11].
In order to obtain the optimal average secrecy rate R given
in (3), we need to solve the following optimization problem:

Σ∗ (x) is strictly decreasing over the interval [x1 , x0 ], which
suggests that the optimal solution is unique if it exists.

The proof of Theorem 2 is based on techniques for optimizing the constrained calculus of variation problem in [12]
and the monotonic property of Σ∗ (x). The details of the proof
is omitted due to space limitations and can be found in [11].

We have also introduced a notion of probabilistic secrecy,
and characterized the probability that a given secrecy rate is
achievable. Moreover, we have provided numerical results to
demonstrate how the CSI at the transmitter and the channel
ﬂuctuation of the eavesdropper affect the average secrecy
rate. The methodology here can also address the problem of
broadcasting over a network, in which different users enjoy
different signal-to-noise ratio values, and probabilistic secrecy
now corresponds to sets of eavesdroppers that are ignorant
of different information layers for different users. Another
aspect for future work is to extend the notion of secrecy to the
variable-to-ﬁxed secrecy rate in the same spirit of the relation
between the classical broadcast approach and the variable-toﬁxed channel coding concept [13].

Comparison of rates for the three scenarios

We now provide numerical results for the case in Example
1, in which s = |H|2 and u = |G|2 are independent and
exponential with the parameters σ1 = 2 and σ2 = 0.5,
1

i.e., p(s) = σ1 e−s/σ1 and p(u) = σ2 e−u/σ2 . In Fig. 3, we
plot the average secrecy rates for the case when both the
legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper’s channels are fading,
and compare them to the cases when only the legitimate
receiver’s channel is fading and when only the eavesdropper’s
channel is fading. In all of these three scenarios, the transmitter
does not have the CSI. It is clear from the ﬁgure that the case
when only the eavesdropper’s channel is fading has better
rates than the case when both the channels are fading due
to the knowledge of the legitimate receiver’s CSI (which is
ﬁxed) at the transmitter for the ﬁrst case. However, it may
seem counter-intuitive that the case when both the channels are
fading has better rates than the case when only the legitimate
receiver’s channel is fading. This is due to the fact that when
the eavesdropper’s channel is fading, there is a good chance
that its state is below the channel average, and such channel
ﬂuctuation facilitates achievement of a better secrecy rate
and overcomes the effect of no eavesdropper’s CSI at the
transmitter. Therefore, the two major factors that affect the
secrecy rate are the knowledge of the legitimate receiver’s
CSI and the channel ﬂuctuation of the eavesdropper. The
knowledge of the eavesdropper’s CSI only weakly affects the
secrecy rate.

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have developed a new broadcast approach
that integrates secure superposition coding in our previous
work [5] and a generalization of embedded coding in [7].
