distortions close to the rate-distortion bound for large blocklengths. Later, similar results were reported with modiﬁed
forms of BP [15, 16]. The performance of these algorithms
also depends on the choice of degree distributions for LDGM
codes. A heuristic choice is to use degree distributions that have
been optimized for LDPC codes on binary symmetric channel
[14–16]. No rigorous analysis exists to date which can explain
why this is the case.
In the present contribution, we study a spatially coupled
LDGM ensemble for lossy source compression. Two of us
[17] studied such ensembles in the context of rateless codes
(channel coding) and demonstrated that threshold saturation
takes place. We provide numerical evidence showing that a
similar effect occurs in lossy compression. In particular, the
BPGD distortion of the coupled LDGM ensemble approaches
(numerically) the optimal distortion of the underlying ensemble. We use the simplest forms of BP and decimation
processes, and we take regular degrees. It is noteworthy that
no optimization is needed, thus suggesting that the observed
saturation is related to fundamental principles. Regular (underlying) LDGM ensembles with large degrees have an optimal
distortion that approaches the rate-distortion limit. Thus with
spatially coupled LDGM codes with regular large degrees
and a BPGD algorithm we can attain the Shannon limit. The
complexity of the encoding scheme presented here is O(n2 L2 )
where L is the number of copies of the underlying ensemble
and n the size of each copy.
In section II, we brieﬂy review lossy compression and explain the structure of coupled LDGM ensembles. In section III,
we formulate lossy compression as an optimization problem
and compute the optimal distortion for underlying and coupled
LDGM ensembles, by using the SP formalism. In section IV,
we formulate and discuss the BPGD algorithm. Simulation
results for this algorithm are presented in section V. A few
practical issues are discussed in section VI.

Abstract—We study a new encoding scheme for lossy source
compression based on spatially coupled low-density generatormatrix codes. We develop a belief-propagation guided-decimation
algorithm, and show that this algorithm allows to approach
the optimal distortion of spatially coupled ensembles. Moreover,
using the survey propagation formalism, we also observe that
the optimal distortions of the spatially coupled and individual
code ensembles are the same. Since regular low-density generatormatrix codes are known to achieve the Shannon rate-distortion
bound under optimal encoding as the degrees grow, our results suggest that spatial coupling can be used to reach the
rate-distortion bound, under a low complexity belief-propagation
guided-decimation algorithm.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The spatial coupling of copies of a graphical code was
introduced in [1] in the form of convolutional low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes. The performance of such ensembles under the belief propagation (BP) algorithm is consistently
better than the performance of the underlying ensembles [2–4].
The key observation is that the BP threshold of a coupled ensemble considerably improves and gets close to the maximum
a posteriori (MAP) threshold of the underlying ensemble. This
threshold saturation phenomenon has been studied rigorously
in [5, 6]. Furthermore, it has been investigated in other models
such as the Curie-Weiss chain, random satisﬁability, graph
coloring [7–9], and compressed sensing [10, 11].
One of the classic problems in communications is lossy
source compression. The objective is to compress a given
sequence, so that it can be reconstructed up to some speciﬁed distortion. For binary symmetric sources, low-density
generator-matrix (LDGM) codes are able to asymptotically
achieve Shannon’s rate-distortion bound under optimal encoding (minimum distance encoding) [12, 13]. However, this is
not a computationally efﬁcient scheme.
LDGM codes are well-suited to low-complexity message
passing algorithms such as the BP algorithm. But using LDGM
codes with a plain BP algorithm is not very effective in lossy
compression. To achieve more promising results, one can equip
the BP algorithm with a decimation process. The general idea
of belief-propagation guided-decimation (BPGD) algorithms is
to: i) compute BP marginals, ii) ﬁx bits with the largest bias, iii)
decimate the graph. Decimation reduces the graph to a smaller
one, on which this process is repeated. Many variants of
message passing algorithms and various decimation processes
have been investigated. In [14] a survey propagation (SP)
inspired decimation algorithm is proposed. Simulations show

1) Lossy Compression of Symmetric Bernoulli Sources: Let

We have X = {X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn }, where {Xa }n are i.i.d

random variables with P{Xa = 1} = 2 , for a ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
We compress a given source word x by mapping it to one of
the 2nR index words u ∈ U = {0, 1}nR , where R ∈ [0, 1] is
the rate. The stored sequence u then deﬁnes a reconstructed
source sequence x(u) ∈ X , where the source decoding map
u → x(u) depends on the structure of the code. For a given
pair (x, x), the distortion is measured by Hamming distance

1
the reconstruction is measured by D := n EX (dH (x, x)).
For the symmetric Bernoulli source, it is well-known that
for any scheme, the average distortion is lower-bounded by
Dsh , deﬁned implicitly by the rate-distortion function h(Dsh ) =
1
1 − R, Dsh ∈ [0, 2 ]. Here h(·) is the binary entropy function.
The goal is to ﬁnd an encoding scheme such that, for a given
R, it achieves the rate-distortion lower bound.
For this purpose, we study LDGM codes since they are able
to achieve the rate-distortion bound under the optimal encoding
when the average degrees increase [12].
2) LDGM Codes: Consider an LDGM code of block length
n and rate R = m . Let u1 , · · · , um be m code-bits of the
n
index word u and let x1 , x2 , · · · , xn be n reconstruction bits
of the source word x1 , x2 , · · · , xn . An LDGM code is usually
represented by a bipartite graph as depicted in Figure 1. Call
this graph Γ(C, G; E). Each code-bit ui is represented by a
node i ∈ C(Γ). For each reconstruction bit xa , there is a
generator node a ∈ G(Γ). Each edge (i, a) ∈ E(Γ) shows that
the code-bit ui is connected to the corresponding reconstruction
bit xa . We denote by ∂a the set of all code-bit nodes connected
to a ∈ G, i.e. ∂a = {i ∈ C| (i, a) ∈ E}. Similarly, for i ∈ C,
∂i = {a ∈ G| (i, a) ∈ E}. Thus, the reconstructed bit xa is
obtained from the code-bits u by a mod 2 sum xa = ⊕i∈∂a ui .
In this paper, we focus on the (l, r, n)-regular LDGM
random ensemble, where l (resp. r) is the degree of generator (resp. code-bit) nodes. We refer to [18] for the detailed
construction of this ensemble.
3) Chain of LDGM(l, r, n) Ensembles: Consider L sets of
l
nodes each having m = r n code-bit nodes and n generator
nodes (and reconstruction nodes). Locate the sets in positions 0
to L − 1 on a circle (see Figure 2). We randomly connect each
generator node in position z ∈ [0, L − 1], to l code-bit nodes
from w sets in the range [z, z + w − 1]. Eventually (for large
n and m) code-bit nodes have degree r. The details of this
construction are explained in [5, 17]. Note that this ensemble
has the same local structure as the underlying LDGM(l, r)
ensemble. Because of the global circular structure, we call it
a Closed Chain LDGM(l, r, L, w, n) ensemble (CCLDGM).
We wish to point out a difference between the present
construction and the ones used so far in channel coding. The
latter are based on open linear chains with suitable boundary
conditions that help initiate the decoding process, which then
propagates like a wave through the system. In the present
periodic construction, encoding will be seeded by preferential
decimation at a speciﬁc position (say z = L/2), in an initial

phase of the BPGD algorithm.
III. O PTIMAL E NCODING AND D ISTORTION
A. Optimal Encoding
Let Γ be the factor graph of a random instance of an
LDGM(l, r, n) ensemble or CCLDGM(l, r, L, w, n) ensemble.
We are looking for a conﬁguration u∗ that minimizes the
distortion between x and x(u), i.e.
dmin := min

dH (x, x) =
dH (x, ⊕i∈∂a u∗ ) .

Note that for the individual ensemble L = 1. As we are
interested in the average distortion of the ensemble over all
X ∈ X , we deﬁne the optimal distortion as
Dopt = EΓ,X (dmin ).

(2)

We transform the above minimization problem into a maximum likelihood problem by equipping the conﬁguration space

with the following probability measure,

where β ∈ R+ is a non-negative parameter, and Z(β|x) =
−βdH (x,x)
the normalizing factor. The minimizer u∗ in (1)
ue
maximizes the measure, i.e, maxu µβ (u | x) = µβ (u∗ | x).
Moreover, for a particular x, the minimal distortion can be
obtained as dmin = −(nL)−1 limβ→∞ β −1 ln Z (β | x) . This
formulation of the problem allows to use techniques from statistical physics to compute Dopt . In the physics interpretation,
dH and µβ are a random hamiltonian and Gibbs measure, β
is an inverse temperature, Z a partition function, Dopt is the
average ground state energy. The latter can be computed by
the SP formalism.
B. Computation of the Optimal Distortion
The details of the SP equations, used to compute Dopt ,
are not shown here. A pedagogical account of the formalism
can be found in [19]. The numerical solution of the SP
equations shows that the optimal distortions for the underlying
LDGM(l, r) and CCLDGM(l, r, L, w) are the same for each
ﬁnite w and L (here n and m are inﬁnite). In fact, for an

This represents the tendency of the code-bit to be 0 or 1. Our
BPGD algorithm shown in Algorithm 1, uses a decimation
condition. Let > 0 a small quantity, α > 0 a large quantity
and T an iteration time. Typical values used in the simulations
are = 0.01, α = 4.25 and T = 10. We say that the decimation
condition is fulﬁlled if one of following occurs:
i) After some time τ ( ) < T , the messages do not change
signiﬁcantly in two successive iterations, in the sense that

ensemble with even l and Poisson degree for code-bit nodes, a
rigorous proof is presented in [9] where the spatially coupled
periodic XORSAT problem is discussed. Optimal distortions
for degree distributions (k, 2k), k = 3, 4 and 5 are given in
the ﬁrst line of Table I. We observe that, as k increases, the
optimal distortion converges to the rate-distortion bound Dsh .
This observation is consistent with the result in [12, 13].

A. Belief Propagation Approximation
The naive way to compute the partition function involves
the summation over 2nLl/r terms. Unfortunately, this approach
is too complex. The same problem occurs for computing the
marginal distribution of a node. On a tree, however, these
computations can be done exactly and yield the BP equations.
We deal with graphs that are locally tree-like and this motivates
the use of the BP equations as a ﬁrst approximation for
the marginals. These involve a set of 2 |E (Γ)| real valued
messages, each pair being associated to an edge. The messages
on the edge (i, a) ∈ C (Γ) × G (Γ) are denoted by ηi→a and
ηa→i , and satisfy


β
1
tanh (βηj→a )
ηa→i = tanh−1 (−1)xa tanh( )
β
2

It is not difﬁcult to see that the complexity of the algorithm is
O(n2 L2 ). Note that after each decimation, rather than resetting
messages to zero we continue with the previous messages.
An important element in the algorithm is that when there is
no signiﬁcant bias (step (4)) the random decimation occurs in
a speciﬁc bounded interval centered around L/2 and of size w.
We observe that this creates a seed from which the encoding
process starts propagating through the ring. The usual hard
decimation algorithms randomly choose (when there is no bias)
a code-bit from the whole graph. We observed that when this
prescription is used for CCLDGM instances, the distortion does
not improve with respect to that of usual LDGM instances.

As a side remark, note that as β → ∞ the BP equations
become the so-called Min-Sum equations. From the solutions
of equations (4) one can compute the BP marginal distributions
of code-bit i and generator node a, and a Bethe approximation
µBP (u|x) (this is not a probability measure in general) of
β
the original measure µβ (u|x). We refer to [19] for more
information.
Unfortunately, the number of solutions of the BP equations
which lead to roughly the same distortion, grows exponentially
large in terms of n, and one cannot ﬁnd the relevant ﬁxed point
by a plain iterative method. To resolve this problem, the BP
iterations are equipped with a heuristic decimation process.
This forms the basis of the BPGD algorithm.

C. Optimal β and Relation to BSC
We have seen that a conﬁguration u∗ maximizes the probability µβ (u) for all β > 0. If µBP was an accurate approxβ
imation of µβ , we would expect the maximum of µBP (u) to
β
be independent of β. But µBP is not an exact description of
β
µβ . It is then natural to look at the performance of the BPGD
procedure for different β and ﬁnd an optimal parameter βopt .
Figure 3 illustrates the performance of BPGD versus β for
CCLDGM(3, 6, 64, 3, 2000) and LDGM(3, 6, 128000) ensembles. For this example, the ﬁrst observation is that, for all
β > 0, the coupled ensemble has smaller DBPGD than the
uncoupled ensemble. We also observe that each ensemble has

an optimal parameter βopt which lies between 2 and 5 . In
2
order to make comparison between coupled and uncoupled
ensembles and as the distortion does not vary much when
3
β ∈ 2 , 5 , we ﬁx β = 2 in the rest of the paper. Table I
2
shows that the BPGD distortion - for the value β = 2 - is still
consistently higher than Dopt .
The measure µβ also arises in the context of channel coding
over a memoryless binary symmetric channel (BSC). Suppose
that we use the LDGM code with factor graph Γ over a BSC
with ﬂipping probability p. Then the posterior probability that
nl/r
the un-coded message u ∈ F2
is sent given the received
n
codeword x ∈ F2 can be formally expressed just as in (3)
with β → ln 1−p . The difference between channel coding
p
and lossy source coding lies in the distribution of X. In lossy
source coding, {Xa } are n i.i.d. Ber(1/2) variables; whereas
in channel coding over a BSC, they are not in general i.i.d.
and depend on the ﬂipping probability p (or β).

equal to DBPGD of the underlying ensemble and decreases to
a value that we call the saturation value. Then, in the range
[w, L ], the local distortions nearly remain constant and equal
2
to the saturation value. We refer to the ﬁrst interval and the
second interval respectively as the unsaturated part and the
saturated part. Therefore, the average distortion considerably
decreases in the coupled ensembles.
Tables II, III and IV show the saturation value (in bold)
and the average distortion (in parentheses) for k = 3, 4, 5 and
different values of n, L and w. Each value is averaged over 100
random code instances and random source words. Inspection
of the tables suggests that it approaches Dopt in the regime
n
L
w
1. The average distortion DBPGD converges
to the saturation value by increasing L. The reason is the
unsaturated part essentially does not change for ﬁxed k, w and
n (see Figure 4), thus its contribution in the average distortion
vanishes in the large L limit. As a result, we expect that DBPGD
gets very close to Dopt for a large enough n
L
w

and the optimal β. Moreover, if k grows, Dopt converges to the
rate-distortion bound. Thus, the DBPGD of a regular CCLDGM
ensemble can get close to the rate-distortion bound.
As mentioned before, the coupled chains used in channel
coding are terminated by suitable boundary conditions and this
incurs a rate loss of order O( w ). In CCLDGM ensembles, we
L
do not pay this cost in the graph structure, but it manifests

V. D ISTORTION S ATURATION IN A CCLDGM E NSEMBLE
We provide simulation results which convincingly show that
the BP distortion of a CCLDGM ensemble closely approaches
the optimal distortion of the underlying LDGM ensemble as
n, L and w grow large. To emphasize the effect of coupling,
we consider the family of (k, 2k)-regular LDGM ensembles.
This family is known to yield a weak performance under the
BPGD algorithm [12]. Indeed, although the optimal distortion
is rather close to the rate-distortion bound and improves as k
grows, the BPGD distortion becomes larger as k grows (see
Table I). Analogous behaviors are well known to occur in
channel coding [18].
Now consider a CCLDGM(k, 2k, L, w) ensemble. Let Dz
denote the average distortion of the reconstruction nodes lying
at position z. Call Dz the local distortion at position z. Thus,
L−1
1
the total average distortion is D = L z=0 Dz . Call the vector
(D0 , D1 , · · · , DL−1 ) the distortion proﬁle.
When we apply the BPGD algorithm, we observe a generic
behaviour in the distortion proﬁle. Figure 4 illustrates the
distortion proﬁle of CCLDGM(5, 10, L, w, n) ensembles for
different pairs of (L, w) and n = 2000 . The proﬁle is
symmetric around L (this expected in view of the algorithm).
2
Consider the ﬁrst L components. In the range [0, w − 1], the
2
local distortion is strictly decreasing. It starts at a value roughly

VI. C ONCLUSION
We have observed that CCLDGM(k, 2k, L, w) ensembles
can asymptotically saturate the rate-distortion bound under a
BPGD algorithm. Degrees (k, 2k) have been chosen because
it is known they lead to weaker results in the uncoupled
case, but the saturation presumably occurs for a large class of
irregular LDGM ensembles. As a result, using a right-regular
CCLDGM ensemble with Poisson distribution on the code-bit
nodes, would allow to achieve the rate-distortion bound for all
rates R ∈ (0, 1).
There are clearly a number of features of the algorithm that
can be improved. Two important issues are its convergence
rate, and its complexity. To address the ﬁrst one, we can ﬁx to
zero the code-bits lying in range [ (L−w) , L+w ] and then, we
2

remove the reconstruction nodes (and source nodes) lying in
ranges [0, w ] and [L − 1 − w , L − 1]. The total rate of the code
2
2
slightly increases but the convergence rate is improved. The
complexity of the BPGD algorithm used here is O(n2 L2 ). To
reduce it one could use a “sliding window encoding” similar to
the one used for coupled LDPC codes [3]. This would reduce
