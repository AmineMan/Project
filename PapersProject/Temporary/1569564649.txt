Abstract—Sequences with good correlation properties have
been widely used in modern communications, radar and sonar
applications. In this paper, we consider the autocorrelation property of the single binary and quaternary Golay sequences, with
special focus on their zero periodic autocorrelation zone. Some
examples along with one case of the proof will be given in order to
demonstrate this zero periodic autocorrelation zone. This ﬁnding
on Golay sequences can be explored during synchronization and
detection at the receiver end and thus improve the performance of
the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system
where Golay sequences are employed for the peak-to-average
power reduction.

In quasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QSCDMA) system, zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences can
be used to eliminate or reduce the multiple access interference
and multipath interference [9]. As a result, the construction of
new ZCZ sequences for QS-CDMA system has received much
researchers’s attention [1], [3], [6], [7], [8], [10], [11], [13],
[14], [19].
In this paper, we intend to consider the zero autocorrelation
zone of binary and quaternary GDJ Golay sequences.

Let H be a positive integer and ξ be the primitive H√
th root of unity, i.e., ξ = exp(2π −1/H). For a sequence
a = (a0 , a1 , · · · , aN −1 ) over ZH with period N , its aperiodic
autocorrelation function and periodic autocorrelation function
are respectively deﬁned by

I. I NTRODUCTION
In modern communications, sequences with good autocorrelation property are desired for receiver synchronization
and detection purposes. In 1961, Golay proposed the idea
of aperiodic complementary sequence pair [4], of which the
sum of out-of-phase aperiodic autocorrelation equals to zero.
Later on, Davis and Jedwab formulated a method for constructing such pairs using generalized boolean functions [2],
which are called GDJ Golay pairs. Because of this correlation
property, Golay complementary sequences have been utilized
to construct Hadamard matrix for DS CDMA system [12],
and to control the peak envelope power (PEP) in orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system [15], [16],
[17], [18].
The utilization of Golay sequences in the two above scenarios are based on the property of the sum of out-ofphase autocorrelation of the pair equals to zero. However,
synchronization and detection of the signal is equivalent to
computing its own autocorrelation. In this case, the autocorrelation of single sequence is of our interest. Our motivation
is to examine the property of Golay sequences when it is
being utilized in this scenario. More speciﬁcally, if single
Golay sequences inherit some ﬁxed, attractive autocorrelation
property which can be exploited during detection and thus
improve the performance of the system.

If the periodic autocorrelation function of a is equal to zero
with a range 0 < |u| ≤ L, where L is a positive integer, then
the sequence a has a zero autocorrelation zone of length 2L.
Let a and b be two sequences over ZH with period N . The
sequences a and b are called a Golay complementary pair if
Ca (u) + Cb (u) = 0 for any 1 ≤ u ≤ n − 1. Any one of them
is called a Golay sequence.
A generalized Boolean function f (x1 , · · · , xm ) with m
m
variables is a mapping from Z2 to Z2h , h ≥ 1, which has
an unique representation as a multiple polynomial over Z2h
of the special form:
f (x1 , · · · , xm ) =

aI Πi∈I xi , aI ∈ Z2h .
I∈{1,···,m}

This is called the algebraic normal form of f . The algebraic
degree is deﬁned by the maximum value of the size I with
aI = 0.

The set {i : 0 ≤ i < n} can be divided into four disjoint
subsets:

Let (i1 , · · · , im ) be the binary representation of the integer
m
m−k
i =
. A Boolean function f (x1 , · · · , xm ) can
k=1 ik 2
also be regarded as the output column of its truth table, i.e., a
binary string of length 2m , where the i-th element of the string
is equal to f (i1 , · · · , im ). For example, m = 3, we have
f

=

I1 (u)
I2 (u)
I3 (u)

Naturally, a generalized Boolean function can be regarded
as a sequence of length 2m over Z2h . In [2], by using the
quadratic generalized Boolean functions, Davis and Jedwab
constructed Golay complementary pairs as follows.
Theorem 1 (Theorem 3, [2]): Let m ≥ 2 be a positive
integer and n = 2m . Deﬁne a sequence a = (ai ) over Z2h of
length n

iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(2) = jπ(2) ,
iπ(m) = jπ(m)
iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(2) = jπ(2) ,
iπ(m) = jπ(m)

;
.

(iπ(2) 2m−2 + 2m−2 ) + 2m−2

= jπ(1) 2m−1 + jπ(2) 2m−2
≤ j
i.e., j > i + u. This is a contradiction.
(ii) In this case, one has i > iπ(1) 2m−1 = 2m−1 > j since
π(1) = 1, iπ(1) = 1 and jπ(1) = 0, i.e., j < i. This together
with j − i ≡ u(mod n) indicates that j = i + u − n. While
one also has
i+u <

(iπ(1) 2m−1 + iπ(2) 2m−2 + 2m−2 ) + 2m−2

= iπ(2) 2m−2 + 2m
= jπ(2) 2m−2 + 2m
≤ j+n

In the following, we will present a class of binary Golay
sequence with a zero autocorrelation zone of length 2m−1 .
Theorem 2: Using the same notation as Theorem 1, let π be
a permutation of {1, 2, · · · , m} with π(1) = 1 and π(2) = 2,
and h = 1. Then the binary sequence (ai ) given by (1) has
Ca (u) = 0 for any u ∈ U , where

i.e., j > i + u − n. This also contradicts with j = i + u − n.
By the discussion above, the set I4 (u) is an empty set. Then
the autocorrelation function Ra (u) given by (2) can be written
as
Ra (u)

U = {k : 1 ≤ k ≤ 2m−2 } ∪ {k : 3 · 2m−2 ≤ k ≤ 2m − 1}.

=

i∈I1 (u)

+

In other words, those sequences have a zero autocorrelation
zone 2m−1 .
Proof: Note that Ra (u) = Ra (n − u) for any u. So it is
sufﬁcient to prove

Ra (u) =

First we will show that the subset I4 (u) is an empty set. In
this case, iπ(1) = jπ(1) indicates that:
(i) iπ(1) = 0 and jπ(1) = 1; or
(ii) iπ(1) = 1 and jπ(1) = 0.
(i) In this case, one has j > jπ(1) 2m−1 = 2m−1 > i since
π(1) = 1, iπ(1) = 0 and jπ(1) = 1, i.e., j > i. This together
(1) with j − i ≡ u(mod n) indicates that j = i + u. While one
also has

where π is a permutation from {1, 2, · · · , m} to itself and
ci ∈ Z2h , i = 0, 1, · · · , m. Then the sequences ai and ai +
2h−1 iπ(1) + c are a Golay pair of length 2m for any c ∈ Z2h .
This paper is organized as follows. In Section III, we will
present a class of binary Golay sequence with a large zero
autocorrelation zone of length 2m−1 . In Section IV, we will
illustrate this zero autocorrelation zone with a few examples.
We will also extend the binary case into quaternary case, and
empirically show that the zero autocorrelation zone also exists
for quaternary Golay sequences.

and an integer i, set j = i+u( mod n) and let (i1 , i2 , · · · , im )
and (j1 , j2 , · · · , jm ) be the binary representations of i and j,

Let I3 (u) be the set corresponding to i ∈ I3 (u). Also using
the same argument as case i ∈ I1 (u), we get the following.
1) iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(2) = jπ(2) , iπ(m) = jπ(m) , and j −i ≡
j − i ≡ u(mod n).
2) I3 (u) = I3 (u);
3) (−1)ai −aj + (−1)ai −aj = 0.
Hence we have that equality (6) holds.
By equalities (4)-(6), Ra (u) given by (2) is equal to zero.

This equality indicates that (−1)ai −aj /(−1)ai −aj = −1, and
then
(−1)ai −aj + (−1)ai −aj = 0.
In this way, the two terms will cancel each other. Hence we
have i∈I1 (u) (−1)ai −aj = 0.

IV. E XAMPLES
In this section, we will give 6 examples and discuss their
zero autocorrelation zone. The ﬁrst 3 examples are binary
Golay sequences and the last 3 examples are quaternary Golay
sequences. For binary Golay sequence, h in (1) is equal to 1.
For quaternary Golay sequence, h in (1) is equal to 2.
Example 1: Let m = 5 and π be an identity permutation
from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to itself, (ck )5
k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The
sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1,
1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0). Then one
has (Ra (u))31 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, −12, 0, 4,
u=1
0, 4, 0, −12, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). It is easy to see
that the sequence a has a zero autocorrelation zone of 16. See
Figure 1.
Example 2: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that maps
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 1, 3, 5, 4), (ck )5
k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0).
The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0,
1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0).
Then one has (Ra (u))31 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, −8, 4,
u=1
0, −4, −8, −4, 0, −4, −8, −4, 0, 4, −8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
It is easy to see that the sequence a also has a zero
autocorrelation zone of 16. See Figure 2.
Example 3: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that
maps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 3, 4, 1, 5), (ck )5 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0).

The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0). Then one

Proof of Equality (5).
Let i ∈ I2 (u) = {0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 : iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(m) =
jπ(m) }. In this case, let i and j be the two integers with
binary representations deﬁned by
iπ(k) = 1 − jπ(k) , k = 1, · · · , m
and
jπ(k) = 1 − iπ(k) , k = 1, · · · , m.
Let I2 (u) be the set corresponding to i ∈ I2 (u). Using the
same argument as case i ∈ I1 (u), we can obtain the following.
1) iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(m) = jπ(m) , and j − i = j − i ≡
u(mod n).
2) I2 (u) = I2 (u);
3) (−1)ai −aj + (−1)ai −aj = 0.
Hence equality (5) holds.
Proof of Equality (6).
Let i ∈ I3 (u) = {0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 : iπ(1) = jπ(1) , iπ(2) =
jπ(2) , iπ(m) = jπ(m) }. In this case, let i and j be two integers
with binary representations deﬁned by
k=1

1 − jπ(k) ,

15

and

ai − aj − ai + aj = 1

jπ(k) ,

In other words, i and j are obtained from i and j
by “ﬂipping” the (v − 1)-th bit in (iπ(1) , · · · , iπ(m) ) and
(jπ(1) , · · · , jπ(m) ). It is easy to show that j − i = j − i ≡
u(mod n). Let I1 (u) be the set of the set of corresponding
i ∈ I1 (u). Note that the following fact holds.
1) i lies in the same range and also satisﬁes iπ(1) = jπ(1) .
2) The mapping from I1 (u) to I1 (u) is a one-to-one
mapping.
Hence we can conclude that I1 (u) = I1 (u).
Given i, j, i , j , we have

has (Ra (u))31 = (0, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −12, 0, 4, 0, 0,
u=1
0, 0, 0, 4, 0, −12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4, 0, −4, 0, 0). It is easy to see
that the sequence a has a zero autocorrelation zone of 4. See
Figure 3.
It can be observed that in the ﬁrst two cases of binary
Golay sequences, the autocorrelation of the ﬁrst quarter and
last quarter phase shift is exactly 0. This implies they have
a zero autocorrelation zone of length 2m−1 = 16. The
permutation for Example 1 falls within Theorem 2. However,
the permutation for Example 2 does not. The Example 3 does
not exhibit this relation.
In conclusion, there are more cases that also possess large
zero autocorrelation zone and which are not characterized by
Theorem 2. We will include a detailed discussion on those
cases in the full version of this work [5].
Example 4: Let m = 5 and π be an identity permutation
from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to itself, (ck )5
k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0). The
sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1,
1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2). Then one
has (Ra (u))31 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4j, 0, 4j, 0, 12j, 0, −4j,
u=1
0, 4j, 0, −12j, 0, −4j, 0, −4j, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), where j =

−1. It is easy to see that the sequence a has a zero
autocorrelation zone of 16. See Figure 4.
Example 5: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that maps
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 1, 3, 5, 4), (ck )5
k=0 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0).
The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1,

0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2). Then
one has (Ra (u))31 = (2j, 4j, 2j, 0, 2j, 4j, −6j, 0, −2j, −4j,
u=1
6j, 0, −2j, −4j, −2j, 0, 2j, 4j, 2j, 0, −6j, 4j, 2j, 0, 6j, −4j,
√
−2j, 0, −2j, −4j, −2j), where j = −1. It is easy to see
that the sequence a has no zero autocorrelation zone. See
Figure 5.
Example 6: Let m = 5 and π be a permutation that
maps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to (2, 3, 4, 1, 5), (ck )5 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0).
k=0
The sequence a given by (1) is a = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2). Then
one has (Ra (u))31 = (0, 0, 4, 0, 4 + 8j, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4 − 8j,
u=1
0, −4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −4, 0, −4+8j, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4−8j, 0, 4, 0, 0),
√
where j = −1. It is easy to see that the sequence a has a
zero autocorrelation zone of 4. See Figure 6.
Note that for the ﬁgures of quaternary Golay sequences,
autocorrelation Ra (u) is taken in the form of magnitude.
This is because autocorrelation of quaternary Golay sequences
contains both real part and imaginary part.
For quaternary Golay sequences, it can be observed that
even though the permutation and constants are exactly the
same as binary case, their autocorrelation distribution is somewhat different. The ﬁrst quaternary case still exhibits the zero
autocorrelation zone of length 2m−1 . This however, no longer
holds true for the second case. The third quaternary case,

V. C ONCLUSIONS AND D ISCUSSIONS
We have shown that there exists Golay sequences with
selected permutations and constants which will contain zero
autocorrelations zones of length 2m−1 for both binary and
quaternary cases. The binary case is proved theoretically, and
the quaternary case is demonstrated by experimental results.
Golay sequences with this property can have wide implications for synchronization and detection at the receiver end. If
the synchronization of system is guaranteed to occur within
the zero autocorrelation zone, then early synchronization or
late synchronization caused by multi path interference will
have no impact on the performance of the system. There will
only be a peak value at 0-th phase shift(i.e., correct timing
synchronization). Thus the synchronization of system can be
achieved.
As shown by experimental results in Section IV, there are
some other cases of binary Golay sequences with a large zero
autocorrelation zone, and some classes of quaternary Golay
sequences also exhibit this property. Further ﬁndings about
this property will be included in the full version of this work
[5]. We also ﬁnd large zero odd periodic correlation zone for
H-ary Golay sequences and 4q -QAM Golay sequences, which
will be introduced in a separate paper.
