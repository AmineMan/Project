is notoriously difﬁcult to be implemented in practice, due to
the nested lattice coding construction and lattice quantization
steps involved (See for example [3], [4]).
Motivated by Compute-and-Forward (CoF) [5] (or quantized
compute-and-forward (QCoF) [6]), we propose a novel coding
strategy named Reverse QCoF (RQCoF) for the DAS downlink
with ﬁnite backhaul link capacity R0 . In QCoF and RQCoF
the coding block length n can be arbitrarily large but the
shaping block length is restricted to 1 (scalar quantization [6]).
However, we would like to point out that the same approach
can be straightforwardly applied to CoF based schemes, where
also the shaping dimension becomes large (in this case, we
would refer to the scheme as Reverse CoF (RCoF)).

Abstract—We consider a distributed antenna system where L
antenna terminals (ATs) are connected to a Central Processor
(CP) via digital error-free links of ﬁnite capacity R0 , and serve
K user terminals (UTs). This system model has been widely
investigated both for the uplink and the downlink, which are
instances of the general multiple-access relay and broadcast
relay networks. In this work we focus on the downlink, and
propose a novel downlink precoding scheme nicknamed “Reverse
Quantized Compute and Forward”(RQCoF). For this scheme we
obtain achievable rates and compare with the state-of-the-art
available in the literature. We also provide simulation results
for a realistic network with fading with K > L UTs, and show
that channel-based user selection produces large beneﬁts and
essentially removes the problem of rank deﬁciency in the system
matrix.1

I. S YSTEM AND PROBLEM DEFINITION

A. Overview of QCoF

We consider a distributed antenna system (DAS) with K
user terminals (UTs) and L “antenna terminals” (ATs). All
UTs and ATs have a single antenna each. The ATs are connected with a central processor (CP) via wired links of ﬁxed
rate R0 . We study the downlink scenario, where the CP wishes
to deliver independent messages to the UTs. This is a simple
instance of a broadcast relay network, where the ATs operate
as relays. In this work we focus on the sum-rate and assume
that the CP and all UTs have perfect channel state information
(more general results are provided in [1]). If R0 → ∞, the
problem reduces to the well-known vector Gaussian broadcast
channel, the capacity region of which is achieved by Dirty
Paper Coding (DPC). However, for ﬁxed ﬁnite R0 , DPC and
other widely considered linear precoding schemes cannot be
applied in a straightforward manner. A simple DAS system,
the so-called Soft-Handoff model, was investigated in [2], by
introducing a “compressed” version of DPC (CDPC), where
the CP performs joint DPC under per-antenna power constraint
and then sends the compressed (or quantized) codewords
to the corresponding ATs via the wired links. While this
scheme is expected to be near-optimal for very large R0 , it is
generally suboptimal at ﬁnite (possibly small) R0 . Also, DPC

Let Zp = Z mod pZ denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld of size p, with
p a prime number, ⊕ denote addition over Zp , and g : Zp → R
be the natural mapping of the elements of Zp onto {0, 1, ..., p−
1} ⊂ R. For a lattice Λ, let QΛ (x) = argminλ∈Λ { x −
n
λ } denote the associated lattice quantizer, V = {x ∈ R :
QΛ (x) = 0} the Voronoi region and deﬁne [x] mod Λ = x−
QΛ (x). For κ ∈ R, consider the two nested one-dimensional
lattices Λs = {x = κpz : z ∈ Z} and Λc = {x = κz : z ∈
Z}, and deﬁne the constellation set S Λc ∩ Vs , where Vs
is the Voronoi region of Λs , i.e., the interval [−κp/2, κp/2).
The modulation mapping m : Zp → S is deﬁned by v =
m(u)
[κg(u)] mod Λs . The inverse function m−1 (·) is
referred to as the demodulation mapping, and it is given by
u = m−1 (v) g −1 ([v/κ] mod pZ) with v ∈ S.
Consider the (real-valued) K-user Gaussian multiple access
channel with inputs {x ,i : i = 1, ..., n} for = 1, ..., K,

at the transmitter, so that every UT obtains just its own desired
message. For simplicity of exposition, in this paper we restrict
to the case K = L and consider the real-valued channel
y = Hx + z deﬁned by the downlink (from ATs to UTs)
L×L
channel matrix H ∈ R
. Let aT denote the set of integer
coefﬁcients as in (3), obtained by the -th UT, deﬁne A to
be the matrix with rows aT , and let Q = [A] mod p denote
the downlink ”system matrix” over Zp . For the time being we
assume that Q is invertible over Zp , although they may be rank
deﬁcient since each UT chooses its own linear combination
coefﬁcients independently of the other nodes. The case of rank
deﬁciency will be handled later. Let z be the discrete additive
˜
noise (over Zp ) at the -th UT. The detailed description of
“reverse” QCoF (RQCoF) is as follows.
• For the given Q, the CP precodes the user information
k
messages {w ∈ Zp : = 1, ..., L} using the inverse
−1
system matrix Q . The precoded L-dimensional vectors
of information symbols to be transmitted by the ATs are
given by

where c ,i is the i-th symbol of c and d ,i ’s are i.i.d. dithering
symbols ∼ Uniform(Vs ), known at the receiver. The channel
inputs x ,i are uniformly distributed over Vs and have second
moment SNR E[|x ,i |2 ] = κ2 p2 /12. The receiver’s goal is
to recover a linear combination c =
q c of the transmitted
users’ codewords, for some coefﬁcients q ∈ Zp . For this
purpose, the receiver selects the integer coefﬁcients vector

This is obtained by minimizing with respect to signal scaling

QCoF is given by
RQCoF = log p − H(˜).

for i = 1, . . . , k.
The CP forwards each block µ = (µ ,1 , ..., µ ,k ) to the
-th AT, during n time slots, corresponding to the duration
of a codeword sent on the wireless channel. Therefore,
we have the rate constraint (k/n) log p ≤ R0 .
After receiving k symbols, the -th AT locally encodes
its information symbols µ using the same linear code C
over Zp (i.e., c = µ G), and produces its channel input
according to
x

Also, by [5, Th. 4], the achievable computation rate of CoF
is given by

We showed in [6] that, for ﬁxed large SNR

sufﬁciently large p (e.g., p ≥ 251), the (6) and (7) differ
approximately by the shaping gain, i.e., ≈ 0.25 bits per real
dimension.

for i = 1, . . . , n.

By [6, Th. 1], the -th UT can recover a noiseless linear
combination of ATs’ information symbols if R ≤ log p −
max {H(˜ )}. This is given by

Hence, the -th UT can successfully recover its desired
message.
The following sum-rate is achievable by RQCoF:

II. R EVERSE Q UANTIZED C OMPUTE - AND -F ORWARD
The main idea is that each UT decodes a linear combination
(over the ﬁnite ﬁeld) of the messages sent by the ATs using
QCoF. In short, we exchange the role of the ATs and UTs and
use QCoF in the reverse direction. However, decoding linear
combination of the information messages is useful only when
these combinations can be shared such that the individual
messages can be recovered, provided that the resulting system
of linear equations is invertible over Zp . Since the UTs do
not cooperate, sharing the decoded linear combinations is
impossible in the downlink. Nevertheless, thanks to algebraic
structure of QCoF (or CoF), the messages from the ATs can
be the precoded versions of the original information messages
and hence, using an appropriate invertible precoding over Zp
at the CP, the effect of the linear combination can be undone

RRQCoF = L × min{R0 , log p − max{H(˜ )}

for any full-rank matrix Q. Similarly, from (7), we can get an
achievable sum-rate of RCoF

RRCoF = L × min{R0 , min{RCoF (σε )}}

(10)

for any full-rank integer matrix A.
Remark 1: The rates in (9) and (10) can be improved using
the following particular code construction. Without loss of
generality, assume that R1 = k1 /n ≥ R2 = k2 /n ≥
· · · ≥ RL = kL /n. Let {w :
= 1, ..., L} be zeropadded messages to the common length k1 . Each zero-padded
message is encoded by the same generator matrix, forming the

2

codewords c = w G. Differently from the original RQCoF,
the CP precodes the codewords as:

but introduces a SNR penalty due to the non-unitary precoding
matrix B. Although not investigated further in this work, we
remark here that a more general scheme can be optimized
by trading off the precoder SNR penalty with the RQCoF
non-integer penalty, by imposing an approximated integer
forcing condition. Further, we extend IFBF to the case of
ﬁnite R0 by using quantization, as done in [2], where CP
forwards the quantized sequences to the ATs for which the
quantization noise is determined from standard rate-distortion
theory bounds. Assuming H invertible, the IFBF scheme is
L×L
given as follows. For a given A ∈ Z
(optimized later),
the CP uses the precoding matrix B = H−1 A and the system
matrix Q = [A] mod pZ.
Assuming that Q is full rank over Zp , the CP produces the
downlink streams x = {x ,i : i = 1, . . . , n}, for = 1, . . . , L
as follows.

(ν1,i , ..., νL,i )T = Q−1 (c1,i , ..., cL,i )T for i = 1, ..., n. (11)
Since (ν ,1 , ..., ν ,n ) ∈ C, the CP can forward the corresponding index (k log p bits per channel use) instead of codeword
itself (n log p bits per channel use), which is a kind of compression process. The -th UT can produce its demodulation
output as in (4):
qT (ν1,i , ..., νL,i )T ⊕ z ,i
˜

= qT Q−1 (c1,i , ..., cL,i )T ⊕ z ,i
˜
= c

,i

⊕ z ,i
˜

which shows that each user can have a point-to-point channel
over Zp , with additive noise z ,i . The achievable rate for UT
˜
with this scheme is given by min{R0 , log p − H(˜ )}.
z
Finally, the achievable rate of RQCoF is maximized by
minimizing the entropy H(˜ ) with respect to A subject to
z
the system matrix Q is invertible over Zp . Instead, we resort
to the suboptimal (but much simpler) problem of minimizing
the variance of effective noise in (5). That is, the UT ﬁnds
the a to minimize the quadratic form aT (SNR−1 I + h hT )a
L
with respect to a ∈ Z and a = 0. This problem was solved in
[6] using the LLL algorithm [7], possibly followed by Phost or
Schnorr-Euchner enumeration (see [8]) of the non-zero lattice
points in a sphere centered at the origin, with radius equal
to the shortest vector found by LLL. Notice that in this way
the UTs select their integer coefﬁcients independently, i.e.,
the full-rank condition is not enforced as a part of the noise
variance minimization.

The CP precodes the codewords {c ∈ Zp : = 1, ..., L}

Using the predeﬁned B, the CP produces the precoded channel
inputs {v ,i : i = 1, . . . , n} using
(v1,i , . . . , vL,i )T = B(x1,i , . . . , xL,i )T , for i = 1, . . . , n,
and forwards them to the ATs via the wired links. Consistently
with our system deﬁnition, we impose a per-antenna power
constraint equal to SNR (with suitable normalization). Then,
the second moment of x ,i is determined as

III. C OMPRESSED I NTEGER -F ORCING B EAMFORMING
In short, the idea underlying RQCoF is that each UT converts its own downlink channel into a discrete additive-noise
multiple access channel over Zp . Since each UT is interested
only in its own message, the CP can precode the messages
using zero-forcing linear precoding over Zp , at no transmit
power additional cost (unlike linear zero-forcing over R). It
is known that the performance of CoF (and therefore QCoF)
is quite sensitive to the channel coefﬁcients, due to the noninteger penalty, since the channel coefﬁcients are not exactly
matched to the integer coefﬁcients of linear combinations [5],
[6]. The same problem arises in RQCoF (or RCoF), due to
their formal equivalence. In [9], it was shown that integerforcing linear receiver (IFLR) can eliminate this penalty by
forcing the effective channel matrix to be integer. Here, we
propose a new beamforming strategy named Integer-Forcing
Beamforming (IFBF), that produces a similar effect for the
downlink.
We present the IFBF idea assuming R0 = ∞, as the dual
scheme of IFLR, and consider ﬁnite R0 later. In IFBF, the
precoding matrix B = [b1 , ..., bL ]T is chosen such that the
effective channel matrix HB is integer-valued. Then, RQCoF
can be applied as before, to the effective channel matrix HB,
incurring no non-integer penalty by construction. In short,
IFBF with RQCoF removes the non-integer penalty of RQCoF

which guarantees that the powers of the signal transmitted
from the ATs satisfy the power-constraint E[|v ,i |2 ] ≤ SNR

by
y

= aT x

Notice that thanks to the IFBF the non-integer penalty is equal
to zero. From (4), the demodulation output is given by

which shows a point-to-point channel over Zp . Finally, the
achievable rate of IFBF with RQCoF can be obtained by numerically computing the entropy of discrete additive noise over
Zp corresponding to effective noise ε ∼ N (0, max { b 2 })
(i.e., same for all UTs), where the impact of power constraint
is included in the effective noise. The following sum-rate is
achievable by IFBF with RQCoF:

IFBF with RCoF:
L
RIFBF = log(SNR/ max{ b 2 })
(13)
2
for any full-rank integer matrix A, where b ’s are determined
by A.
For the case of ﬁnite R0 , we propose a “compressed” IFBF
(CIFBF) where the CP forwards the quantized channel inputs
to the -th AT as follows. From the standard rate distortion
theory, we have
R(D )

|v

for any full-rank integer matrix A. Finally, the achievable
rate is maximized by minimizing the maximum powerenhancement by appropriately selecting an integer matrix A
subject to the full-rank constraint. This problem appears to
be a hard problem, and we chose A by minimizing the sum
power that can be handled by LLL instead. This approach is
veriﬁed to provide good performance for symmetric and nearsymmetric conﬁgurations (e.g., Wyner model in (16)). That is,
we ﬁnd the A solution of:

where γ ∈ [0, 1] represents the inter-cell interference level
and z ,i ∼ N (0, 1). Thanks to the dual-diagonal structure
of the channel matrix, the system matrix is guaranteed to
have rank L. An achievable rate of CDPC is equal to the
sum-capacity with per-antenna power constraint on the vector
broadcast channel with additional quantization noises. This is
computed by using an efﬁcient algorithm in [10]. In Fig. 1, it
is remarkable that RCoF can outperform other schemes when
R0 ≤ 3 bits per channel use. Furthermore, when γ = 1
(e.g., integer-channel matrix), RCoF achieves the cut-set upper
bound such as min{DPC with inﬁnite R0 , L × R0 }, showing
the better performance than other schemes. In particular when
R0 is sufﬁciently large, CIFBF performs within 0.5 bits per
user from CDPC (near-optimal for large R0 ) and appears to
offer a good performance-complexity tradeoff. Not surprisingly, RQCoF approaches the performance of RCoF within
the shaping loss of ≈ 0.25 bits/symbol, as already noticed in
the uplink case [6].
For RQCoF, there would be a concern on rank-deﬁciency of
system matrix Q in particular when p is small, since every UT

Using the fact that tr(AB) = tr(BA), the objective funcL

efﬁciently solved using the LLL [7] as follows. For a given

lattice Λ = {x = H−1 z : z ∈ Z }, a reduced basis of lattice
is obtained through a unimodular matrix U = [u1 , ..., uL ]
L
such that Λ = {x = H−1 Uz : z ∈ Z }, implying that
−1
F = H U generates the same lattice but has “reduced”
columns, i.e., the columns of F have small 2-norm. Since
U is a square integer matrix with full-rank, we can choose
the a = u . Moreover, we can ﬁnd the optimal A by using
Phost or Schnorr-Euchner enumeration (see [8]) to generate
the non-zero lattice points in a sphere centered at the origin,
with radius equal to max { H−1 u 2 } (that guarantees the
existence of desired solution) and using a greedy algorithm to
ﬁnd L shortest lattice points among them subject to full-rank
constraint (see [1] for more details).

selects its own linear combination coefﬁcients independently
of the other nodes. This problem can be essentially avoided
by scheduling, i.e., by selecting groups of users to be served
simultaneously such that the corresponding system matrix is
full rank. For example, consider a downlink DAS with L
ATs and K > L UTs. The scheduler aims at maximizing
the computation rate subject to the full rank condition, by
selecting a subset of L < L UTs. The q coefﬁcients (rows
of the matrix Q) are independently optimized by each UT
as explained before, and are provided to the CP. By Remark
1, we can compute an achievable user rate (i.e., R for
= 1, ..., K), which depends solely on the matrix Q and can
be pre-computed before the user selection. Notice that this
process can be done before performing scheduling algorithm.
Let Q(U) denote the submatrix of Q consisting of the rows
q with in the index set U. Then, the user selection problem
consists of ﬁnding the user subset U solution of:

assumed that if the resulting system matrix after user selection
is rank deﬁcient then the achieved sum-rate of all users is zero,
for that speciﬁc channel realization. As shown in Fig. 2, RCoF
suffers from rank-deﬁciency when using random selection,
although the rank of the resulting 5 × 5 channel matrix over R
is equal to 5 with probability 1. In high SNRs, user selection
can provide both multiuser diversity and greatly mitigate the
problem of rank deﬁciency, even for small p. This is indicated
by the fact that the gap from the RCoF is essentially equal to
the the shaping loss, as in the case where the full-rank system
matrix is guaranteed by assumption.

In the case of Rank(Q) < L, the sum-rate is equal to zero
since there is no way to serve L UTs simultaneously. Also,
if Rank(Q) = L, the problem (17)-(18) can be considered as
the maximization of linear function over matroid constraint
and Rado and Edmonds proved that a greedy algorithm ﬁnds
an optimal solution [11]. In brief, every step adds one UT to U
with maximum achievable rate subject to increasing the rank
of system matrix. This process is repeated until |U| = L.
