approach is shown in [13] to be optimal or approximately
optimal to communicate independent sources. Their results are
based on building channel codes on top of previously existing
joint source-channel codes and thus the distortion region (or
inner/outer bounds on it) is not found. In [4], on the other hand,
it is shown that separate source-channel coding is not optimal
for lossless transmission of correlated sources over a multiple
access channel (MAC). However, in [2], [1], the authors show
that performing separate source and channel coding for the
important case of a Gaussian MAC with unknown phase shifts
at the encoders is optimal for the lossless case. They have
also shown optimality of separation for the MAC in the lossy
coding context in the high ﬁdelity regime.
The recent work [8] addresses the lossless joint sourcechannel coding problem for a phase fading Gaussian multiple
access relay channel and proves a separation theorem under
some channel coefﬁcients. For the achievability part, the
authors use the results of [6], and [11], based on a combination
of Markov encoding at the encoders and backward decoding
at the receiver [5].
Herein, we consider the problem of sending a pair of
correlated Gaussian sources over a phase-fading Gaussian
interference relay channel which manifests both interference
and cooperation in wireless communications. The transmitters
encode the continuous sources and send them over the channel
while satisfying certain power constraints. We assume that the
phase shifts over channels under consideration are random but
ﬁxed over the block length. As a practical assumption, we
assume that the phases are not known to the transmitters and
the relay while the channel state information (CSI) is available
to decoders. We thus refer to the channel under consideration
as a phase incoherent interference relay channel (PI-IRC). At
the receivers, the sources are intended to be reconstructed
with the best possible minimum square error distortions. The
contributions of this work are as follows:

Abstract—We study the lossy communication of a bivariate
Gaussian source over an interference channel with the presence
of a helping relay. We assume that the wireless links introduce
random phase shifts which are unknown to the transmitters
(including the relay) and call the channel a phase incoherent
interference relay channel (PI-IRC). We derive inner and outer
bounds for the achievable distortion region, where the inner
bound is derived under speciﬁc strong interference conditions
as well as strong gain conditions between transmitters and the
relay. When the sources are correlated, we ﬁnd an approximate
achievable distortion region in the high SNR regime. In case
of independent sources, the bounds are tight and by explicitly
providing the achievable distortion region, we show that a separation theorem results for the PI-IRC under strong interference
conditions. By removing the relay, the result also specializes to
an interference channel.

I. I NTRODUCTION
An inherent challenge to modern communication systems
is the issue of incoherence or asynchronism between different
nodes of a communication network. In particular, time or
phase asynchronism in wireless channels due to factors such
as feedback delay, the bursty nature of some applications,
and reaction delay, make the design of precoders/encoders
much more difﬁcult [12]. Moreover, in wireless multi-user
systems, interference and relaying from other sources can
make synchronization a more complex problem.
In point-to-point wireless systems, achieving receiver synchronization is possible in principle, using training sequences
and/or feedback. However, the assumption of full receivertransmitter synchronization, although analytically convenient,
is rarely practical and it is in some cases theoretically infeasible [16]. In highly mobile environments, for instance, fading
in conjunction with feedback delay may result in out of date
phase knowledge by the time it reaches the transmitters.
Channel uncertainty, i.e., the situations in which the communicating parties (or some of them) have to work without
the full knowledge of the law governing the channel [7],
is a suitable framework to analytically study the issue of
phase asynchronism. Also, in order to study informationtheoretical aspects of this problem, the mathematical model
of a compound channel has been proposed by various authors
[3], [15]. A compound channel is generally represented by a
family of transition probabilities pθ |X , where the index θ is
Y
the state of the channel and is chosen from a set Θ that models
the uncertainty.
In this paper, we are interested in joint source-channel
coding for phase asynchronous wireless networks involving
essential elements of wireless communications, i.e, interference and cooperation. The problem of ﬁnding the optimal
solution for lossless/lossy joint source-channel coding over an
arbitrary communication network is open in general. For lossy
source-channel coding over interference networks, a separation

We ﬁrst ﬁnd a rectangular outer bound to the distortion
region which is represented by constraints on D1 and D2 .
Under speciﬁc strong interference gain conditions, and
under the extra condition of strong gains from transmitters to the relay, we ﬁnd an inner bound to the distortion
region represented by constraints on D1 , D2 , and D1 D2 .
For a ﬁxed correlation coefﬁcient between the sources,
we show that in the high SNR regime, the constraints
on D1 and D2 of the inner bound coincide with those
of the outer bound whereas the third constraint of the
inner bound shrinks a portion of the achievable distortion
1
region proportional to 1−ρ2 where ρ is the correlation
coefﬁcient.
In the case of independent sources (again under strong
interference conditions), we show that the inner bound
exactly matches the outer bound and consequently fully
characterize the achievable distortion region. Namely,
we ﬁnd the optimal distortion region and determine the
optimality of separate source and channel coding for the

phase incoherent case, as opposed to cases where the
transmitters have knowledge of the phase shifts and could
potentially achieve higher rates using beamforming, for
example.
• Similar inner and outer bounds can be found for an interference channel with an arbitrary number of relays under
phase asynchronism. Our results can also be specialized
to an interference channel by omitting the relay, i.e., an
inner and outer bound to the distortion region as well as
the optimal joint source channel coding distortion region
for independent sources are also found. For the case of
no relay (interference channel), the results hold for both
phase coherent and incoherent scenarios.
Although we assume non-ergodic phase shifts throughout
the paper, as in [1], [6, Thm. 2], our results also apply to the
case where the phases change i.i.d. from symbol to symbol.
Also, in this paper, we focus on the strong interference regime,
leaving other interference conditions as considerable future
works.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we present the preliminaries along with a key lemma. Next, the
outer bound and the inner bound on the achievable distortion
region are described and proved in Section III. In Section
IV, we state specializations of our results to the high SNR
regime, independent sources and interference channel. Finally
we conclude the paper in Section V.

channel

where ρ ∈ [−1, 1]. Both of the sources are to be transmitted to
the corresponding destinations through a continuous alphabet
and discrete-time memoryless non-ergodic Gaussian interference relay channel. The setup is shown in Fig. 1. The channel
is parameterized by the phase shifts that are introduced by
different paths of the network and are, as a realistic assumption
for wireless networks, not known to the transmitters. The
vector θ denotes the phase fading parameters. Encoders wish
to use codes that are robust for all θ. In our model, the receiver
is fully aware of θ. For simplicity, throughout the paper, we
assume that transmitter node with index i ∈ {1, 2, r} has
power constraint Pi and the noise power at all corresponding
receiving nodes is N .
Such a channel is referred to as a compound channel
[3], [15]. Nevertheless, in order to avoid ambiguity, we call
the particular channel under consideration a phase-incoherent
interference relay channel (PI-IRC).
As shown in Fig. 1, the PI-IRC (X1 × X2 × Xr , Y1 × Y2 ×

and by the strong interference conditions (11) and (12), the
constraints (23)-(25) are satisﬁed and we are guaranteed to
have reliable decodings of both the ﬁrst and second channel
encoders codewords. Furthermore, by replacing R1 , R2 , as
chosen in (26) and (27), in (19), one obtains the achievable
distortion region given by (16)-(18).
Remark 1: A similar outer bound and inner bound can
be derived for a phase incoherent interference channel with
multiple relays.
Remark 2: Note that if there are no relays in the network,
for deriving the outer bound in Section III-A, Lemma 1 is not
needed since there is only one phase in (5) then. Therefore,
as opposed to the case of an interference relay channel, for
an interference channel, the results carry on to the scenario
in which the encoders are aware of the phase shifts as well.
Namely, by removing relay dependant terms and redeﬁning A
and B in (3) and (4), Theorem 1 applies to a general Gaussian
interference channel. Theorem 2 can also be specialized to an
interference channel with equations (11), (12) replaced by very
strong interference conditions

Proof: To establish the achievability argument, we follow
a separate source-channel coding scheme based on lossy
distributed source coding and reliable channel coding for the
PI-IRC where both of the receivers are forced to estimate
both of the sources with respective distortions D1 , D2 . The
source coding indices and channel coding rates are denoted
by ω1i , ω2i , and R1 , R2 respectively.
Source Coding: An inner region Rin (D1 , D2 ) on the rate
region R(D1 , D2 ) of distributed source coding of two Gaussian sources for a common decoder is given in [9], [14]. The
inner region can be reexpressed as the following achievable
distortion region

Channel Coding: Using block Markov coding in conjunction
with backward decoding at the receivers and forward decoding
at the relay, as shown in Table I, we can derive the following
sufﬁcient conditions to reliably decode all messages at both
decoders for a compound IRC [10]:

C. Approximate inner bound
In the moderate to high SNR regime, i.e., when the noise
power N is relatively small, the second terms in the right
hand sides of (16)-(18) will be negligible compared to the
ﬁrst terms. The inner bound can thus be approximately (or
exactly in the limit) described by {D1 ≥ A, D2 ≥ B, D1 D2 ≥
AB
1−ρ2 }. Therefore, the constraints on D1 and D2 coincide in
both the inner region and outer region. The third constraint
on D1 D2 makes the inner region restricted by a curve and
results in a ρ-dependant gap between the regions. This can
be inferred as approximate optimality of separation for values
of the correlation coefﬁcient that have small magnitude. A
typical example is depicted in Fig. 2, where the approximate
inner bound practically matches the actual inner bound. We
also see that for ρ = 0, the regions exactly coincide for all
SNR regimes.

V. CONLUSION
We have derived a general outer bound on the distortion
region, for sending a bivariate Gaussian source over an IRC
under phase uncertainty at the transmitters. Using a separation
approach, we then derived an inner bound for the distortion
region under speciﬁc SNR-dependant gain conditions which
mainly represent strong interferences between the transmitters
and the unwanted receivers. Next, an approximation to the
inner bound in the high SNR regime was found. Under the
speciﬁed gain conditions and phase uncertainty at transmitters,
we consequently characterized the achievable distortion region
for independent sources and proved a separation theorem. By
removing the relay, our results were specialized to communication of independent Gaussians over an interference channel
with SNR-dependant strong interference gains.

IV. O PTIMAL D ISTORTION R EGIONS
For the special case of ρ = 0, the inner bound of Theorem
2 will coincide with the outer bound given in Theorem 1.
Therefore, we can fully characterize the optimal distortion
regions for the case of independent Gaussians and state the
following separation theorem as a corollary.
Corollary 1: Provided the gain conditions (11)-(15) are
met, the set of all achievable distortion pairs (D1 , D2 ) for
a PI-IRC with ρ = 0 is given by
D1 ≥
D2 ≥

1
[1 +

2
(g11 P1

2,

2
+ gr1 Pr )/N ]
1

2.

2
2
[1 + (g22 P1 + gr2 Pr )/N ]

Furthermore, in order to achieve this distortion region, it is
sufﬁcient to perform lossy source coding and channel coding
separately.
A similar corollary can be stated for an interference channel:
Corollary 2: Provided the gain conditions (28), and (29)
are met, the set of all achievable distortion pairs (D1 , D2 ) for
an interference channel, with a pair of independent Gaussian
sources, is given by
D1 ≥

1

[1 +

2,
2
g11 P1 /N ]

D2 ≥

1

[1 +

2.
2
g22 P1 /N ]

Furthermore, in order to achieve this distortion region, it is
enough to perform lossy source coding and channel coding
separately.
