Abstract—We study the secret message capacity of an ergodic
block fading wiretap channel with partial channel state information at the transmitter and perfect channel state information
at the receivers. We consider that in addition to the statistics of
the main and the eavesdropper channel state information (CSI),
the sender is provided by the legitimate receiver with a q-bit
feedback, at the beginning of each coherence block, through an
error-free feedback channel, with capacity q bits. We establish
upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity. We show that
a positive secrecy rate is achievable even when the feedback is
at the end of each coherence block and q = 1. We also show
that the lower and the upper bounds coincide asymptotically
as q → ∞. Finally, asymptotic analysis at high Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (SNR) are presented where it is found that the capacity
is bounded at high-SNR and present a simple suboptimal scalar
quantizer that is capacity achieving, without the need of any
numerical optimization, as q → ∞. When applied to Rayleigh
fading channels, we show that, at high-SNR, a 4-bit feedback
achieves 90% of the secrecy capacity when perfect main CSI is
available at the transmitter.

I. Introduction
The role of fading in providing physical layer security has
been extensively highlighted recently, e.g. [1], [2]. In this
context, we consider a wiretap channel consisting of a sender
(Alice), a legitimate receiver (Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve).
Alice wants to communicate a secret message to Bob while
keeping Eve in full ignorance of such a message. The main
channel, between Alice and Bob, and the eavesdropper channel, between Alice and Eve, are both block fading channels.
For inﬁnitely large coherence blocks and assuming that we can
code over an inﬁnite number of such coherence blocks and if
the sender is perfectly aware of either the main channel state
information (CSI) or both the main and the eavesdropper CSI,
the secrecy capacity has been derived in [3]. Should the main
CSI be imperfect at the sender, the secrecy capacity is still
not known in general. In [4], a lower and an upper bounds
on the secrecy capacity are derived for a class of independent
identically distributed (i.i.d.) fast fading channels, when the
codeword length spans many coherence periods and when the

Engineering Research Council (Canada) and an Early Researcher Award from

sender has imperfect main CSI. Schemes based on sending an
artiﬁcial noise to enhance the eavesdropper equivocation [5],
even when the sender has imperfect CSI, are presented in, e.g.,
[6], [7]. The secrecy capacity has also been studied using the
so-called variational distance as a secrecy criterion in [8].
In this paper, we assume that Bob knows its own channel
instantaneously and Eve knows both its own channel and the
main channel, instantaneously; whereas Alice is only aware
of the statistics of these channels. There is also an error-free
feedback channel with limited capacity from Bob to Alice that
may be tracked by Eve. The secret message capacity of this
channel is not known. Several previous works have highlighted
the impact of limited-rate feedback on the capacity of fading
channels without secrecy constraint (see for instance, [9] and
references therein). However, to the best of our knowledge,
not much attention has been given to secret message capacity
with limited-rate feedback. For the setting described above,
we extend the scheme in [3] to incorporate q-bit feedback
and observe numerically that when Rayleigh fading channels
are considered, a 4-bit feedback achieves 90% of the high
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) secrecy capacity when perfect
main CSI is available at the transmitter. We also show that
even when the feedback is at the end of each coherence
block and q = 1, a positive secrecy rate is achievable. This
complements a result in [10] where a secret-key generation
mechanism with 1-bit feedback at the end of the coherence
block is proposed. As q → ∞, we prove that the achievable
rate coincides with the secrecy capacity when perfect main
channel CSI is available at the transmitter. Finally, we present
asymptotic analysis at high-SNR and show that the capacity
is bounded and that a simple suboptimal scheme which does
not require any numerical optimization, is capacity-achieving,
as q → ∞.
The organization of this paper is a s follows. Section
II describes the system model. Achievable rates with q-bit
feedback at the beginning of each coherence block or 1-bit
at the end of each coherence block are provided in Section
III. High-SNR analysis are reported in Section IV. Section V
contains our numerical results, whereas Section VI concludes
the paper.

II. System Model
We consider a discrete-time memoryless wire-tap channel
consisting of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper. Each terminal is equipped with a single antenna, i.e., a
single-input single-output single-eavesdropper (SISOSE) case.
The jth outputs at both the legitimate destination and the
eavesdropper, at time coherence period i, i = 1, . . . , L, are
expressed, respectively by:

y(i, j) = h(i) x(i, j) + v(i, j)



z(i, j) = g(i) x(i, j) + w(i, j),

E[|x(i, j)|2 ] ≤ Pavg .
We are interested in message transmission secrecy capacity
of such a channel when both L and m are inﬁnitely large.
Our secrecy criterion is based on the equivocation rate at the
eavesdropper as described in the Appendix.
III. Ergodic Capacity
In this section, our main result is presented in Theorem 1
the proof of which is relegated to the Appendix.

where j = 1, . . . , m, with m representing the number of symbols in each coherence block; x(i, j) ∈ is the jth transmitted
symbol at time coherence i, h(i) ∈ and g(i) ∈ are zeromean and unit-variance channel gains that represent the main
channel and the eavesdropper channel at time coherence i,
and w(i, j) ∈
are zero-mean,
respectively; and v(i, j) ∈
unite-variance circularly symmetric white Gaussian noises.
The channel gains h and g are assumed to be independent
identically distributed (albeit not necessarily), ergodic and
stationary with bounded and continuous probability density
functions (PDF). We assume perfect CSI at the receiver
sides. That is, the legitimate receiver knows the instantaneous
channel realizations h(i), whereas the eavesdropper is aware
of both h(i) and g(i). Throughout, we will use bold fonts to
represent random variables and standard fonts to represent the
realizations.
The transmitter is not aware of the channel realization g(i).
However, in addition to the statistics of both channels, the
transmitter is provided a q-bit (q integer and q ≥ 1) feedback
at the beginning (or at the end) of each coherence block,
through an error-free feedback channel with limited capacity
that is available to Alice and tracked by Eve. The result of
this feedback drives Alice’s decision to either transmit with
the highest ﬁxed rate Rk , k = 1, . . . , N, where N = 2q − 1, such
that Rk < log 1 + |h(i)|2 ∗ P if such Rk exists, or to remain
idle otherwise. Finally, the source is constrained according to
an average power constraint:

Pr Rk ≤ log 1 + |h|2 P < Rk+1

1 + |h|2 P (h)

as N → ∞.
Proof: The proof is given in the Appendix.
It is particularly appealing to see that the lower bound in (2) is
the sum over all possible rates of the product of the probability
of success times the average rates gleaned by Bob over Eve
during all fading realizations. A similar fact has been observed
in [10], but for secret key sharing (not message transmission)
and for N = 1. Theorem 1 states that a 1-bit feedback at
the beginning of each coherence block guarantees a positive
secrecy rate. Clearly, such a feedback mechanism converts the
main channel to a noiseless channel whereas the eavesdropper
is still suﬀering an erasure. The lower bound in (2) is an
increasing function of N and as shown in the Appendix, the
lower and the upper bounds in (2) match as N → ∞, hence
fully characterizing the ergodic capacity in this case. Letting N
goes to ∞ may be interpreted as if there is a noiseless feedback
link with inﬁnite capacity for which the secrecy-key capacity,
an upper bound on the secrecy capacity, is given by the right
hand side (RHS) of (2) [11], [12]. It is worth mentioning
that guaranteeing a positive secrecy rate is not really tied to
knowing the feedback at the beginning of each coherence
block. Providing a feedback at the end of each coherence
block instead, also guarantees a positive secrecy rate, although
smaller than the one given by (2). To see this, let us assume
that at the end of each coherence block, Bob feeds back a
1-bit ARQ to Alice informing her whether the actual frame
has been correctly decoded (ACK), or not (NACK). Alice
keeps retransmitting the same block until he gets an ACK,
then moves on to the next frame. Clearly, because some of the
frames are transmitted more than once, this scheme leaks some
information to the eavesdropper. Ultimately, one can assume
that the blocks repeated because of the NACK feedback are
completely revealed to the eavesdropper as a worst-case scenario. Fortunately, even such a not-very sophisticated scheme
guarantees a positive secrecy rate as formalized in Theorem
2.
Theorem 2: A lower bound on the secrecy capacity of the
discrete-time memoryless channel described by (1), with an
error-free 1-bit ARQ feedback at the end of each coherence
1 Our proposed rate can be immediately improved by allocating a diﬀerent
power for each k. However such gains are insigniﬁcant in the high SNR
regime, which is the focus of this paper.

The upper bound in (3) still holds.
Proof: Due to space constraint, we only outline the proof
of the achievability here2 . The achievability scheme is similar
to that of Theorem 1, with the diﬀerence that because the
sender keeps repeating the blocks that are NACKed until she
receives an ACK, these repetitions leak additional information
to the eavesdropper. Again the Random Coding Theorem
ensures that there exists a Gaussian codebook of rate R such
that the fraction of successfully decoded frames is given by:
Pr(success) = 1 − Pr R > log 1 + |h|2 P .

(5)

For the secrecy analysis, one can upper bound the equivocation
rate as follows:
n Re = H W|Z n , H L , G L , S L
≥ I W; X n |Z n , H L , G L , S L

and we are interested in the secrecy capacity at asymptotically
high-SNR. Our result is summarized in Corollary 1.

capacity C ∞ is given by:

where Lnr is the number of blocks that have not been repeated
and where (f) follows because the eavesdropper does not gain
any information about X m Lnr by observing the remaining L−Lnr
blocks since the blocks are independents and the channel is
memoryless. The second term on the RHS of (6) can be made
arbitrary small using a list decoding argument similarly to
nr
the Appendix. Finally, when Lnr → ∞, the ratio LL can be
computed as follows:

i=1

= Pr blocks i and (i − 1) not repeated, ∀i ≥ 2
= Pr(success)2 ,
(8)
where ½i is an indicator function that is equal to one if the
block i is not repeated and is equal to zero otherwise. Using
the ergodicity of the channel in (6) along with (7), (4) follows
immediately.
IV. Asymptotic Analysis

the beginning of each coherence, i.e., the settings of Theorem 1

Proof: The asymptotic achievable rate follows by adapting the rates R p ’s in Theorem 1 with the average power
constraint, i.e., R p = log 1 + α p Pavg . This set of rates is an
eligible candidate provided that 0 ≤ α1 ≤ . . . ≤ αN . Such a

Taking the limits on both sides of (11) as Pavg → ∞ and
using (12), the lower bound in (9) is established. To show that
the upper and the lower bounds coincide as N → ∞, it is
suﬃcient to choose α p ’s such that F|h|2 α p+1 − F|h|2 α p =

a given N, this might not be the best strategy that maximizes
the rate in (2) even at high-SNR. However, as N → ∞,
Corollary 1 states that one cannot do better. Letting N goes to
∞ may seem too restrictive as our feedback link is of limitedcapacity. Fortunately, this asymptotic behavior starts showing
up for relatively small N values as shown by our numerical
results, i.e., it takes only few feedback bits to achieve most
of the available secrecy capacity, at least in a Rayleigh fading
scenario.

Corollary 1.

V. Numerical Results
In this section, numerical results are provided for Rayleigh
fading channels such that E |h|2 = E |g|2 = 1. Figure 1
|h|2

|g|2

depicts the lower and the upper bounds in Theorem 1 in nats
per channel use (npcu) versus Pavg (designated here as S NR),
for diﬀerent q-bit feedback scenarios. Also shown in Fig. 1 is
the achievable rate in Theorem 2 with 1-bit ARQ feedback.
Figure 1 conﬁrms the positive secrecy rate even for 1-bit
feedback (at the beginning or at the end of each coherence
block). As the number of feedback bits increases (here q = 4),
the lower bound gets closer to the upper bound conﬁrming the
statement in Theorem 1 and more than 90% of the upper bound
is achieved at high-SNR values (above 15 dB) as displayed in
Fig. 1. Although the gap between the upper bound and the the
achievable rate slightly increases as SNR decreases, one can
still obtain more than 70% of the upper bound between 0 and
15 dB, with q = 4.
In Fig. 2, we set R p = log 1 + α p Pavg , p =
N
1, . . . , N, and set α p = log N−p+1 such that the condition
1
F|h|2 α p+1 − F|h|2 α p = N is satisﬁed, and we call the rate
achieved by this strategy as R sub−opt , for convenience. As can
be seen in Fig. 2, while this particular choice is not maximizing
the achievable secrecy rate for a given N, it gets arbitrary close
to the maximum achievable rate as N increases. For N large
enough (here q = 7 and N = 127), this suboptimal strategy
tends to coincide with the upper bound at high-SNR, hence
fully characterizes the secrecy capacity, in full agreement with

VI. Conclusion
The secret message capacity of an ergodic block fading
wiretap channels with limited-rate feedback has been addressed. lower and upper bounds have been derived when
an arbitrary number of feedback bits at the beginning of
each coherence block are provided to the sender by the
legitimate receiver, through an error free feedback channel
with limited capacity. We also show that a positive secrecy
rate is achievable when only 1-bit ARQ feedback is given
to the sender at the end of each coherence block. When the
number of feedback bits is large enough, the lower and the
upper bounds coincide, thus fully characterizing the capacity
in this case. A suboptimal strategy that adapts the rate with the
power constraint is presented and is shown to be optimal at
high-SNR, as the number of feedback bits tends to inﬁnity. Our
framework characterizes the value of limited-rate feedback on
secret message capacity.

We assume that the choice of rates {0 = R0 ≤ R1 ≤
R2 , . . . ≤ RN } are selected in advance. Let ∆ p = Pr(R p ≤
log(1+P|h|2 ) < R p+1 ) for p = 0, . . . , N−1. We establish that the
rate R s = N−1 ∆ p E[R p − log(1 + |g|2 P)]+ + ǫ is achievable. We
p=0
also let R0 = N−1 ∆ p R p − 2ǫ. We uniformly partition the set
p=0
of all 2nR0 sequences of length nR0 into 2nR s bins so that there
are 2n(R0 −R s ) sequences per bin. Each message W ∈ [1, 2nRs ]
corresponds to one bin-index. To transmit a message W the
transmitter selects the corresponding bin index and then select
a binary sequence v uniformly at random from all of the
sequences in that bin. Since all messages are equally likely
note that we induce a uniform distribution across all of 2nR0
sequences. In each length m coherence block, we transmit the
next m · R p information bits using a Gaussian codebook. We
let the transmit codeword in coherence block i be X(i) and the
received sequences at the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper
by Y(i) and Z(i) respectively. By weak law of large numbers,
when L ≫ 1 coherence periods are used for transmission, the
entire binary sequence v is transmitted with high probability.
Since in each block R p ≤ log(1 + |h|2 P) holds, the receiver can
decode the sequence v with high probability.
For the secrecy analysis, we observe that from our construction the codeword sequence X(1), X(2), . . . X(L) is independent
and hence
L

H(X n |Z n , hL , gL ) =

H(X(i)|Z(i), hi, gi )

(14)

i=1

Furthermore from the analysis of a Gaussian wiretap code

5

we have that
H(X(i)|Z(i), hi, gi ) ≥ [Ri − log(1 + |gi |2 P) − ǫ]+

(15)

where Ri ∈ {0, R1 , . . . , RN−1 } is the rate selected in coherence
block i.
Thus we have
nRe = H(W|Z n , hL , gL )

(16)

≥ I(W; X n |Z n , hL , gL )

(17)

= H(X n |Z n , hL , gL ) − H(X n |Z n , hL , gL , W)

(18)

L

[Ri − log(1 + |gi |2 P)]+ − H(X n |Z n , hL , gL , W) (19)

≥
i=1

Using weak-law of large numbers it can be seen that

Thus it only remains to show that the second term satisﬁes
H(X n |Z n , hL , gL , W) ≤ nǫ. We argue that given the message
W the eavesdropper can uniquely decode the sequence v and
hence the codeword sequence X n . In coherence block i, the
eavesdropper constructs a list Li for all codeword sequences
that are jointly typical with the received sequence Z(i). From
i
2
standard typicality analysis there are a total of 2m(R −log(1+|gi | P))
such sequences. It then searches for a unique sequence in the
set L = L1 × L2 · × · LL that belongs to the bin-index of
L
i

+
W. The size of this set is: |L| = 2m i=1 m[R −log(1+|gi | P)] , which
n(R s −ǫ)
from the weak-law of large numbers, approaches 2
as
L → ∞. Since each sequence in the set L belongs to the bin
of W with probability 2−nR s the overall error probability can
be shown to vanish as n → ∞.
For the upper bound, we simply reveal the main channel
state to Alice at the beginning of each coherence block
corresponds to conveying an inﬁnite-bit feedback by Bob. In
this case, the upper bound follows from the secrecy capacity
with main channel CSI established in [3, Theorem 2]. It
remains to show that the lower and the upper bounds coincide
as N → ∞. For this purpose, let the R p ’s scale with SNR as
R p = log 1 + α p P . By this speciﬁc choice, the achievable
rate becomes:

F|h|2 α p+1 − F|h|2 α p
as long as Alice is aware of the statistics of h which she is.
The results follows as N → ∞ due to the ergodicity.
