Abstract—In this paper, for an integer k, we evaluate an upper
bound for the cross-correlation of a ternary m-sequence of period
N = 34k+2 − 1 and its decimated sequence with decimation
4k+2
−32k+1 +2
d= 3
+ 32k+1 . It is found that the cross-correlation
4
is upper bounded by 4.5 · 32k+1 + 1.
Index Terms—cross-correlation, decimation, exponential sum,
m-sequence, quadratic form

of them have the lowest rank.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we present preliminaries and notations. In Section
III, we investigate the upper bound for the cross-correlation
magnitude. Some discussion and a conjecture on the crosscorrelation value is proposed in Section IV. Finally, concluding
remarks are given in Section V.

I. I NTRODUCTION

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Trace Functions and Cross-Correlation Functions
Let p be a prime and n be an integer. Let Fpn be the ﬁnite
ﬁeld with pn elements. The trace function trn : Fpn → Fp is
1
deﬁned as

The cross-correlation between p-ary m-sequences and their
decimated sequences by d has been extensively studied by
many researchers. Trachtenberg [1] investigated the crossk
+2
correlation for the decimation d = p 2 and d = p2k − pk + 1
when p is an odd prime. Helleseth [2] summarized many
known results and evaluated cross-correlation distributions for
various values of decimations. Muller [3] proved that for odd
n, the cross-correlation between a teranry m-sequence and its
√
n
n
+1
−1
decimation by d = 33+1 + 3 2 is upper bounded by 2 pn .
Hu et al. [4] generalized Muller’s result to p = 3 mod 4,
and Xia, Zeng, and Hu [5] have evaluated the correlation
distribution. More recently, Ness and Helleseth, Kholosha
[6] derived the distribution of the cross-correlation values
k
+1
for p = 3, d = 3 2 , where k is an odd integer with
gcd(k, n) = 1. For an odd prime p, even n, and d = pk + 1
with gcd(n, k) = 1, Seo, Kim, No, and Shin [7] estimated
√
the upper bound 1 + p pn . Choi, Lim, No, and Chung [8]
investigated cross-correlation values for an odd prime p and
m
2
decimation d = (p +1) , where m is odd. For a more detailed
2(p+1)
overview on this subject, we refer the reader to [9].
In this paper, for an integer k, we derived an upper bound
for the cross-correlation of a ternary m-sequence of period
4k+2
−32k+1 +2
34k+2 −1 and its decimation with d = 3
+32k+1 .

It is shown that the upper bound is given as 4.5·32k+1 +1. For
the derivation, we use the quadratic form theory as in [3]-[8],
but in this case four quadratic forms are involved. To obtain
possible rank combinations of quadratic forms, Bluher’s result
[10], [11] is employed. It is shown that quadratic forms have
only even ranks and among four quadratic forms, at most one

A p-ary m sequence s(t) is deﬁned to be
s(t) = trn (αt )

where α is a primitive element of Fpn . Let ω be a p-th root
of unity in the complex ﬁeld C and a(t), b(t) be sequences
over Fp of period N . Then the cross-correlation function C(τ )
between a(t) and b(t) at time shift τ is deﬁned as
N −1

ω a(t)−b(t+τ ) .

C(τ ) =
t=0

B. Quadratic Forms and Linearized Polynomials
A quadratic character η(x) of Fpn is deﬁned as

 1,
if x is a nonzero square in Fpn

η(x) = −1,
if x is a nonzero nonsquare in Fpn


0,
if x = 0.
A quadratic form over Fp with n indeterminates x1 ,
x2 , ... , xn is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in
Fpn [x1 , x2 , ..., xn ], which can be expressed as
n

aij xi xj

f (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) =
i,j=1

1

where aij ∈ Fp . The matrix A = (aij ) is called a coefﬁcient
matrix of f , and det(f ) = ∆ is deﬁned to be det(A). If the
rank of A is k for some 0 ≤ k ≤ n, then we say that the rank
of f is also k. If rank(f ) = n, f is said to be nondegenerate.
For a nondegenerate quadratic form f over Fp , one can
calculate the number of solutions of f (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) = b for
b ∈ Fp by the following lemma.

with coefﬁcients in Fqm is called a linearized polynomial over
Fqm . For an extension ﬁeld F of Fqm , we have

Lemma 1: [12] Let η be the quadratic character of Fp . The
number of solutions N (b) of f (x1 , x2 , ..., xn ) = b in Fn , when
p
f is a nondegenerate quadratic form in rank n with determinant
∆ and b ∈ Fp , is given as follows:

L(x + y) = L(x) + L(y), for all x, y ∈ F
L(cx) = cL(x), for all x ∈ F and c ∈ Fq .
Thus the set of roots of a linearized polynomial is a vector
space over Fq and the number of roots is a power of q.

Lemma 5: [10] Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of charateristic p and
c ∈ F ∗ . Suppose q is a power of p and F ∩ Fq = FQ . Deﬁne
f (x) = xq+1 − cx + c. Then the following are equivalent.
1) f has at least three roots in F ;
2) f has exactly Q + 1 roots in F ;
3) f has at least two roots in F and NF/FQ (r − 1) = 1 for
all root r in F .

if b = 0

By setting F = Fp4k+2 , q = p2k in Lemma 5, we have the
following result.

From Lemma 1, the following lemma is easily derived.
Lemma 2: [6] Let η be the quadratic character of F3 . Let
f be a nondegenerate quadratic form in n variables with
determinant ∆ and ω be the 3rd root of unity. Then

Corollary 6: Let k be an integer, n = 4k + 2, and p be an
2k
odd prime. Then Fpn ∩Fp2k = Fp2 . Let f (x) = xp +1 −cx+c,
c ∈ F∗n . Then the following are equivalent.
p
1) f has exactly p2 + 1 roots in Fpn ;
2) f has at least two roots in Fpn and

a primitive elements of F3n . Let N = 3n − 1 be the period
m
of m-sequence in F3n . Then gcd(N, d) = 3 4+1 . Set 0 ≤ l <
N/gcd(N, d) = 4(3m + 1). We consider the cross-correlation
function C(τ ) between trn (αt ) and trn (αdt+l ) with time shift

τ . Then C(τ ) is given as

For the case of rank(f ) = k < n, we can obtain the
number of solutions by multiplying the result of Lemma 1 or
Lemma 2 by pn−k . The rank of the quadratic form can be
determined by the following lemma.

where γ = αdτ +l and ω is a third primitive root of unity. Let

Or equivalently, among four polynomials hi (y) = y 3
ci y + ci , 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, at most one polynomial can have 10
solutions.
Proof: Without loss of generality, we may assume that ai = αi .
By the previous lemma, we have the following relation

Lemma 7: The number of roots of the linearized polynomial fi (z), i = 0, 1, 2 or 3, is one of 1, 9, and 81.
Proof: We have the following equalities

Next we show that among the four linearized polynomials
fi (z), 0 ≤ i ≤ 3, at most one polynomial can have 81 roots.

Let fi (z) = ai 3 z 3 + ai z 3
− (γad )3 z 3 − γad z 3 . By
i
i
the discussion above, it is sufﬁcient to count the number of
roots of linearized polynomial fi (z). Now we prove that the
number of roots of the linearized polynomial fi (z) is one of
1, 9, and 81. Note that the linearized polynomial fi (z) has
the degree 3n−1 , which is not constant, but depends on n.

Then by Lemma 4, the number of solutions of

y3
− ci y + ci = 0 is one of 0, 1, 2, and
(m−1,n)
3
+ 1 = 32 + 1 = 10. Since the mapping is 81 map, the number of solutions is one among 0, 8, 16, and
80. Adding a zero root (z = 0), we have 1, 9, 17, and 81.
Since the original equation is a linearized polynomial, 17
cannot be a number of root. Thus the linearized polynomial
can have only 1, 9, and 81 roots.

To derive the upper bound of the absolute values of the crosscorrelation, it is standard to obtain the rank of the quadratic
forms and apply Lemma 1. By Lemma 3, investigating the
rank of gi (y) can be done by counting the number of z such
that gi (y + z) − gi (y) = 0 for all y ∈ F3n . Simplifying the
equation gi (y + z) − gi (y) = 0 gives us

Suppose β = α 3m −1 = α3 +1 is a primitive element

of the subﬁeld F3m . Since a3 +1 = (αi )3 +1 = β i , for
i
m
i = 0, 2, a3 +1 is a square in the subﬁeld, and for i = 1, 3,
i
3m
ai +1 is a nonsquare element of the subﬁeld. The numerator
m−1
+1
(trn (γad ))3
is always a square in the subﬁeld F3m .
m
i
Consequently, ci is a square in the subﬁeld if i = 0, 2, and a
nonsquare if i = 1, 3. We claim that only f0 (z) can have 81
roots. Suppose fi (z) has 81 roots. First assume that i = 0 or
i = 2. By Corollary 6, we have

(n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 2), (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4).
For each of these rank combinations, we can derive the upper
bound of the cross-correlation values using Lemma 2. We will
check only for the last case, (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4). Using
Lemma 2, it follows that

Therefore y

C0 . We already observed that y ∈ C0 . Therefore we must have
ai ∈ C0 . This implies that i = 0. Now assume that i = 1 or
i = 3. This means that ci is a nonsquare in F3n . Thus, we can
write ci = β 2k+1 = (α4l )2k+1 = α8lk+4l . Note that l is odd
since m is odd. Applying Corollary 6 again, we have (3), but
for this case, it follows that

where 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , are determined to be 1 or −1 according to
the rank and determinant of the quadratic forms. Thus in this
case, the magnitude of the cross-correlation function C(τ ) is
upper bounded by 4.5 · 3m + 1. It is easily checked that among
all the rank combinations above, (n − 2, n − 2, n − 2, n − 4)
yields the largest upper bound for C(τ ). Therefore, we have
the following theorem.

Therefore, l is odd. Thus y ∈ C2 . From (2), we have
ai ∈ C2 . This implies that ci is in C2 , which contradicts
i = 1 or i = 3. Therefore if fi (z) has 81 roots, then i = 0.

Note that the cross-correlation is 7-valued. The similar result
is obtained for n = 10. Based on these, we propose the
following conjecture on the cross-correlation distribution.

It is well known that the number of roots of the linearized
polynomial fi (z) is equal to 3n−rank(gi (y)) . Therefore by what
we have dicussed so far, each gi (y) has a rank of n, n − 2, or
n − 4, and only one of gi (y) can have the rank n − 4 for i =
0, 1, 2, 3. Thus we can enumrate 9 possible rank combinations
of gi (y), i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ignoring order as

The main difﬁculty of the problem originates from two
factors. First, since there are more than two quadratic forms
involved, we have to exclude more candidate values for the
cross-correlation. In computer search, we found that every
rank combination in (5) actually appear. Thus we have to rule
out some combinations of i values, so that some exponential
sums in (6) cancel out each other. One typical technique to
do this is to set gi (y) = rgj (y) for some nonsquare r so that
det(gi ) = rk det(gj ), where k is a rank of gi and gj . If k is
odd, we can conclude that i = − j as we wish to show. But
in our case, all ranks of quadratic forms are even. This is the
second factor which makes the problem difﬁcult.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigate the upper bound for the
crosscorrelation function between a ternary m-sequence of
period n = 4k + 2 and its decimated sequence with the
4k+2
−32k+1 +2
+ 32k+1 . It is shown that the
decimation d = 3
4
cross-correlation is upper bounded by 4.5 · 3n/2 + 1. For the
derivation, it is proved that 1, 9, 81 are only possible number
of solutions of linearized polynomials and only one among
four linearized polynomials can have 81 roots. A conjecture
on the exact cross-correlation value is proposed as an open
problem.
