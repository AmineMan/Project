Many streaming applications involve playback. We thus
choose to look at the playback delay, which takes this into
account and reﬂects the end-to-end performance, rather than
the more common decoding delay metric. While in audio
and video applications some packets can be dropped without
affecting the streaming quality, other applications have strict
order constraints on the playback of packets. Our deﬁnition
of playback delay is suitable for these applications. This
deﬁnition was previously used in [5].
The delay performance of greedy codes has not been analyzed and compared to other codes. This work aims to ﬁll that
gap, and in particular consider the playback delay. We show
that expected playback delay grows proportionally to log n for
time index n. Thus, the key parameter in understanding the
asymptotic behavior of delay is the proportionality constant,
or pre-log. We ﬁnd the optimal constant within a family of
schemes that we call time-invariant, and conjecture that this
is the optimum for any scheme. This optimum is attained by
the conceptually simple coded repetition scheme.
Further, we show that even with instantaneous feedback, the
playback delay has similar logarithmic growth, although with
a smaller pre-log term. We evaluate that constant, and prove
that feedback strictly helps reduce the growth of delay, though
the gain vanishes in the limit of inﬁnite bandwidth.
The paper is organized as follows. We describe the system
model in Section II and introduce some preliminary concepts
in Section III. In Section IV we analyze streaming without
feedback and ﬁnd the optimal pre-log term in the growth of
playback delay. In Section V we ﬁnd the pre-log term for
streaming with instantaneous feedback and compare it with
the no-feedback case. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper
and presents future research directions.

Abstract—We consider the problem of minimizing playback
delay in streaming over a packet erasure channel with ﬁxed
bandwidth. When packets have to be played in order, the expected
delay inherently grows with time. We analyze two cases, namely
no feedback and instantaneous feedback. We ﬁnd that in both
cases the delay grows logarithmically with the time elapsed since
the start of transmission, and we evaluate the growth constant,
i.e. the pre-log term, as a function of the transmission bandwidth
(relative to the source bandwidth). The growth constant with
feedback is strictly better that the one without, but they have
the same asymptotic value in the limit of inﬁnite bandwidth.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In recent years there has been a widespread proliferation of
streaming applications. Unlike traditional ﬁle transfer where
only total delay matters, streaming imposes delay constraints
on each individual packet.
In the presence of lossless instantaneous feedback, the task
of transmission is simple: Automatic-repeat-request (ARQ)
protocols where the encoder only retransmits lost packets are
optimal under any delay metric. However, when feedback is
lossy, delayed or completely absent, more efﬁcient erasurecorrecting codes are needed. This is because the encoder has
inherent uncertainty about the state of the decoder, and it
must strike a balance between transmitting new packets and
repeating old packets that could have been erased.
Only a few papers in literature have analyzed streaming codes. Fountain codes [1] are capacity-achieving erasure
codes, but they are not suitable for streaming because the
decoding delay is proportional to the size of the data. Delayoptimal codes without feedback for adversarial and cyclic burst
erasure channels have been extensively explored in [2]. The
thesis also proposed universal codes for more general erasure
models and analyzes their decoding delay. These codes are
based upon sending linear combinations of source packets;
indeed, it can be shown that there is no loss in restricting
the codes to be linear. This reduces the task of the coding
scheme to deciding which packets should be included in every
combination. The universal codes proposed in [2] are greedy
codes where all packets generated so far are included in a
combination. Greedy codes have also been proposed for other
applications: in [3] for packet networks, and in [4] for a
broadcast scenario with perfect feedback.

We consider a point-to-point packet streaming scenario
where the source generates one packet pn in every time slot n.
The encoder creates b coded packets yn,i = f (p1 , p2 ..pn ),
for 1 ≤ i ≤ b in each slot, where we assume that b is an
integer1 . The channel is i.i.d erasure for every batch of b
packets. With probability ρ, all b coded packets are correctly
received, otherwise all are erased. We assume ρb > 1 to ensure
that the rate of packet generation is less than channel capacity.

1 Since we are interested only in the asymptotic behavior of playback delay,
the main results of this paper also hold for non-integer values of b.

The receiver plays one packet per slot in exact order. Any
packet decoded out of order is buffered until all past packets
are received and played. We assume that a packet decoded in
slot n is available for playback from slot n + 1 onwards. We
choose playback delay Pn , the time between the generation
and playback of packet pn as the metric of streaming quality.
III. P RELIMINARY CONCEPTS

Time Slots

A. Advantage of Coding

Fig. 2: Illustration of renewals for the coded repetition scheme.
Each number n in the packets transmitted denotes a linear
combination of all packets p1 through pn . The cross marks
denote erased slots and tick marks denote successful slots.

For the given system model, a simple repetition strategy is
to transmit packet pn in slots n, n + 1, .. n + b − 1. However,
if these b slots are erased, pn is lost permanently and the
playback ceases with probability 1. To avoid this, we can
n
transmit a linear combination yn = j=1 cj pj of packets p1
to pn , instead of packet pn by itself. The coefﬁcients cj ∈ Fq
and cj = 0 for all j. For large enough ﬁeld size q, there exist
coefﬁcients such that all linear combinations transmitted are
independent. Although we consider yn as a linear combination
here, it can be a general function f (p1 , p2 , ..pn ). Coding
offers the advantage that if yn is received when pn has been
already decoded, it can be used to decode previous packets.
We refer to this scheme as the coded repetition scheme. The
coded repetition scheme is a special case of a general class of
schemes which can be deﬁned as,

Deﬁnition 2 (Renewal). A renewal is deﬁned as the earliest
time n when all packets pj , 1 ≤ j ≤ n have been decoded.
The time between the (i−1)th and ith renewal is deﬁned as
inter-renewal time Ri , where we assume that the 0th renewal
occurs at time zero. It is easy to show that inter-renewal times
are i.i.d. Note that some packets can be decoded between
renewal instants. But at least one packet remains undecoded
until a renewal occurs.
In the special case of the coded repetition scheme, decoding
occurs only at renewal instants. Fig. 2 illustrates renewals
of the coded repetition scheme for b = 2. The plot at the
bottom of the ﬁgure shows the trajectory of the number of
undecoded combinations received with time. A renewal takes
place every time the trajectory hits the slope one line. For the
coded repetition scheme, the playback delay satisﬁes

Deﬁnition 1 (Time-invariant scheme). A time-invariant
scheme with pattern a = [a1 a2 .. ab ] is the coding strategy
where the source transmits combinations yn−ai , for 1 ≤ i ≤ b
in slot n, where ai > 0, ai < aj for all i < j, and yn is a
linear combination of packets p1 to pn .
The coded repetition scheme corresponds to pattern ai =
i − 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ b. Fig. 1 shows a typical timeinvariant scheme. A number k in the ﬁgure denotes the linear
k
combination yk =
j=1 cj pj , with cj = 0 for all j. The
constraint ai < aj for all i < j ensures that each pattern
a gives a unique scheme. If for some i, ai = ai+1 , setting
ai+1 = ai + 1 gives an equivalent scheme.

Pn = max(R1 , R2 , ..RJ ),

(1)

J

where J is smallest integer such that j=1 Rj ≥ n. There is
an interruption in playback when the new inter-renewal time
is longer than the current maximum.
The term information debt introduced in [2] is closely
related to renewals. Information debt is the amount of more
information needed for successful decoding. A renewal occurs
when the information debt becomes non-positive.

B. Renewals in Packet Decoding
The receiver is able to decode all packets up to the current
time when the number of combinations received exceeds the
number of packets generated. After this instant, the decoding
of future packets is independent of the past, and the system
behaves as if it was reset. This phenomenon gives rise to the
following deﬁnition of renewals in packet decoding.

IV. S TREAMING WITHOUT FEEDBACK
First, we consider the case where the encoder has no
feedback about channel erasures. We show that for all timeinvariant schemes the expected playback delay is asymptotically 1/λ ·log n where we refer to λ as the growth constant. The

2

coded repetition scheme achieves the largest growth constant
λ = λc where we deﬁne λc
D(1/b||ρ). In this deﬁnition,
D(p||q) is the binary information divergence function which
is deﬁned for probabilities 0 < p, q < 1 as,
D(p||q) = p log

Since we are interested in the long term evolution of
playback delay Pn , it is useful to look at the behavior of the
distribution Pr(R = n) for large n.

repetition scheme, the tail distribution of inter-renewal time R

where in (10) we use the result given in [7] that the expectation
of the maximum of J geometric random variables with decay

rate λc is 1/λc · i=1 1/i, which is asymptotically equal to
log J. By the strong law of renewal processes [8], we know
that J grows linearly with n. Thus, the expectation over J of
(10) replaces J by n and adds an O(1) term to give the upper
bound (3).
Similarly, we derive the lower bound (4) by deﬁning another
geometric random variable H with decay rate λc + (n) and
shifted g(n) units to the left of 0. The functions g(n) and (n)
are chosen such that for all m,

probability ρ and 0 with probability 1 − ρ. Let Sn be the
number of equations received until time n. Deﬁne the event

is no renewal until slot n − 1. The Generalized Ballot theorem

The converse part of Theorem 1 is a corollary of the
following lemma.

Conjecture 1. No scheme can achieve a larger value of
growth constant λ than λc for the coded repetition scheme.

Lemma 4 (Performance of any time-invariant scheme). For
any time-invariant scheme with pattern a as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1, the expected playback delay E[Pn ] satisﬁes

where in K is the smallest integer such that i=1 Ra,i ≥ n.
We then obtain (12) by using analysis similar to the proof
of Lemma 1, but applied to renewals of the genie-assisted
scheme.
Thus, we have shown that the coded repetition scheme gives
largest growth constant λ among all time-invariant schemes.
We have the following conjecture about time-varying schemes.

By the strong law of renewal processes and taking the expectation over J we get the lower bound (4).

E[Pn ] ≥

We believe this is true because in absence of feedback, the
statistics of undecoded packets are asymptotically stationary.
Although the playback delay is not stationary, it is a function
of the undecoded packets. Thus, using a time-varying scheme
cannot improve the playback delay performance.

(12)

where λa ≤ λc for all a.

V. S TREAMING WITH I NSTANTANEOUS F EEDBACK

To simplify the analysis of playback delay, we deﬁne a
genie-assisted version for every time-invariant scheme. In
the genie-assisted scheme, a renewal occurs whenever the
ﬁrst packet in that interval is decoded. Fig. 3 illustrates the
difference between the time-invariant scheme with pattern
a = [0 2] and its genie-assisted version.
Let Ra be inter-renewal time of the genie-assisted scheme
∗
with pattern a. Then, the playback delay after n slots Pn =
max(Ra,1 , Ra,2 ..Ra,K ) where K is the smallest integer
K
such that
i=1 Ra,i ≥ n. Let λa be the decay rate of its
tail distribution as deﬁned in Lemma 3. We can prove the
following result,

Now consider that the source receives instantaneous feedback about past erasures and thus can adapt its transmission
strategy. For this model, we determine λ, the growth constant
of playback delay, as a function of bandwidth b and channel
success probability ρ.
A. Streaming ARQ scheme

It is clear that a simple ARQ-based scheme as shown in
Figure 4 is optimal for streaming with instantaneous feedback.
In every slot, the source transmits the b minimum-index
packets that have not been decoded yet. If less than b packets
Lemma 5 (Asymptotic decay rate for time-invariant schemes). remain to be sent, the source transmits all of them.
The dynamics of the source and receiver buffers can be

with pattern a is such that, λa ≤ λc for all a.
in every slot one packet enters the source queue. In every slot
Proof: We lower bound the tail distribution of Ra by
b packets depart from the queue with probability ρ and 0 with
probability 1 − ρ. The departures from the source queue enter
Pr(Ra > n) ≥ (1 − ρ)ab +1 Pr(Ra > n|slots [1, ab + 1] erased),

playback delay with time index n is 1/λ · log n. We derived the
largest value of λ as a function of b and ρ for the no-feedback
and instantaneous feedback cases.
For streaming without feedback, the proposed coded repetition scheme achieves λ = D(1/b||ρ). With instantaneous
feedback, a simple ARQ based scheme achieves λ = log(1/α)
where α is the real positive root of (15). The behavior of
λ with bandwidth b is illustrated in Fig. 5. As b approaches
inﬁnity, both schemes converge to log(1/1−ρ). However the
instantaneous feedback converges at a much faster rate. The
achievable growth rate λ with delayed feedback will lie in the
region between the two curves in Fig. 5.
Finding the optimal scheme with delayed feedback is a part
of ongoing work. Another research direction is to consider
a broadcast streaming setup and investigate the trade-off
between delay and the number of users served by the source.
Although we assumed strict playback in this paper, the
proposed coding scheme can be extended to allow packet
dropping to reduce playback delay. Interested readers can refer
to [9] for details.

generating function of X. For the binary random variable X

where K is the smallest integer such that
Rk ≥ n. The
random variables Ik are i.i.d. since each belongs to a different
renewal interval. We now determine the asymptotic decay rate
of Pr(I > t) as deﬁned by Lemma 3 and use it to ﬁnd E[Pn ].
We can model the system by a random walk Sn = X1 +
X2 +..Xn where Xi ’s are i.i.d. binary random variables which
are b − 1 with probability 1 − ρ and −1 with probability 1 − ρ.
Sn is the difference between the number of packets decoded
at receiver and number of packets generated at source until
time n. Since ρb > 1 this random walk has a positive drift.
Consider two thresholds 0 and −t such that the random walk
stops permanently when it crosses any one of them. A renewal
corresponds to crossing threshold 0. The tail distribution
Pr(I > t) = Pr ( n {Sn < −t}), the probability that the
random walk crosses −t before crossing 0. The Kingman
bound [8] is an asymptotically tight bound on this probability
for random walk Sn = X1 + X2 + ..Xn . It states that,

Proof: Deﬁne a renewal as the instant when the source
queue is empty, and Rk as the k th inter-renewal time. Assume
that the system resets to its initial state with both queues empty
when a renewal takes place. Let Ik be the number of packets
remaining in the playback queue at the k th renewal instant. For
the ﬁrst renewal, I1 is equal to the number of interrupted slots
in that interval. For the k th renewal interval, an interruption
will occur only if Ik is greater than Ii for all 1 ≤ i < k. Thus,
the playback delay Pn of packet pn is
Pn = max(I1 , I2 , I3 , .. IK )

Replacing α = er we get (15). Thus, the tail distribution
Pr(I > t) decays with rate λ = log(1/α). We ﬁnd the bounds
(3) and (4) by taking an expectation of (16) and applying
the strong law of renewal processes, as done in the proof of
Lemma 1.

In this paper we analyzed the playback delay for streaming
over an erasure channel with bandwidth b and erasure probability 1−ρ. We showed that the dominant term in the growth of
