that inﬁnitely many nodes contribute to the interference.
Application of the TC: As already mentioned, the TC applies
only to stationary networks. When the node distribution is nonstationary, this metric must be modiﬁed to take into account
heterogeneous node deployments.
In reality, wireless ad hoc networks always exhibit a heterogeneous node distribution. The most obvious example is
perhaps when the nodes are distributed in a bounded region.
In such a network, the interference situation near the center
will signiﬁcantly differ from that at the border. Besides this
simple example, more complex deployments are often found
in practice, e.g., wireless sensor networks created by airdrop
[3], spontaneous formation of hot spots [4], etc.

Abstract—We study the interference and outage statistics in a
slotted Aloha ad hoc network, where the spatial distribution of
nodes is non-stationary and isotropic. In such a network, outage
probability and local throughput depend on both the particular
location in the network and the shape of the spatial distribution.
We derive in closed-form certain distributional properties of the
interference that are important for analyzing wireless networks
as a function of the location and the spatial shape. Our results
focus on path loss exponents 2 and 4, the former case not
being analyzable before due to the stationarity assumption of the
spatial node distribution. We propose two metrics for measuring
local throughput in non-stationary networks and discuss how our
ﬁndings can be applied to both analysis and optimization.

A. Contribution

The application of stochastic geometry to the modeling and
analysis of wireless networks has attained a lot of attention
in recent years. It has enabled a new framework called
transmission capacity (TC) framework, which led to many new
profound results in the topic of wireless networks (cf. [1], [2]).
The advantage of using a spatial model to describe the node
positions rather than assuming a deterministic network topology is two-fold: First, such a probabilistic approach decouples
the performance analysis from the actual topology, thereby increasing the generality of results. Second, it provides powerful
means for network optimization, especially for highly dynamic
networks, where interference is (unpredictably) fast-varying.
With few exceptions, the node positions are mostly modeled
as a stationary point process. Stationarity is a desirable property, allowing analytically tractable computations and, even
more important, representing a key requirement for applying
the deﬁnition of TC. Even though the stationarity assumption
has not really narrowed the range of obtainable insights, it
poses some shortcomings to the analysis of wireless networks:
Inﬁnite networks: Stationarity implies that the network is
inﬁnitely large as opposed to real deployments with a ﬁnite
number of nodes.
No border effects: Border effects are inherently neglected in
inﬁnite networks. However, border effects cause heterogeneity
in the nodes’ capabilities depending on their location, i.e.,
being dis-/connected, interference-/noise-limited, etc.
Inﬁnite interference for free-space path loss: For stationary
node distributions in the plane and a path loss exponent α = 2,
the interference is inﬁnite almost sure (a.s.) [1], resulting in
a TC of zero. More speciﬁcally, stationary models lose their
accuracy as the path loss exponent decreases due to the fact

We extend the existing framework by relaxing the requirements on the node distribution, thereby allowing for isotropy
only. More speciﬁcally, we have the following results:
•

•

The interference and outage statistics for slotted Aloha
with α = 2 and α = 4 are derived as a function of
the receiver position and the spatial shape of the node
distribution. We consider a path loss plus block fading
model. As for the outage statistics, we focus on Rayleigh
fading. We show how known results for the stationary
case arise from our results as special cases.
Two global metrics, namely the differential TC and the
average sum throughput, that take into account heterogeneous node deployments are proposed. While the former
metric is a reﬁnement of the TC, the latter quantiﬁes the
ﬁrst order overall network efﬁciency.

B. Related work
Stationary models with heterogeneous node deployment
have already been investigated. Speciﬁcally, Poisson-Cluster
[5] and Mat´ rn hard-core models [6] have been studied, as
e
they are well-suited for analyzing more sophisticated medium
access control (MAC) schemes. Treated as general motioninvariant, these and similar models were further analyzed in
[2], [7], [8] in a unifying way. In [9], a non-stationary and
isotropic node distribution was assumed for analyzing multiantenna receivers. While the analysis showed that the shape
of the spatial distribution has a considerable impact on link
performance, the scenario was limited only to the case of the
receiver located in the origin.

II. N ETWORK MODEL
We consider a wireless ad hoc network with nodes isotropically distributed in R2 . The MAC employed by the nodes is
slotted Aloha. In a randomly chosen slot, some nodes wish to
transmit a packet. We assume that the set of transmitters {x}
follows an isotropic Poisson point process (PPP) Φt := {x}
on R2 with intensity λ(x), where x ∈ R2 . Due to the isotropy
of Φt , λ(x) is rotation-invariant and depends only on the
Euclidean norm x , i.e., λ(x) = λ( x ejφ ) = λ( x ),
φ ∈ [0, 2π). When working with polar coordinates, we
will use the notation λ(r), where r := x . With [6], we
can describe λ(r) as the resulting intensity after distancedependent thinning of a stationary PPP of intensity λ, i.e.,
λ(r) := λF (r),

III. I NTERFERENCE ANALYSIS
We now study the interference statistics at the reference
receiver at y0 . Before, we note the following two integral
identities which are taken from [10]:

We are now in the position to derive the ﬁrst moment of
the interference at y0 .

Theorem 1. Let f (r) := dF (r)/dr, c > 0 and α = 2. If
lim F (r)rν < ∞ for some ν > 0, then
r→∞

E!x0 [I(y0 )] = λA2 (y0 , c) < ∞,

what follows from Campbell’s Theorem and Slivnyak’s Theorem [11], and from the i.i.d. property of gxy0 . Applying
Identity 1 and 2 yields the result.
The function A2 (y0 , c) in (8) has an interesting interpretation: A2 (y0 , c) can be described as the interference ﬁeld associated with the origin o, from which the remaining interference
adds up differentially.
Corollary 1. Summary of some special cases of Theorem 1:
1) When we assume F (0) = 1 and f (r) ≤ 0 for all r ∈ R+ ,
F (r) can be interpreted as a complementary cumulative
distribution function (CDF) with respect to a random
distance r to the origin, yielding

i.e., the outage event is a steep function of the SINR. The

where Pn (x) is the nth -Legendre polynomial.

where F (r) is called the shape function as it reﬂects the spatial
shape of Φt . We will pose the following restrictions on F (r):
(i) Positiveness: F (r) ≥ 0 for all r ≥ 0.
(ii) Normalization: maxr {F (r)} = 1.
The restrictions (i) and (ii) are necessary to ensure that λ(r)
is non-negative and bounded by λ everywhere.
We assume that each transmitter x has an intended receiver
y randomly located at ﬁxed distance d. From the random
translation Theorem [6] it follows that the set of receivers {y}
forms an isotropic PPP Φr := {y} on R2 with intensity λ(x)
as well. The ﬁxed distance assumption is commonly accepted,
see [1]. However, we will relax this assumption in Section V.
We consider a path loss plus block fading channel with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading coefﬁcients.
The power path loss between two positions x, y ∈ R2 is given
by ℓ( x − y ) := (c + x − y α )−1 with path loss exponent
α. The parameter c > 0 ensures boundedness of ℓ. The power
fading coefﬁcient between a transmitter at x and a receiver at
y is given by gxy , where E [gxy ] = 1 for all x, y ∈ R2 .
We further place a receiver at y0 ∈ R2 and an intended
transmitter at an arbitrary position x0 ∈ R2 with distance d
to y0 . The pair x0 → y0 is called the reference pair as it will
allow us to measure the (spatially-averaged) link performance
for receivers at distance y0 from the origin.
Assuming ﬁxed power transmissions for all nodes, the
instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at
the reference receiver y0 is given by:

2) Letting y0 → 0, we further have
A2 (0, c) = log(1/2c) + E [log(2(r + c))] .

(4)

3) Letting c → 0, we have E [I(y0 )] = ∞, which is due to
the resulting singularity of ℓ( x − y0 ) at x = y0 , cf. [2].

where β is a modulation and coding speciﬁc SINR threshold.

5) Dense network (0 < limr→∞ F (r)rν < ∞, ν → 0): As
expected [2], E!x0 [I(y0 )] = ∞.

In case of Rayleigh fading channels, the Laplace transform
of I(y0 ), i.e., LI(y0 ) (s) := E [exp{−sI(y0 )}], is of signiﬁcant
importance, since it allows one to obtain the OP in closedform. When treating the case α = 2, we will always assume
that F (r) satisﬁes the additional condition of Theorem 1.
Theorem 3. For gxy ∼ Exp(1) for all x, y ∈ R2 (Rayleigh
fading), the Laplace transform of I(y0 ) at y0 ∈ R2 is

1) has an interesting interpretation as well: The expectation
can be seen as averaging the differential interference over
r. Such an interpretation may be appropriate when analyzing
networks with a priori unknown or fast-varying spatial conﬁgurations, for which a CDF is then used to model their spatial
shape. 4) implies I(y0 ) < ∞ a.s. although inﬁnitely many
nodes contribute to the interference on average. Note that 5)
includes the homogeneous case with F (r) = 1 (f (r) = 0).
We now extend the ﬁndings of Theorem 1. Before, we need
the following Lemma.

LI(y0 ) (s) = exp {−λs Aα (y0 , s + c)} ,

for the cases α = 2 and α = 4, where A2 (y0 , c) is given by
(8) and A4 (y0 , c) is given by (12).

We now study the OP for the reference pair x0 → y0 . In
order to broadly discuss the impact of the spatial shape on
the performance, we focus on the Rayleigh fading scenario.
For other channel models, the interference moments derived
in Section III can be used to effectively bound the OP, e.g.,
using the Markov inequality [1]. We do not expect additional
insights by considering also other channel models.
Theorem 4. The OP for the Rayleigh fading scenario and α =
2 respectively α = 4 is given by

where A4 (y0 , c) is given by (12) below.
Proof: The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 1
and uses the integral identity of Lemma 1. We further make
use of (ii) in Section II to show that limr→∞ F (r) < ∞.

Corollary 2. Summary of some special cases of Theorem 2:
1) Case c → 0: By taking the limit limc→0 A4 (y0 , c) in (12),
we observe that E!x0 [I(y0 )] = ∞, cf. 3) in Corollary 2.
2) Homogeneous case: Let F (r) = 1. Then, f (r) = 0 and

q(y0 ) = 1 − LI(y0 ) (β(c + dα )) exp {−βη} .

(14)

Proof: It is well-known that the OP for Aloha MAC and
exponentially distributed power gains gxy can be written in
terms of the Laplace transform of the interference [2], [6]:
We condition (2) on Φ and evaluate the OP ﬁrst with respect
to gx0 y0 . We ﬁnally use (13) with s = β(c + dα ).
By means of (14) in Theorem 4 we can now measure the
OP for Rayleigh fading at an arbitrary location for an arbitrary

a = ∞,

yielding E!x0 [I(y0 )] = λ 2π c as expected, cf. [2].
All results of this Corollary are consistent with the literature.

the interference distribution for the path loss only scenario.

noting that Lg (s) = (1 + s)−1 for g ∼ Exp(1), the integral is
computed using Identity 1 and 2, and Lemma 1.
Note that (a) in the proof holds for general point processes
and some approximation techniques for computing the righthand side already exist [12]. The (b) part is for PPPs only.
Corollary 3. Setting F (r) = 1 for all r ∈ R+ and c = 0, we

some algebraic manipulations. Note that according to [10], (5)

were veriﬁed to hold also for complex-valued parameters.

conﬁrming the analysis. It can further be observed how the
network “moves” from the interference-limited to the powerlimited regime with increasing y0 .
To highlight the accuracy of the model, we compare the OP
from Theorem 4 to a straightforward way of approximating
the OP which consists of assuming that the intensity λ(x) is
approximately constant around y0 . In this case the OP can then
be described as in the homogeneous case [2], except for the

The TC and its differential counterpart have similar meaning, except that the latter is position-dependent: For a given
spatial shape F (r) and target OP ǫ, c(x, ǫ) yields the TC in a
region dx. Hence, the DTC implicitly takes into account the
spatial shape of the node distribution. For Rayleigh fading,
c(x, ǫ) is obtained by solving (14) for λ. Like the TC, the DTC
can be used for comparing different transmission protocols.

A. Shot-range inhibition
Besides slotted Aloha, other MAC protocols such as
CSMA/CA or local FDMA, are promising techniques for
reducing excessive interference generated by nodes within
shot-range. To study ad hoc networks with such inhibition
mechanisms while ensuring analytical tractability, powerful
methods based on non-homogeneous Poisson approximation
have been used [6], [14], [15]. When such protocols are
transmitter-initiated, e.g., transmitter sensing for CSMA or
transmitter orthogonalization for FDMA, the resulting spatial distribution of interferers becomes inhomogeneous and
approximately isotropic around the transmitter x, while the
interference ﬁeld at the intended receiver y will depend on
the distance x − y . Hence, our model can be applied also
to such modeling problems and is not limited to Aloha MAC.

due to the stationarity assumption, was intensively studied.
For α = 4, we also obtain closed-form results, from which
known results arise as special cases. We proposed two metrics

Consider the following situation: Let the set {y} of potential
receivers be distributed as an isotropic PPP Φr of intensity
λr (r) = λr F (r). Assume that Φt and Φr are independent. That
is, the set of all nodes follows a PPP, e.g., a sensor network
created by airdrop, and connectivity at distance d is no longer
guaranteed for every node. We further assume that the routing
protocol employs a nearest neighbor strategy, i.e., transmitters
aim at minimizing d. For points distributed as a PPP, the CDF
Fd (d) of the distance d between a point and its nearest neighbor is well-known, see [6]. We would like to know the optimal
SINR threshold β such that the product log2 (1 + β) Ω(β) with
success function 1{x successful} 1{x connected} is maximized. This
corresponds to maximizing the expected sum rate, i.e.,

≈ arg max log2 (1 + β)

where we altered the notation Ω → Ω(β) and q(r) → q(r, β, d)
to point out the functional dependencies. (a) follows from
E [q( yi )|xi = xi ] ≈ q( xi ),
which essentially approximates the interference ﬁeld at a
receiver yi by the interference ﬁeld at the associated transmitter xi . This approximation is reasonable for high λr and/or
moderate slopes of F (r). Fig. 3 shows log2 (1+β) Ω(β) vs. β.
As can be seen, optimizing over β yields large improvements.
VI. C ONCLUDING R EMARKS
We extended prior work on the modeling and analysis of
wireless networks by assuming an isotropic but not necessarily
stationary spatial distribution of nodes. We derived, for slotted
Aloha, the interference and outage statistics as a function
of the receiver position and the shape of the spatial node
