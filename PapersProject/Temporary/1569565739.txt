quasi-static MIMO, without feedback and in the absence of
lattice reduction techniques3 , the above work revealed that to
achieve the optimal DMT d∗ (r), the complexity exponent is
upper bounded by a piecewise linear function which, at integer
r takes the form
c(r) = r(nT − r).
(2)

Abstract—The work analyzes the computational-complexity
savings that a single bit of feedback can provide in the computationally intense setting of non-ergodic MIMO communications.
Speciﬁcally we derive upper bounds on the feedback-aided complexity exponent required for the broad families of ML-based
and lattice based decoders to achieve the optimal diversitymultiplexing behavior. The bounds reveal a complexity that is
reduced from being exponential in the number of codeword bits,
to being at most exponential in the rate. Finally the derived
savings are met by practically constructed ARQ schemes, as
well as simple lattice designs, decoders, and computation-halting
policies.

This bound was shown to be tight for a broad range of
practical settings, and it also revealed a complexity that scales
exponentially with the number of codeword bits.
This very considerable complexity brought to the fore the
need for methods that manage to achieve the same nearoptimal performance, but do so with much reduced computational resources.
b) Feedback gains: In terms of feedback, the work in
[5] utilized the DMT machinery to analyze the reliability
gains of feedback, and to speciﬁcally show that an L-round
ARQ scheme can provide for a much increased feedback-aided
DMT which4 was shown to take the form d∗ (r/L).
Motivated by the considerable magnitude of the complexity
exponent in (2), we here seek to understand the role of
feedback in reducing complexity, rather than in improving
reliability. For this we seek to quantify the feedback-aided
complexity exponent required to achieve the original d∗ (r) in
the presence of a modiﬁed version of the above mentioned Lround MIMO ARQ. Speciﬁcally we will derive upper bounds
on the minimum5 complexity exponent required by ML and
regularized (MMSE-preprocessed) lattice based sphere decoders (SD) to achieve the optimal DMT d∗ (r) . We will
focus on the family of minimum delay ARQ schemes (to
be described later on). The derivations focus on ML-based
decoding, but given the equivalence of ML and regularized
lattice based decoding shown in [3], these same results extend
automatically to the regularized lattice decoding case. We
note that the validity of the presented bounds depends on the
existence of actual schemes that meet them. These schemes
will be here provided, together with the associated lattice
designs, decoders, as well as halting and ordering polices.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The current work is a continuation of studies on the ratereliability-complexity limits of non-ergodic MIMO communications1 . In this setting, computational complexity and ratereliability performance are highly intertwined, in the sense that
limitations to computational resources (commonly measured
by ﬂoating point operations - ﬂops), bring about substantial
degradation in the system performance. In the high rate setting
of interest, the lion’s share of computational costs is due to
decoding algorithms, on which we here focus, speciﬁcally
considering the broad family of ML-based and regularized
(MMSE-preprocessed) lattice decoding algorithms.
a) Error and complexity exponents: In terms of reliability, the diversity multiplexing tradeoff (DMT, cf. [1]) has
been extensively used to quantify the relationship between the
rate, denoted as R, and the probability of error Perr . In the
high SNR regime (SNR will be henceforth denoted as ρ),
this relationship was described in [1] using the high SNR
measures of multiplexing gain r := R/ log ρ and diversity
gain d(r) := − limρ→∞ log Perr / log ρ. As a result the same
work revealed, for the case of no feedback, the optimal DMT
in the form of the maximum possible diversity gain d∗ (r) for
a given r.
The work in [2]–[4] provided a similar treatment for
complexity. Speciﬁcally for Nmax denoting the amount of
computational reserves, in ﬂops per duration of one codeword,
that the transceiver is endowed with2 , the work in [2], [3]
introduced the complexity exponent to take the form
c(r) := lim

3 We here note that while lattice reduction (LR) indeed allows here for nearoptimal behavior at very manageable complexity, it is the case that there exist
scenarios for which these same LR methods cannot be readily applied. Such
problematic cases include the ubiquitous scenario where outer binary codes
are employed and decoded using soft information. It is for this exact reason
that we focus on the complexity analysis of non LR-aided schemes which
remains of strong interest for many pertinent communication scenarios.
4 This held for the setting of quasi-static fading and no power adaptation which is the setting of interest here.
5 By minimum we refer to a minimization over all lattice code designs
(which must vary accordingly depending on the setting), all policies of
computational halting, and all policies on decoding ordering. A decoding
ordering policy describes the order in which the transmitted information
symbols are decoded by sphere decoding algorithm.

The analysis and the constructed feedback schemes tell us
how to properly utilize a single bit of feedback to alleviate the
adverse effects of computational constraints, as those seen in
the derived rate-reliability-complexity tradeoffs of [4].
Before proceeding to a brief description of the MIMO ARQ
signaling, we quickly note that we here employ an ARQ
variant which reduces the L-round scheme to a two-round
scheme with uneven but ﬁxed durations, and we do so by
disregarding all but the ﬁrst and last rounds. Such a scheme
requires just one bit of feedback. We will however, for clarity
of exposition, maintain use of the notation of the better known
L-round scheme.

The proof of the above theorem will be presented in
Appendix A, together with the proofs for the upcoming
Propositions 1 and 2, and it will include the derivation of
the upper bound, and the constructive achievement of this
bound which is presented in Propositions 1, 2. The constructive
part of the proof is based on designing ARQ schemes and
implementations (lattice designs and halting policies) that meet
the bound. We proceed with these propositions where we
identify cases for which the above complexity bound sufﬁces
to achieve d∗ (r) with the help of feedback.
An important aspect in ARQ schemes is knowing when to
decode and when not to decode across the different rounds.
Towards this we have the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1 (Aggressive intermediate halting policies):
We deﬁne aggressive intermediate halting policies to be
the family of policies that halt decoding in the ﬁrst round
whenever the minimum singular value of the channel scales
as ρ− for some > 0, which do not decode in the second to
the L-1 round, and which decode at the last round iff a) they
have not decoded in the ﬁrst round and b) the channel is not
in outage with respect to the effective rate of ARQ scheme.
Given such aggressive halting policies, the L round scheme
reduces to a two round scheme where the second round
comprises of (L − 1)T channel uses. As noted before, for
notational uniformity with earlier works in [5], [6], we will
continue to use the notation of the L-round schemes but again
clarify that only one bit of ARQ feedback is needed.
Furthermore we will henceforth use the term ARQcompatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice designs to
refer to the family of nT × nT lattice designs XARQ,L with
C
total number of transmitted integers κ = 2nT , with nonvanishing determinant (NVD)8 for r ≤ 1, and with all the
information appearing in all rounds.
Proposition 1: A minimum delay ARQ scheme with L =
nT rounds achieves d∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ cred (r), irrespective
of the ARQ-compatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice
design, for any aggressive intermediate halting policy, and any
sphere decoding order policy.
The following describes a very simple MIMO ARQ coding
implementation that achieves d∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ cred (r). The
proof of this proposition will appear later on, and is crucial in
the achievability part of the proof of Theorem 1.
Proposition 2: The minimum delay ARQ scheme with L =
nT rounds, implemented with any aggressive intermediate
halting policy, any sphere decoding order policy, and a rate-1

A. MIMO-ARQ signaling
We here present the general nT ×nR MIMO-ARQ signaling
setting, and focus on the details which are necessary for
our exposition. For further understanding of the MIMO-ARQ
channel, the reader is referred to [5] as well as [6].
Under ARQ signaling, each message is associated to a
unique block [X1 X2 · · · XL ] of signaling matrices, where

We proceed with quantifying the complexity reductions due
to ARQ feedback.
II. C OMPLEXITY REDUCTION USING ARQ FEEDBACK
We here seek to analyze the complexity reductions due to
MIMO ARQ feedback. Speciﬁcally for d∗ (r) denoting the
optimal DMT of the nT × nR MIMO channel in the absence
of feedback, we here seek to describe the feedback-aided
complexity exponent required to meet the same d∗ (r) with
the assistance now of an L-round ARQ scheme. As stated
before, our analysis focuses on the setting of L ≤ nT and of
minimum-delay ARQ schemes, corresponding to T = 1. The
derived exponent is to be compared with the exponent in (2)
(cf. [2, Theorem 6] and [3, Corollary 1b]) corresponding to no
feedback. The following holds for the nT × nR (nR ≥ nT ),
i.i.d. regular fading7 MIMO channel.
Theorem 1: Let c(r) be the minimum complexity exponent
required to achieve d∗ (r), minimized over all lattice designs,
all ARQ schemes with L ≤ nT rounds of ARQ, all halting
6 Loosely speaking, unique decodability means that, for any = 1, · · · , L,
the corresponding XARQ, carries all bits of information.
C
7 The i.i.d. regular fading statistics satisfy the general set of conditions as
described in [7], where a) the near-zero behavior of the fading coefﬁcients h
is bounded in probability as c1 |h|t ≤ p(h) ≤ c2 |h|t for some positive and
ﬁnite c1 , c2 and t, where b) the tail behavior of h is bounded in probability
β
as p(h) ≤ c2 e−b|h| for some positive and ﬁnite c2 , b and β, and where c)
p(h) is upper bounded by a constant K.

8 A code has a non-vanishing determinant if, without power normalization,
there is a lower bound on the minimum determinant that does not depend
on the constellation size. The determinant of any non-normalized difference
matrix is lower bounded by a constant independent of ρ (see [8]).

(cf. [8], [9])9 , achieves d∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ cred (r).
Theorem 1 has quantiﬁed the computational reserves that
are sufﬁcient to achieve DMT optimality. These computational
reserves can be seen to be smaller than those required to
achieve the same optimal DMT d∗ (r) without feedback. For
example, given any known minimum-delay DMT optimal
design which remains ﬁxed for all r, in the absence of
feedback, the exponent needed to achieve d∗ (r) is that in (2)
(cf. [2, Theorem 6] and [3, Corollary 1b]) and takes the form
c(r) = r(nT − r),

We now consider the case of nR ≤ nT , and speciﬁcally
the case where nR |nT (i.e., nT is an integer multiple of nR ),
to observe again how simple implementations offer substantial
reductions in complexity. In terms of statistics, the results hold
for any i.i.d. regular fading distribution.

for L = nT , T = 1 this exponent reduces to a much smaller

Generally, given a rate that scales linearly with nT , in the
absence of feedback the complexity exponent of achieving
d∗ (r) scales with n2 , whereas the feedback aided complexity

exponent scales with nT .
Example 2: Figure 1 considers the case of nT = 4 ≤ nR
and Rayleigh fading, and compares the above complexity
upper bound in the presence of feedback (L = 4, T = 1),
to the equivalent complexity exponent in (5) of achieving the
same optimal DMT d∗ (r) without ARQ feedback (Perfect
codes and natural, ﬁxed decoding ordering (cf. [2])). The
feedback-aided complexity exponent reveals an exponential
reduction by a factor of nT = 4.

Applying as the constructive part of the proof of the above
theorem, the following describes a very simple MIMO ARQ
block-diagonal repetition coding implementation that achieves
d∗ (r) with a much reduced c(r) ≤ cred (r).

The proof of Theorem 2 and Proposition 3 will be presented
in Appendix B. Of interest is the special MISO-ARQ case of
nR = 1, where the above described scheme will allow for a
zero complexity exponent, and for a complexity that scales as a
subpolynomial function of ρ and as a subexponential function
of the number of codeword bits and of the rate.

general lattice designs derived from cyclic division algebra (CDA) (cf.
[8], [9]), F and L are number ﬁelds, with L a ﬁnite, cyclic Galois extension
of F of degree n. Let σ denote a generator of the Galois group Gal(L/F).
Let z be an indeterminate satisfying lz = zσ(l), ∀ l ∈ L and z n = γ for
some non-norm element γ ∈ F∗ . Then the set of all elements of the form

The proof follows from the footsteps of the [2, proof of
Theorem 2]. Due to space limitations we restrict this exposition to the proof steps that are necessary to understand the
complexity exponent for the novel ARQ schemes discussed in
this paper. For further understanding of encoders and decoders
considered here, the reader is referred to [2], [4]. We begin by
establishing necessary conditions for L-round ARQ scheme to
achieve d∗ (r) over an nT × nR (nR ≥ nT ) MIMO.
Condition 1: To achieve maximum diversity gain of nR .nT
the total number of channel uses LT ≥ nT . For minimum
delay (T = 1) L-round ARQ schemes with L ≤ nT , it then
follows that L = nT .
Condition 2: To achieve maximum multiplexing gain of nT
the total number of integers transmitted κ ≥ 2nT T = 2nT .
It can be seen from [2] that the complexity of sphere decoder
increases with κ. Thus, for minimum delay L-round ARQ
schemes with L ≤ nT , the tightest upper bound on the
complexity exponent is established by considering T = 1,
L = nT and κ = 2nT . Setting T = 1 and L = nT implies
use of at least rate-1 lattice designs for L-round ARQ scheme
for achieving DMT performance of d∗ (r) for 0 ≤ r ≤ nT .
We will later show that encoding-decoding policy described
in Proposition 1 and Proposition 2 achieve DMT performance

For the proof to be complete we must now prove that the
aforementioned family of ARQ schemes, halting policies and
lattice designs can indeed achieve the desired DMT d∗ (r). For
this purpose we recall the following lemma from [10]:
Lemma 1: For an i.i.d. regular fading channel, a minimum
delay ARQ scheme with L = nT rounds achieves d∗ (r)
for all ARQ-compatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice
designs, all intermediate aggressive halting policies and a
r
sphere decoder with search radius ξ > d∗ ( L ) log ρ.
In the presence of Lemma 1 and upper bound cred (r), it is
direct to see that a minimum delay ARQ scheme with L =
nT rounds achieves d∗ (r) with c(r) ≤ cred (r), irrespective
of the ARQ-compatible, minimum delay, NVD, rate-1 lattice
design, for any aggressive intermediate halting policy, and any
decoding order policy. This proves Theorem 1, Proposition 1
and Proposition 2.
