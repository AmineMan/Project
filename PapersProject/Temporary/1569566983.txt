Iterative Estimation of Constrained
Rank-One Matrices in Noise
Sundeep Rangan

and Alyson K. Fletcher

Abstract—We consider the problem of estimating a rank-one
matrix in Gaussian noise under a probabilistic model for the
left and right factors of the matrix. The probabilistic model can
impose constraints on the factors including sparsity and positivity
that arise commonly in learning problems. We propose a simple
iterative procedure that reduces the problem to a sequence
of scalar estimation computations. The method is similar to
approximate message passing techniques based on Gaussian
approximations of loopy belief propagation that have been used
recently in compressed sensing. Leveraging analysis methods by
Bayati and Montanari, we show that the asymptotic behavior of
the estimates from the proposed iterative procedure is described
by a simple scalar equivalent model, where the distribution
of the estimates is identical to certain scalar estimates of the
variables in Gaussian noise. Moreover, the effective Gaussian
noise level is described by a set of state evolution equations. The
proposed method thus provides a computationally simple and
general method for rank-one estimation problems with a precise
analysis in certain high-dimensional settings.

This paper proposes a variant of such alternating optimization procedures that we call Iterative Factorization (IterFac),
stated in detail in Algorithm 1 below. Through proper selection
of relevant parameters, the IterFac algorithm can perform
alternating minimizations to optimizations of the form
(u, v) := arg min F (u, v),
u∈Rm ,v∈Rn

(2)

where the objective function is given by
1
2
A − uvT F + cU (u) + cV (v).
F (u, v) =
(3)
2m
Here, X F is the Frobenius norm and cU (u) and cV (v)
are cost or regularization functions on the left and right
factors. In the case when the cost functions are separable, the
IterFac algorithm reduces the vector optimization problem to
a sequence of scalar optimization problems on the individual
components of u and v; it is thus computationally simple. The
IterFac methodology is also genearl since the method can be
applied to essentially arbitrary separable cost functions.
Of course, such iterative algorithms are by no means
new; they underlie many existing methods, including the
classic alternating power method for ﬁnding maximal singular
values [1] and some alternating methods in sparse or nonnegative dictionary learning [3]–[7]. More recently, an alternating method has been proposed for estimation with matrix
uncertainties [8], also using an approximate message passing
technique. The IterFac iterations also have some similarities to
the updates in gradient descent methods in sparse dictionary
learning such as in [9].
Our main contribution is to show that, under a particular
setting of a damping parameter, the IterFac algorithm admits
an asymptotically-exact characterization when W is i.i.d.
Gaussian noise and the components of the true vectors u0 and
v0 have limiting empirical distributions. In this scenario, we
show that the empirical joint distribution of the components of
u0 and the corresponding estimates from the IterFac algorithm
are described by a simple scalar equivalent model where
the IterFac component estimates are identically distributed
to scalar estimates of the variables corrupted by Gaussian
noise. Moreover, the effective Gaussian noise level in this
model is described by a simple set of scalar state evolution
(SE) equations. From the scalar equivalent model, one can
compute the asymptotic value of almost any componentseparable metric including mean-squared error or correlation.
Thus, in addition to being computationally simple and general,
the IterFac algorithm admits a precise analysis in the case of
Gaussian noise. Moreover, since ﬁxed points of the IterFac

We consider the problem of estimating vectors u0 ∈ Rm
and v0 ∈ Rn from a matrix A ∈ Rm×n of the form
√
T
(1)
A = u0 v0 + mW,
√
where W represents some unknown noise and m is a
normalization factor. The problem can be considered as a rankone special case of ﬁnding a low-rank matrix in the presence
of noise. Such low-rank estimation problems arise in a range
of applications including blind channel estimation, antenna
array processing, subspace system identiﬁcation, and principal
component or factor analysis.
When the noise term W is zero, the vector pair (u0 , v0 ) can
be recovered exactly, up to a scaling, from the maximal left
and right singular vectors of A [1]. However, in the presence
of noise, the rank-one matrix can in general only be estimated
approximately. In this case, a priori information or constraints
on (u0 , v0 ) may improve the estimation. Such constraints
arise, for example, in factor analysis in statistics, where one
of the factors is often constrained to be either positive or
sparse [2]. Similar sparsity constraints arise in the problem
of dictionary learning [3]. In digital communications, one of
the factors could come from a discrete QAM constellation.
Unfortunately, optimal estimation with constraints on u0
or v0 is often computationally intractable. The chief problem
T
is the bilinear nature of the term u0 v0 . However, the term
is linear in u0 and v0 separately. Thus, many suboptimal
estimation methods are performed in an iterative manner,
alternately estimating u0 and v0 individually, while holding
the estimate of the other factor constant.

algorithm correspond, under suitable circumstances, to local
minima of objectives such as (3), the analysis can be used to
characterize the behavior of such minima—even if alternate
algorithms to IterFac are used.
The main analytical tool is a recently-developed technique
by Bayati and Montanari [10] used in the analysis of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms. AMP methods
are Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation for
estimation of vectors under large random linear measurements.
The work [10] applied AMP techniques to compressed sensing, and proved that, in the limit for large Gaussian mixing
matrices, the behavior of AMP estimates can be described by
a scalar equivalent model with effective noise levels deﬁned
by certain scalar state evolution (SE) equations. Similar SE
analyses have appeared in related contexts [11]–[16]. To prove
the SE equations for the IterFac algorithm, we apply a key
theorem from [10] with a simple change of variables and a
slight modiﬁcation to account for parameter adaptation. A
complete version of this paper is available at [17], which
contains all the proofs and more details.

A. Model and Assumptions
We analyze the algorithm under the following assumptions.
Assumption 1: Consider a sequence of random realizations
of the estimation problem in Section I indexed by the dimension n. The matrix A and the parameters in Algorithm 1 satisfy
the following:
(a) For each n, the output dimension m = m(n) is deterministic and scales linearly with the input dimension in
that
lim n/m(n) = β
(7)

For a matrix A ∈ Rm×n , we consider the following iterative
algorithm for estimating the rank-one factors u0 and v0 .

for some β > 0.
(b) The matrix A has the form (1) where u0 ∈ Rm and
v0 ∈ Rn represent “true” left and right factors of a rank
one term, and W ∈ Rm×n is an i.i.d. Gaussian matrix
with components Wij ∼ N (0, τw ) for some τw > 0.

for some scalar functions Gu (t, p, λu ) and Gv (t, q, λv )
satisfying certain Lipschitz continuity and differentiability assumptions, see [17].
(d) The damping factors are selected by the rules

The output of the algorithm, (u(t), v(t)), t = 0, 1, . . ., is a
sequence of estimates for (u0 , v0 ). The algorithm has several
parameters including the initial conditions, the parameters in
lines 5 and 9, the termination condition and, most importantly,
the functions Gu (·) and Gv (·). In each iteration, the functions
Gu (·) and Gv (·) are used to generate the estimates of the
factors u(t) and v(t). Gu (·) and Gv (·) will thus be called the
factor selection functions.
To understand the role of the factor selection functions,
suppose that we wish to perform the optimization (2) for some
regularization functions cU (·) and cV (·). Consider the factor

B. Main Result
Our main result, Theorem 1 below, will provide a characterization of the asymptotic empirical distribution for the sets
θu (t) and θv (t) in (10). Speciﬁcally, we will show that, for all
t, the sets have empirical limits of the form

for some random variable pairs (U0 , U (t) and (V0 , V (t)). The
distributions of the random variables (U0 , U (t) and (V0 , V (t))
can be described recursively in t as follows: For t = 0,
(V0 , V (0)) is the random variable pair in the initial condition
Assumption 1(f). Then, for t ≥ 0, (U0 , U (t+1)) is given by

A. Linear Selection Functions
As a ﬁrst simple application of the SE analysis, suppose we
use linear selection functions of the form

αu1 (t) = E [U0 U (t)] , (14a)

αv0 (t) = E V (t)2 ,

(16)

which represent the cosines of the angles between the estimates u(t) and v(t) and the true vectors u0 and v0 .

where V0 is the empirical limit in in Assumption 1(f), and
Zv (t) is Gaussian noise independent of V0 .
The constants αu0 (t), αu1 (t), αv0 (t), αv1 (t), λu (t), and
λv (t) in (12) and (13) are deterministic sequences of scalars
deﬁned recursively by
2

φ(u0i , ui (t)) = E [φ(U0 , U (t))] ,
i=1

where the expectation on the right-hand side is over the variables (U0 , U (t)) with U0 identical to the variable in the limit in
Assumption 1(f) and U (t) given by (12a). This expectation can
be explicitly evaluated by a simple two-dimensional integral
and consequently any component-separable performance metric based on a suitably continuous loss function φ(u0 , u), such
as mean-squared error can be exactly computed. The full paper
[17] shows, in particular, that one can evaluate the asymptotic
correlations

where U0 is the random variable in Assumption 1(f); Gu (·)
is the scalar function in Assumption 1(d); and Zu (t) is
Gaussian noise independent of U0 . Thus, U (t+1) is distributed
identically to the output of the scalar function Gu (t, P (t)),
where P (t) is a scaled and Gaussian noise-corrupted version of
the true variable U0 . Similarly, for t ≥ 0, the random variable
(V0 , V (t+1)) in (11b) is given by

which are initialized with the values αv0 (0) and αv1 (0) from
the joint distribution of (V0 , V (0)) in Assumption 1(f). The
subsequent values of αu0 (t), αu1 (t), αv0 (t), αv1 (t), λu (t)
and λv (t) can then be computed recursively through (14) along
with the deﬁnition of the variables in (12) and (13). In line
with [10] upon which our analysis is based, we will call the
set of recursive equations (12)–(15) the state evolution (SE)
equations. From the solution to the SE equations, we get the
exact descriptions of the limits in (11).
Theorem 1: Under Assumption 1, the sets θu (t) and θv (t)
in (10) converge empirically with bounded moments of order
p with the limits in (11).
The main contribution of Theorem 1 is that it provides
a simple scalar equivalent model for the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm. The sets θu (t) = {(u0i , ui (t))} and
θv (t) = {(v0j , vj (t))} in (10) are the components of true
vectors u0 and v0 and their estimates u(t) and v(t). The
theorem shows that empirical distribution of these components
are asymptotically equivalent to simple random variable pairs
(U0 , U (t)) and (V0 , V (t)) given by (12a) and (13a). Following
[18], we can thus call the result a single-letter characterization.
From this single-letter characterization, one can exactly
compute a large class of performance metrics of the algorithm.
Speciﬁcally, the empirical convergence of θu (t) shows that
for any pseudo-Lipschitz function φ(u0 , u) of order p, the
following limit exists almost surely:

(10a)
(10b)

For t = 0, as n → ∞ the sets θu (0) and θv (t) empirically
converge with bounded moments of order 2p − 2 for
some p ≥ 1 to some random variable pairs (U0 , U (0)
and (V0 , V (0)). See [17] for a precise deﬁnition of the
empirical convergence used here.

where the parameters λu and λv allow for normalization or
other scalings of the outputs. Linear selection functions of the
form (18) arise when one selects Gu (·) and Gv (·) from (4)
with zero cost functions, cU (u) = cV (v) = 0. With zero
cost functions, the correct solution to the optimization (2)
is for (u, v) to be the (appropriately scaled) left and right
maximal singular vectors of A. We will thus call the estimates
(u(t), v(t)) of Algorithm 1 and linear selection functions (18)
the estimated maximal singular vectors.

where D ∼ N (0, 1) is independent of U0 and V0 . That is,
Eu (ηu ) and Ev (ηv ) are the mean-squared errors of estimating
U0 and V0 from observations Y with SNRs of ηu and ηv .
The functions Eu (·) and Ev (·) arise in a range of estimation
problems and the analytic and functional properties of these
functions can be found in [21], [22].

initial condition V (0) = E[V0 ]. Then:

To validate the SE analysis, we consider a simple case where
the left factor u0 ∈ Rm is i.i.d. Gaussian, zero mean and
v0 ∈ Rn has Bernoulli-Exponential components:
v0j ∼

0
Exp(1)

with prob 1 − λ,
with prob λ,

(24)

which provides a simple model for a sparse, positive vector.
The parameter λ is the fraction of nonzero components and
is set in this simulation to λ = 0.1. The dimensions are
(m, n) = (1000, 500), and the noise level τw is set according
to the scaled SNR deﬁned as
SNR = 10 log10 (τu τv /τw ).

(25)

Estimating the vector v0 in this set-up is related to ﬁnding
sparse principal vectors of the matrix AT A [2], [23]–[27].
The results of the simulation are shown in Fig. 1, which
shows the simulated and SE-predicted performance of the
IterFac algorithm with both the linear and MMSE selection
functions for the priors on u and v. The algorithm is run
for t = 10 iterations and the plot shows the median of the
ﬁnal correlation coefﬁcient ρv (t) over 50 Monte Carlo trials at
each value of SNR. It can be seen that the performance of the
IterFac algorithm for both the linear and MMSE estimates are
in excellent agreement with the SE predictions. The correlation
coefﬁcient of the linear estimator also matches the correlation
of the estimates produced from the maximal singular vectors of
A. This is not surprising since, with linear selection functions,
the IterFac algorithm is essentially an iterative method to
ﬁnd the maximal singular vectors. The ﬁgure also shows the
beneﬁt of exploiting the prior on v0 , which is evident from the

B. Minimum Mean-Squared Error Estimation
Next suppose that the priors on U0 and V0 are known. In
this case, given (12a) and (13a), a natural choice for the factor
selection functions are
Gv (t, q) = E[V0 | Q(t)],

where [x]+ = max{0, x}.
The theorem provides a set of recursive equations for the
asymptotic correlation coefﬁcients ρu (t) and ρv (t) along with
simple expressions for the limiting values as t → ∞. We thus
obtain exactly how correlated the estimated maximal singular
vectors of a matrix A of the form (1) are to the rank one factors
(u0 , v0 ). The proof of the theorem also provides expressions
for the second-order statistics in (14) to be used in the scalar
equivalent model.
The ﬁxed point expressions (20) agree with the more general
results in [19] that derive the correlations for ranks greater
than one and low-rank recovery with missing entries. Similar
results can also be found in [20]. An interesting consequence
√
of the expressions in (20) is that unless βτu τv > τw , the
asymptotic correlation coefﬁcients are exactly zero. The ratio
τu τv /τw can be interpreted as a scaled SNR.

with the initial condition ρv (0) = (EV0 )2 /τv .
(b) If, in addition, Eu (ηu ) and Ev (ηv ) are continuous, then for
any positive initial condition, ρv (0) > 0, as t → ∞, the
asymptotic correlation coefﬁcients (ρu (t), ρv (t)) increase
monotonically to ﬁxed points (ρ∗ , ρ∗ ) of (23) with ρ∗ >
u u

Again, we see that we can obtain simple, explicit recursions
for the asymptotic correlations.

which are the MMSE estimates of the variables. In this
example, there are no parameters λu or λv . We can use the
initial condition vj (0) = E[V0 ] for all j, so that the initial
variable in Assumption 1(f) is V (0) = E[V0 ]. To analyze the
algorithms deﬁne

C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK
We have presented a computationally-efﬁcient method for
estimating rank-one matrices in noise. The estimation problem
is reduced to a sequence of scalar AWGN estimation problems
which can be performed easily for a large class of priors
or regularization functions on the coefﬁcients. In the case of
Gaussian noise, the asymptotic performance of the algorithm
is exactly characterized by a set of scalar state evolution
equations which appear to match the performance at moderate
dimensions well. Thus, the methodology is computationally
simple, general and admits a precise analysis in certain
asymptotic, random settings. However, to make the algorithm
practical, we need to extend the method to higher ranks and
handle the case where the priors are not known. The full paper
[17] suggests some methods for addressing these issues in the
future.
