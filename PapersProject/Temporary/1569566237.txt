and in any model where the mean and variance of the market
offer a good approximation of its performance. In breif, the
operational procedure is simple: given a utility function and
the estimated parameters of a model, it is possible, although
sometimes computational hard, to estimate an optimal portfolio. However, the converse is true as well: if we are given
a utility function and an estimated optimal portfolio, we
can deduce the corresponding parameter estimates of for the
model. We apply this observation to dissect an approximate
fractional Kelly portfolio to discover that it is identical to
the full Kelly portfolio constructed from an estimate of the
mean return which is statistically shrunk towards the risk-free
rate. Therefore, a fractional Kelly investor is in fact a full
Kelly investor who uses an improved estimator of the market’s
parameters. There is power in this observation: while we do
not know how to select an optimal Kelly fraction, we do know
how to select an optimal shrinkage intensity. As these are the
same problem, we can offer a principled and completely datadependent method to select a Kelly fraction.
The remainder of this paper is laid out as follows. In
Section II, we give a brief overview of shrinkage estimation
and its applications in portfolio selection. In Section III, we
lay out the basics of the market model and the expected
utility framework in which we will work. In Section IV,
we introduce the approximate Kelly portfolio, and show how
this relates to the expected utility framework and the general
framework of modern portfolio theory. In Section V, we
exhibit a relationship between approximate fractional Kelly
portfolios and shrinkage estimators, and argue that this relationship explains why fractional Kelly strategies work well in
practice. Section VI brieﬂy recapitulates the argument of the
prior sections and lists some open problems.

Abstract—The log-optimal or Kelly portfolio forms the basis
of a theoretically appealing investment strategy. However, it is
difﬁcult to compute, and this hinders its adoption in practice. In
this paper we consider an approximate Kelly portfolio based on
maximizing the expected value of a quadratic approximation to
log utility. We show that this semi-log approximation gives an
information-theoretic justiﬁcation for portfolio selection based
on either the mean-variance efﬁcient frontier or the Sharpe
ratio. We further show that there is a strong connection between
estimated approximate fractional Kelly portfolios and shrinkage
estimators, which leads to an optimal choice of a fractional Kelly
parameter. We conclude by showing that the fractional Kelly
portfolio succeeds not because of reduced risk, but because of
reduced estimation error. We simulate to show that this property
is largely responsible for the good empirical performance of
fractional Kelly strategies.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The log-optimal or Kelly portfolio is a powerful tool but
is not always easy to apply. On the one hand, under fairly
general assumptions it is guaranteed to outperform any other
portfolio in the long run. On the other hand, it is difﬁcult
to compute, unappetizingly volatile, and not guaranteed to
outperform any speciﬁc portfolio over more modest time
horizons. An alternative, due to [1], is the Universal Portfolio
strategy, which will asymptotically converge to the log-optimal
portfolio for an sequence of returns. However, it can be
difﬁcult to compute (although there are approximations) and
the rate of convergence to the optimum is slow.
Another popular alternative is the fractional or partial Kelly
strategy, which speciﬁes that an investor puts a fraction α
of their wealth into the Kelly portfolio, leaving the rest in
cash while rebalancing in each investment period. While the
fractional Kelly portfolio is no easier to compute than the full
Kelly portfolio, it has one signiﬁcant advantage: the volatility
of the α-Kelly portfolio is simply α2 times the volatility of
the full Kelly portfolio, so even a modest partial Kelly strategy
can signiﬁcantly cut the investor’s realized volatility. In theory,
this decrease in volatility comes with a corresponding decrease
in the long-run growth rate. In practice, however, partial Kelly
strategies often outperform full Kelly strategies, and not just
over very short horizons.
While this apparent contradiction is not of concern to the
average investor, it does present a theoretical difﬁculty. In this
paper, we offer a statistical resolution for the contradiction
that applies in both the log-normal model for stock returns

II. A B RIEF OVERVIEW OF S HRINKAGE E STIMATION
The theory of shrinkage estimation was introduced in [2],
when Charles Stein observed that the sample average is an
inadmissible estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal
distribution in three or more dimensions. Since then it has
become a major part of modern statistical theory and practice.
We refer the interested reader to [3, 4] for an overview of the
early approaches to and applications of shrinkage estimation.
The general recipe for a shrinkage estimator is simple. We
are given two estimators: one with low variance and high bias,
and one with low bias and high variance. We then form a

1

convex combination of these two estimators which minimizes
the expected squared 2 distance of the combination from the
true value.
The most straightforward application of shrinkage estimation to portfolio selection is simply the use of improved
estimators to reduce the effect of estimation error on the
chosen portfolio. While some authors focus their attention
solely on improving the sample mean (see [5]), the majority
of effort is directed towards improving estimates of the sample
covariance matrix as well (see, e.g., [6]–[8]).
However, there is evidence of a deeper connection between
shrinkage estimation and portfolio selection. In [9], it is shown
that picking the optimal long-only portfolio is equivalent to
picking an unconstrained portfolio using a shrinkage estimator
of the covariance matrix. In what follows, we will exhibit
another such connection.

but our future calculations will be easier to interpret if we use
the equivalent formulation

III. P RELIMINARIES

Much can be written about the interpretation of this quantity,
but we will be satisﬁed with the observation that if we
imagine two investors with the same total wealth, the one
with the higher relative risk aversion will prefer to keep a
larger proportion of their wealth in a safe asset.
Under the assumption that the returns in each period are independent and identically distributed, an investor who invests
in the Kelly portfolio w∗ will invest a constant proportion of
wealth in each period. As one might expect, this is optimal
in the expected utility framework exactly when the investor’s
relative risk aversion is constant (see [14, 15]). As shown in
[12, 13], the only utility functions with constant relative risk
aversion are the isoelastic utility functions, which are of the
form

1−θ
−1
 (1 + Xw )
θ=1
Uθ (Xw ) =
1−θ

log(1 + Xw )
θ=1

Xw = rf + wT (R − rf )
B. Risk Aversion and Utility
An investor’s tolerance for risk is quantiﬁed with a utility
function. Not all choices are are unambiguous : any two utility
functions U1 and U2 such that U2 (x) = aU1 (x)+b with a > 0
will lead to the same relative decisions in all circumstances
(see, e.g., [11]). Therefore, we wish to have a measure of
risk tolerance which is invariant under afﬁne transformations.
There is a ready-made solution in the Arrow-Pratt risk aversion
measures deﬁned in [12, 13]. We will focus on the relative risk
aversion, which is deﬁned by
r(x) = −

A. A Simple Market Model
We begin with the strongest set of market assumptions
that yield an interesting problem. We assume that the market
consists of k risky assets whose return (the percentage change
in price) in the nth period is denoted Rn . When no period
need be speciﬁed, we drop the subscript n. We further assume
that there is one riskless asset whose constant return is denoted
rf . We will use rf to denote the vector rf 1.
We assume that the sequence of returns is independent
and identically distributed with mean µ = rf and invertible
covariance matrix Σ. We assume that any asset may be bought
or sold in any quantity at any time without transaction costs,
and that there are no restrictions on short sales.
We will use w to denote the weights of a portfolio comprised of the risky assets, and Gi (w) to denote the equivalent
continuously compounded interest rate during period n. A
classic result of ﬁnancial information theory (see [10]) states
that
1
n→∞ n

An investor whose utility function is equal to Uθ will have
relative risk aversion identically equal to θ. We brieﬂy note that
θ ≤ 0 does not correspond empirically to investor behavior
(see [13, 16]). As a result, we assume through the remainder
of this paper that θ > 0.

which we will denote as G(w). The Kelly portfolio w∗ is
simply the portfolio which maximizes G(w). If we deﬁne our

In this section, we assume that the distribution of returns is
known. We will give a simple formula for an approximation to
the fractional Kelly portfolio, and reinterpret standard concepts
in portfolio theory in light of our ﬁndings.
Following [17]–[20], we apply Taylor’s theorem to ﬁnd that

Uθ (Xw ) = Xw − Xw + O(Xw )

This is simply the amount by which the growth rate of the
optimal portfolio exceeds that of the portfolio with weights
w.
Finally, we will write Xw to denote the total return to the
portfolio w in a single period. By deﬁnition, we have

We pause to comment on two standard topics in portfolio
theory. The ﬁrst is portfolio selection based on the meanvariance efﬁcient frontier detailed in [23, 24]. In brief, the
efﬁcient frontier consists of the set of portfolios w which
maximize functions of the form wT (µ−rf )− θ wT Σw where
2
θ ≥ 0 is a free parameter measuring risk tolerance. These
functions are exactly our approximations to expected isoelastic
utility, and so we have an alternate characterization of the
efﬁcient frontier. While the mean-variance approximation to
logarithmic utility is well-known (see [17]–[20]), the use of
the efﬁcient frontier to approximate the expectations of all
isoelastic utilities is not. Furthermore, we can interpret the risk
tolerance parameter θ as the Arrow-Pratt relative risk aversion
discussed in Section III-B.
The second is the Sharpe ratio s ([25, 26]). The maximum
possible portfolio growth rate is equal to
1
T
(µ − rf ) Σ−1 (µ − rf )
2
which is the squared Mahalanobis distance between the mean
return and the vector rf . In the case where there is a single
risky asset (which may itself be a portfolio of assets), this
is simply 1 s2 . Therefore, a portfolio formed from an asset
2
with a high squared Sharpe ratio will eventually outperform a
portfolio formed from an asset with a low squared Sharpe
ratio, and an investor who is selecting a single asset for
investment is justiﬁed in using the Sharpe ratio on informationtheoretic grounds. Furthermore, an investor who is selecting
a collection of assets should examine the maximum growth
rate, not the individual Sharpe ratios, as they do not account
for the correlations between assets.
We close this section with a brief discussion of the relationship between growth, volatility and fractional Kelly portfolios.
These portfolios are known to offer an effective tradeoff
between long term growth and short term security according
to several measures ([27, 28]), but they are not known to offer
an optimal tradeoff. We now show that approximate fractional
Kelly portfolios do minimize a weighted combination of
approximate lost growth and return variance:

θ
Vθ (w) = rf + wT (µ − rf ) − wT Σw
2
as our approximation to expected utility. We then have that
G(w) ≈ V1 (w). As shown in Figure 1, the approximation is
empirically quite accurate for large cap stocks.
The Kelly portfolio weights w∗ are exactly equal to
−1
Σ (µ − rf ) when returns are normally distributed ([21]).
A simple derivative argument shows that this is approximately
true more generally:

This is equal to zero exactly when w = 2λ+1 w∗ as claimed.
The Hessian is positive deﬁnite for all w as long as λ > − 1 ,

so this point is a global minimum.

Proof: We have that w V1 (w) = µ − rf − Σw, and
˜

that w V1 (w∗ ) = 0. This implies immediately that w∗ =
Σ−1 (µ − rf ). 2 V1 (w) = −Σ, which is always negative

S HRINKAGE E STIMATORS
We now consider the more realistic case where the distribution of returns is unknown. We will exhibit a relationship
between estimated approximate fractional Kelly portfolios
and shrinkage estimators, and argue by simulation that this
connection explains the empirical success of fractional Kelly
portfolios.

[22] for Kelly bets.

Let µ denote the sample mean, and let Σ−1 denote the

w∗ = Σ−1 (µ − rf )

Proof: Our proof is adapted from a more general result
in [7], we provide a sketch. We are given an expression for
squared loss that depends upon a parameter α, and so we
perform standard derivative calculations to ﬁnd that
α∗ =

Standard asymptotics then allow us to conclude that

While estimation error is detrimental to portfolio selection
in general, there is strong evidence that errors in estimating
the mean return are much worse than errors in estimating
the variances or covariances (see [29] for a survey of the
relevant literature), and that overestimating the excess mean
return is signiﬁcantly worse than underestimating the same
quantity (see Section 7.3 of [21]). We should therefore expect
a portfolio formed from an improved estimator of the mean
to be superior to a portfolio formed from the sample mean.
The standard method of improving an estimator is to shrink it
toward some target, but the selection of an appropriate target is
an art in and of itself. Fortunately, we have been given an easy
prospective target: because the magnitude of the approximate
Kelly portfolio weights is driven by the difference µ − rf ,
ˆ
we can shrink µ towards rf to avoid over investment in any
particular asset.
We will form our portfolio from an estimator of the form

We see immediately that we could have selected the same
portfolio as an approximate fractional Kelly portfolio based on
the sample mean. We capture this observation in Theorem V.1:

Figure 2 shows the risks associated with these two portfolios
across 1000 trials. It is clear that the ﬁrst portfolio far
outperforms the second, even though the second is computed
from the true covariance matrix. In light of these results, we
assert that improved mean estimation is largely responsible for
the good empirical performance of partial Kelly portfolios.

Theorem V.1. The full Kelly portfolio formed from an estimaˆ
tor of the form αrf + (1 − α)µ with 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 is identical
ˆ
to the (1 − α)-Kelly portfolio formed from µ.

VI. C ONCLUSION AND O PEN P ROBLEMS

While it is not generally clear how we should choose among
fractional Kelly portfolios, we can always form shrinkage estimators by minimizing the expected squared distance from the
true parameter. Our next theorem gives an optimal shrinkage
procedure that we can use in portfolio selection:

In Theorem V.1, we have shown that the partial Kelly
portfolio formed from the sample mean is identical to the
full Kelly portfolio formed from a shrinkage estimator of the
population mean. In Theorem V.2 we have shown how to
optimally pick the proportion of wealth to be invested in the
Kelly strategy. While these results are noteworthy in and of
itself, there is an interesting idea here: every combination of
utility function and optimal portfolio implies parameters for
the market.
We have also shown a connection between Kelly portfolio
theory and several key concepts in modern portfolio theory.
Our approximate Kelly portfolios trace out the mean-variance
efﬁcient frontier, and grow at a rate which is closely tied
to a generalization of the Sharpe ratio. This last part is
compelling, as the Sharpe ratio is an intuitive measure of
portfolio performance, but has not been placed on a ﬁrm basis.

ˆ
Theorem V.2. Let µ denote the sample mean, and let
ˆ
α∗ = argmin E||µ − αrf − (1 − α)µ||
α∈[0,1]

Then under the assumption that the distribution of returns has
ﬁnite second moment, we have that

and we may estimate α∗ by

ˆ
ˆ
as claimed. µ and Σ are consistent estimators of µ and Σ
respectively, so if we plug them in to our formula for α∗ , we
receive a consistent estimator α∗ .
ˆ
The theory we have laid out in this section gives us reason
to believe that the empirical success of the fractional Kelly
strategy is due to its approximation of an improved mean
estimator. We close with a simulation that offers evidence
for this claim. We take the same set of returns as those used
in Figure 1, and consider portfolios formed from twenty-ﬁve
randomly selected stocks. We compute the growth lost due to
estimation error for two portfolios:

The approximate Kelly portfolio associated with this estimator

Improved Mean + Sample Covariance Matrix

We close with two open problems related to Kelly strategies
and shrinkage estimation. The ﬁrst relates to the role of covariance matrix shrinkage in portfolio selection. While estimation
error in the mean is the most important quantity to control, it
is clear that estimation error in the covariance matrix is also
detrimental, and as mentioned earlier, a large body of literature
exists which uses improved covariance matrix estimates to
construct improved portfolios. In future work we will extend
our theory to give insight as to how the estimated covariance
matrix should be shrunk.
The second corresponds to Kelly gambling. As in the
portfolio selection problem, we see an analogy between partial
Kelly strategies and shrinkage estimation of the gambler’s
edge. However, it is more difﬁcult to make this mathematically
precise because the third and higher moments of the returns
are not negligible as they are in daily stock prices.
