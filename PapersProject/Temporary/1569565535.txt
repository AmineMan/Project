1) increases linearly at a ﬁxed rate and
2) linearly depends on the link rates, until it reaches full
rank.
The implications are, because of property 1, ﬁxed allocation
corresponds to a ﬁxed throughput, thus memory of the system
becomes irrelevant. Because of property 2, the system scales in
time (doubling the rates doubles the throughput), thus we can
put systems of different rates in a common time frame through
proper scaling. These implications are so useful that, for the
above mentioned dynamical system, they enable the effective
use of the gradient method to construct a state feedback to
continuously steer the network towards a better allocation of
resource.
In what follows we ﬁrst brieﬂy recap the dynamical system
view of RNC that has been elaborated in [6]. The resource
allocation problem is then cast in this framework and a
gradient based resource allocation is proposed. We analyze its
optimality, convergence and discuss its practical design considerations. In the end we illustrate the use of the methodology by
designing an optimal power control algorithm for the wireless
network where nodes perform RNC.

Abstract—In the past decade, remarkable progress has been
made in the area of network coding in terms of theory, code
design, and applications. However, from a cross-layer perspective,
the understanding of resource allocation for random network
coding (RNC) and its impact on network throughput has been
limited. In this article we address the problem of resource
allocation for RNC in a general wireless network, using the recent
framework that models the dynamics of RNC using a system
of differential equations. Based on this framework, we design
a gradient algorithm that can be used to improve a variety of
throughput objectives.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Resource allocation for random network coding (RNC) aims
to ﬁnd an optimal allocation of communication resource, such
as power, bandwidth, time slots and codes, in support of
RNC based transport of information. The methodologies used
in the previous studies (e.g., [1], [2]) have a commonality
that, in one way or another the problem of coding at the
network level is reduced to the traditional commodity-ﬂow
[3] problem. For example, in a network where nodes perform
RNC, imposing a routing strategy may compromise valuable
beneﬁts of RNC because fundamentally RNC is different from
routing in exploiting various diversities the network offers.
Speciﬁcally, a routing strategy ﬁxes a set of routes over which
information is transported and this inevitably incurs loss on
the so called multicast advantage [1] of wireless. There are a
good number of other resource allocation methods tailored
for particular topologies or particular applications [4], [5].
These approaches lack generality and most of them only
superﬁcially make use of the advantages that RNC provides. In
our earlier work [6], a dynamical system model for RNC has
been proposed to completely characterize the average behavior
of rank evolution – a crucial concept of RNC – that contains
all information of interest regarding RNC, such as throughput
and decoding delay. While this makes plausible an optimal
control theoretic strategy, a simpler resource allocation based
on gradient methods also works well, as will be discussed in
this article. In general, due to the memory of a dynamical
system, gradient methods are often not available. The case of
RNC comes off as an exception because of two remarkable
properties that have been revealed in previous works [6]–[8].
Speciﬁcally, we know with ﬁxed MAC and PHY layer, i.e.,
ﬁxed resource allocation, the rank of any node (or set)

A. Dynamical System View of Random Network Coding
Consider a wireless network modeled as a hypergraph [6]
G = (N , E) where N is the set of transceiver nodes and
E are a collection of hyperarcs in the form of (i, K) pairs
where i ∈ N and K ⊂ N . The broadcasting phenomenon
from node i to an arbitrary set of nodes K is thus modeled
with the hyperarc K. We assume every node in the network
performs RNC on the ﬁnite ﬁeld GF(q) where q is the size of
the underlying ﬁnite ﬁeld. Whenever a node gets to transmit, it
transmits a coded packet that is a random linear combination of
all the packets available to it, including the packets it originates
and the coded packets it has received. Because RNC takes
packets as the atomic object to process, it represents a transport
strategy that is decoupled from the underlying MAC or PHY
technologies, whose operations are considered independent of
RNC. Take an arbitrary node i for example, typically the MAC
layer of node i determines the transmission (broadcast) rate
measured in packets per second. The PHY layer of node i
determines the error probability that a transmitted packet can
be correctly decoded at any receiver node j. In fact, according

1

B. Resource Allocation with the Dynamical System Model

to [6], the respective effect of MAC and PHY in a wireless
network can be shown through two variables:
• λi : the transmission rate at node i;
• Pi,K : the probability that a packet sent from node i can
be correctly decoded by at least one node in K.
It is possible to summarize the overall effect of MAC and
PHY by deﬁning zi,K = λi Pi,K , which can be conceived as
the capacity of the hyperarc (i, K). Given i ∈ Kc , we further
deﬁne the min cut capacity for (i, K) as
cmin (i, K) =

min

K⊂T ,i∈T

zj,T .

Since RNC is decoupled from MAC and PHY layers, it is
particularly easy to discuss resource allocation and its effect
on RNC at an abstract level. When there is a single resource to
be allocated to N nodes, the allocation scheme is represented
by a N -dimensional column vector r, whose i-th component
represents the allocation to node i. Consequently, the effect of
resource allocation is captured in the mapping
λi = λi (r)

˙
subject to V = f (V, z)
z = z(r)

(2)

˙
˙
r = g(V, V)

If we stack VK into a column vector V and stack all zi,K in
z, we may write (2) in a more compact form
˙
V = f (V, z)

i.e., the instantaneous throughput is almost a constant if m is
sufﬁciently large. The fact that when z is ﬁxed and m is large,
˙
V is constant can be written in a more compact form

While a problem of the form of (8) falls in the traditional
category of optimal control and is usually solved using calculus of variations, there are a few reasons that this approach
may not be appropriate. First, calculus of variations is as
computationally intensive as expensive, which can be practically prohibitive in wireless networks. Second, the wireless
communication environment can be dynamic (e.g., due to
fading or mobility), and may require certain adaptivity in the
devices. Fortunately, when we restrict our objective T to be a
function of throughputs, the special problem structure of RNC
can be utilized to derive a simple gradient based control which
is adaptive.

where JV f (V, z) is the Jacobian of f (V, z). Another useful
˙
observation from (2) is that VK only linearly depends on zi,K .
Mathematically, this implies
(Jz f )(V, z) = (Jz f )(V).

(9)
(10)

where g is some function of V. The second distinction is that
(8) is the ﬁrst formulation that takes full multicast advantage
of a wireless network, while previous formulations inevitably
break down the wireless transmission into independent links
to approximately convert the wireless network to a wired
network. Doing so, they lose a portion of the multicast
advantage.

where f is the stacking of the right-hand sides of (2). Note
˙
the instantaneous throughput of set K is given by VK . Suppose
node 1 is the only source node. When m → ∞, [6] showed
that
˙
VK (t) = cmin (1, K), when VK (t) < m,
(4)

(for large m)

(8)

Equation (8) takes a distinct form from previous resource
allocation problems for RNC. Rather than treating RNC as
a static transport strategy, (8) looks at it from the dynamical
system point of view, which means the allocation may also
be dynamic and changes over time. Moreover, it can take the
form of state feedback

i∈Kc

JV f (V, z) = 0,

(7)

or more concisely, zi,K = zi,K (r). In vector form, we may
write z = z(r).
An allocation scheme is invariably a deliberate design to
achieve a certain objective. In this article, we assume the
objective is a function of throughputs, which can be solved
with the system of differential equations in (2). Speciﬁcally,
we assume the objective to be maximized can be written as
˙
T (V) where T can be any continuous function in the ﬁrst
quadrant with partial derivatives deﬁned almost everywhere.
As a result, we wish to solve

As decodability of RNC entirely depends on the number of
linearly independent coding vectors, i.e., the rank, and as there
is no explicit routing, it is important to keep track of the rank
at any node. We use Vi to denote the rank at any node i. It
turns out to be useful that we also deﬁne the rank at any set K,
denoted by VK , as the number of linearly independent coding
vectors that the nodes in K collectively possess. Apparently Vi
and VK are random processes. Suppose the number of source
packets is m. Since every coded packet is a random linear
combination of m source packets, i can start decoding as
soon as Vi = m. In [6] the authors discussed a concentration
phenomenon of RNC, that when m is sufﬁciently large, Vi and
VK behave in a very predictable way, much like deterministic
functions of time. Such a concentration phenomenon has also
been observed and discussed even earlier in [8]. Its implication
triggers the conjecture that Vi and VK may be modeled as a
system of differential equations. This is indeed true and, when
MAC and PHY are ﬁxed such that zi,K are known parameters,
these equations are explicitly written down in [6] as
˙
VK =

and Pi,K = Pi,K (r),

(6)

While (6) is precise, (5) is a good approximation with large
m. Equations (5) and (6) constitute the basis for the resource
allocation strategy to be discussed.

Consider the objective function T (V) which can be any
function that has a gradient almost anywhere in the ﬁrst quad˙
rant. Our choice of feedback (see (11)) is g = ∇r T (V). Note
˙ because
without (13), it is not clear how to compute ∇r T (V)
˙
V is apparently affected by a number of factors including
topology, transmission rates and the coding operation. By
applying (2), the effect of the resource vector r is abstracted in
(10), the topology information encoded in the partially ordered
index K ⊂ N and the dynamism represented as the differential
operator. The system of equations in (2) thus allow us to ﬁnd
an expression for the feedback as1

Note (16) achieves equality when the feedback is chosen as
shown in (12).
Note Theorem 1 is true regardless whether T is concave or
whether T is monotonic. It is also true regardless whether z =
z(r) is concave or monotonic. Therefore it can be applied to a
wide range of problems. Theorem 1 is also true when T is non˙
differentiable on a null set since what really matters is T dt.
As a result, when we have multiple interested destinations
d1 , d2 , . . . ∈ D, an objective of the form

˙
r = aJr zJz f ∇V T
˙

can still be maximized with the chosen feedback. With Theorem 1, we immediately have
Corollary 1: If r is contained in a bounded set (i.e., ﬁnite
resource allocation), z(r) is continuous and T is continuous,
with the feedback in (12), T converges.
Proof: We have

˙
T (V) = min Vd

where ∇V T is the gradient of T (V), Jz f the Jacobian of
˙
f (V, z) with respect to z, Jr (z) the Jacobian of z(r). Note we
have introduced a > 0 as a feedback gain parameter. Combining (9) and (12) we have a closed-loop system that describes
the rank evolution with a dynamic resource allocation strategy

IV. A NALYSIS OF R ESOURCE A LLOCATION
In this section we will show that choosing the particular
feedback in the form of (12) most effectively improves the
objective function T . As we will see, the system of differential
equations in (2) not only facilitates design, but also analysis.
The main theorem is the following
Theorem 1: By introducing the feedback (12) in (13),
˙
˙
T ≥ 0. Among all possible feedback r = g such that
˙
g = aJr zJz f ∇V T , T is maximized by (12).
˙
˙
Proof: T ≥ 0 can be seen from the following computation

Proof: For rank evolution, we have

˙
V(t) = aVa (t/a)/a = f (Va (t/a), za (t/a))

˙

so
˙
|T | ≤ a(∇V T ) Jz f Jr z
˙

(18)

˙
V(t) = f 1/a (V, r),

Given any g such that g = aJr zJz f ∇V T , repeating
˙
the computation as shown in (14), we get
˙
T = a(∇V T ) Jz f Jr zg,
˙

zi,K .
i∈Kc

Because r is bounded, it is contained in a compact set.
˙
Therefore z is contained in a compact set and from (18) V
is contained in a compact set. Since T is continuous on this
compact set, T is also bounded. This implies that, if T is
monotonically increasing, it must converge.
˙
From (14) we see that T (the rate of convergence) can be
calculated if an expression is known for Jr (z). In the absence
of the exact knowledge of Jr (z), we also see the feedback
gain a can be used to speed up convergence. However, the
tradeoff is, with a too large we are at the risk of changing
z too fast thus invalidating (5). It remains to be answered
how different the solution and optimality will be if we vary
a without invalidating (5). The next theorem shows that the
solutions for V and r are basically the same except for a
proper scaling and the optimality is insensitive for a range of
a. This is generally not true when dealing with other dynamical
systems where different feedback gains lead to very different
trajectories. Before we proceed to the theorem, it would be
convenient to deﬁne f a to be the same as f , except that the
ﬁeld size q is replaced by q a .
Theorem 2: Let Va , ra , za satisfy (13) with an arbitrary
a > 0. Let V(t) = aVa (t/a), r(t) = ra (t/a) and z(t) =
za (t/a). Then V, r and z satisfy

Strictly speaking, the feedback in (12) is not a gradient of the
objective function T . It is nevertheless capable of continuously
computing the instantaneous resource vector r in the direction
that T improves.

assume z a , ra , V a are an arbitrary component of za , ra , Va ,
respectively. Then we have

In [6], a concentration result has been obtained regardless of q
as long as q is sufﬁciently large. In practice, the effect of ﬁnite
q on the concentration speed is minimal if q ≥ 2, because in
this case q −x → 0 quickly as x > 0 increases. Rank evolution
is therefore insensitive to a wide range of q, with which it
concentrates to the same solution. As a result, as long as q a
1, different a’s in (13) yield the same system

V. N UMERICAL E XAMPLE

t→∞

In this section, we use the network coding aware power
control as an example to demonstrate the performance of the
gradient based algorithm as shown in (13). Consider the 6node network shown in Fig. IV where nodes perform RNC on
GF(2) as described in Section II. Node 1 attempts to multicast
to nodes in D = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and we wish to maximize
the worst-case throughput in the network, i.e., maximize the
minimum throughput given in (17). We assume the MAC has
been ﬁxed so that node i (i = 1, . . . , 6) transmits at λi = 1
packet per millisecond. However, the transmit power of each
node can be ﬂexibly adjusted from 0 to 15dBm. The initial
transmit powers are set uniformly to 13dBm. Let PiTx denote
the transmit powers at node i, hji denote the link gains from
node i to node j, σ 2 = −101dBm denote the thermal noise
power at every receiver. We also associate with each node i

When choosing a, we want it to be large for fast convergence, but not so large that q 1/a ≈ 1 in (20). On the other
hand, we want to avoid making a so small that q a ≈ 1 in (23).
Both extremes would undermine the concentration assumption.
In general, concentration is essential for RNC to achieve the
throughput, and it is also the key assumption for what we have
discussed so far to remain valid. To do this, given the real ﬁeld
size q used, we may set a threshold q th < q below which the
concern for concentration will arise. Then pick a such that
q a , q 1/a ≥ q th ,

Note when T < 0, it must be true that a (∇V T ) Jz f Jr z 2 <

c, which can be regarded as the ﬁrst order stopping criteria.
Although Theorem 3 makes the choice of a even more
liberal, it is nevertheless advisable to choose a reasonably
small, otherwise additional nonlinearities may start to enter
the picture. This is especially true when we move from the
continuous system (13) to a discretized system that adjusts
resource allocation only at time instants it is triggered.

The packet error rate is given by Pji = 1 − (1 − Pji )L .
Assuming independent reception, we thus have

In this article we presented a new resource allocation
algorithm speciﬁcally designed for RNC and throughput based
objectives. Using the dynamical system model of RNC, the
algorithm evolves by introducing a gradient based state feedback. We proved that this feedback adaptively computes the
allocation that continuously improves the objective. We also
discussed convergence of the algorithm as well as design
considerations for the feedback gain. We illustrated the use
of the resource allocation methodology by designing power
control for maximizing minimum throughput in a multicast.

For the link gains, we use the ITU indoor attenuation model
[9] based on distance. The path loss PL over distance d is
given by

Using the model speciﬁed by (34) – (37), we execute (13)
to demonstrate our power control algorithm. Fig. 1b – 1c
show the throughputs as functions of time with a = 10, and
a = 0.1, respectively, in addition to throughputs achieved
without power control. With a = 10, the minimum throughput
T (the lower envelop of all the curves) increases quickly.
But as z changes too fast, (5) becomes invalid and leads
to oscillation of the trajectory of T . Lowering a results in
a smoother trajectory with slower convergence. However, in
both settings, T eventually achieves the the same value of 1
packet per millisecond. Considering the transmit rate of node
1 (the source) is also 1 packet per millisecond, the gradient
based resource allocation has achieved the maximum possible
objective without giving up any multicast advantage and also
showed signiﬁcant improvement over no power control.
