current channel realization allows it. This situation of variable
recovered information bits over a ﬁxed block length, obey to
the variable-to-ﬁx coding coined and characterized by [4]. The
broadcast approach may achieve higher expected rates, and
was partially characterized for multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) fading channels in [3] and [5].

Abstract—This work considers the problem of transmitting two
streams with different delay constraints over a single input single
output slowly ﬂat fading channel, where only the receiver has
perfect channel state information (CSI). One stream has stringent
delay constraints, while the other stream has a relaxed delay
constraint. This is modeled by a block fading channel for the
ﬁrst stream, where a broadcast approach is employed. The second
stream is encoded over a longer block and views an ergodic fading
channel. Several encoding and decoding strategies are considered.
In all cases the delay constrained stream is decoded in presence
of the other stream, which can be decoded only after its long
codeword is fully received. The non-delay constrained part is
decoded after canceling out the ﬁrst stream from the received
signal. We derive here a closed form solution for the optimal
layering power distribution, which maximizes the expected sumrate, where the layering is employed on the delay constrained
stream.

The works [6] and [7] examined the mixed requirement of
having two streams of data. One stream is delay constrained
(DC), and the other is Non Delay Constrained (NDC), achieving the channel ergodicity. [6] assumed single user MIMO with
perfect CSI at receiver and transmitter, while [7] extended this
to a multiuser MIMO Broadcast setting. These works focused
on a MIMO setting and different streams were assigned to
separate channel groups.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this work the DC and NDC streams are transmitted over
a single input single output (SISO) channel, with no transmit
CSI adhering to the broadcast approach for the DC stream.
Three overall strategies are suggested, trying to maximize the
expected sum rate. Their achievability region over DC and
NDC is examined. The DC is always decoded in presence
of the NDC stream, treated as interference. However, before
decoding the NDC stream, the decodable DC layers can
be removed and allow NDC decoding at highest signal to
interference and noise ratio (SINR). A closed-form solution of
the sum-rate maximization problem is obtained for the outage
and broadcast DC stream in parallel to a single NDC layer. In
addition, an NDC layering is introduced and its maximization
problem is represented. It is shown that the optimal power
distribution for the broadcast approach reduces to the easy-toimplement outage approach in certain conditions. Furthermore,
for high SNRs the sum rate is tight to the ergodic capacity
bound, and in this case the DC rate is limited to a constant
value while the NDC compensates on the gap to ergodic
capacity.

Many wireless applications have to cope with transmission of different types of information, which have different
priorities. In such case it may be convenient to impose a
delay constraint according to the application requirement.
For example, a voice communication might not be delay
tolerant, while data communications may usually have relaxed
delay requirements. Typical delay limited transmissions over
a wireless fading channel experience a block fading channel,
where the fading realization may vary between transmission
blocks. Due to channel variability the transmitter has no access
to channel state information (CSI), while receiver has perfect
CSI.
Under a relaxed delay constraint and long codewords, the
transmission experiences multiple fading realizations, which
in the limit may achieve the ergodic capacity [1]. Under
stringent delay constraints the achievable rate degrades since
the transmitter can not foresee the channel realization, and
must use a ﬁxed rate. One approach that can be used is
known as the Outage Approach [1], where the transmitter
sends a single layer encoded stream. When channel conditions
allow, receiver reliably decodes the codeword. Otherwise, the
decoder declares an outage and the current transmission is
rescinded. Another approach is a reﬁnement of the former,
known as the Broadcast Approach [2], [3]. The transmission
is encoded in multiple ordered layers, each layer is destined to
a matched receiver layer. The transmitter virtually broadcasts
all layers, and the receiver can decode as much layers as the

The structure of the document is as follows. Section II formulates the problem and gives some preliminaries. Section III
describes DC-Layering with single NDC layer. Optimality for
this case is represented at Section IV. Adding to the scheme
NDC layering can be found at Section V. Numerical Results
are in Section VI, followed by conclusions at Section VII.
Throughout the paper proofs are outlined due to space limitations. Full details can be found at [8].

II. F ORMULATION AND P RELIMINARIES
Consider the single user SISO channel
√
Yi = Si ·Xi + Ni ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , ∞

III. DC-L AYERING
The superposition of DC and NDC is employed by allocating a ﬁxed amount of power per stream. Denote the DC
relative power portion as β ∈ [0, 1], that is β · P is the
power allocated for the DC stream and the rest (1 − β)·P for
the NDC stream. The DC part uses the broadcast approach.
During decoding of the DC part the NDC is treated as
additional interference, since during the decoding of each DC
block the NDC codeword cannot be completely received, and
thus cannot be decoded nor reconstructed to assist the DC
decoding. The NDC decoder is informed of all DC decoded
layers per DC codeword and cancels out the decoded part from
the corresponding NDC block, maximizing its SINR for NDC
decoding.
By designing the two encoders like described earlier, we
can justify that both DC and NDC parts communicate over a
ﬂat fading channel with additive Gaussian noise. The imposed
noise for each part consists of the white channel noise along
with undecodable codewords of those which are undecoded
yet from both parts.
The DC encoder uses superposition of inﬁnite number of
layers, ordered by means of channel fading realization s in
a manner that forms a degraded broadcast channel. Per DC
message, the transmitted codeword of length L is by

(1)

where {Yi } are complex samples of the received symbols,
{Xi } are the transmitted complex symbols, and {Ni } are the
additive circular symmetric complex normal noise samples,
i.i.d by (0, 1). Si ∈ R+ is the random fading power, which
is known only to the decoder. We assume it changes slowly.
Without loss of generality, its mean will be normalized, that
is ES = 1. The average power at the encoder output is
2
constrained to quantity P ≡ SNR, that is E |Xi | ≤ P .
Notations: For a random variable S, we let FS (s) =
Pr{S ≤ s} be the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of S
d
and fS (s) = ds FS (s) be the probability distribution function
b
(pdf). For some two real values satisfying a < b, let [x]a be
the truncated version of x with respect to the section [a, b],
b
that is [x]a = max {min {x, b} , a}.
The joint strategy of accessing both DC and NDC parts on a
single channel uses a two level block nesting. Every L samples
deﬁne a block for the DC stream, while the NDC stream is
encoded over K such blocks, consisting of L·K samples. The
NDC block is called a super block. L is large enough for
reliable communication for the DC part, but is much shorter
than the dynamics of the slow fading process. K is large
enough for enabling the empirical distribution of the fading
coefﬁcient be similar to the real one. Two independent streams
of information are encoded. The DC stream is decoded at the
completion of each block at the decoder, at a rate dependent
upon the realization of the channel fading coefﬁcient for that
block. The NDC stream is decoded only at the completion of
the super block. All of the following proposed schemes assume
superposition coding, equivalent to symbol-wise additivity of
the DC and NDC codeletters. Denote by W L the L-length
codeword for the DC code for each block, and Z KL the KLlength codeword for the NDC code for each super block. By
focusing on one super block and re-indexing (1) we get
√
Yk,i = Sk ·(Wk,i + Zk,i ) + Nk,i ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , L ; k = 1, 2, . . . , K

Designate ρ(s) to be the DC layering power distribution,
which will be optimized later on, and each layer communication scheme will try to overcome a Gaussian channel where
the fading is known to both sides.
The NDC encoder sends a single message through block of
length L·K. By random coding over a Gaussian channel, the
codewords can be generated. A total of eL·K·RN DC codewords
can be used, where the channel rate RN DC relies on the
optimized channel power ρ(s) as well.
The decoders are activated by order. First, the DC decoder
works on every L-block and by successive decoding can reveal
as many layer as the channel permits. It is similar to the
classic broadcast approach, except all layers suffer from an
undecodable (at this stage) interference.
All DC decoders’ outputs are fed to the NDC decoder,
which works after K such blocks. After cleaning up per block
the decodable DC codewords, the NDC part is decoded with
minimal residual interference.
Calculating the DC rate in presence of NDC is a direct
extension of [3], which is a special case for β = 1. Deﬁne the
DC interference for a fading power s as I(s), implying

where the double sub-index {k, i} is equivalent to the time
index (k − 1) · L + i. Note that slow fading channel nature
was used by deﬁning Sk,i = Sk . This scheme reﬂects a
2
power constraint of the form E |Wk,i + Zk,i | ≤ P . Denote
RDC (s) as the achievable rate for a fading power realization
s per block. The total expected DC rate over all fading power
realizations is by

Let RN DC designates the rate of the NDC part, which
experiences enough such realizations over the communication.
When relaxing the stringent delay constraint, coding over
sufﬁcient large blocks can emerge rate of the Ergodic Capacity, deﬁned by Cerg = ES [log (1 + SP )]. Clearly, for any
scheme RDC + RN DC ≤ Cerg .

prior to the communication. sth may be interpreted as the
fading gain threshold for single layer coding. The advantages
of this approach are low implementation complexity and ease
of analysis. The disadvantage is its sub-optimality. The outage
approach is designed for a channel with ﬁxed fading of sth .
On the one hand, if s ≥ sth , the message can be transmitted
errorfree in a rate adjusted for sth . On the other hand, if
s < sth , the speciﬁc transmission is useless.

cases to come differ in constructing I(s) or splitting the NDC

Proof: (Outlined) By explicitly describing RDC,o (s) and
RN DC,o (s) and averaging, (8) can be changed to depend on
some scalar sth ≥ 0 rather then any I(s). Seeking when the
derivative is zero results in (11).
B. DC Broadcast Approach
Maximization of (8) can be derived analytically by developing an E¨ ler Equation in a similar way to [3]. This is done by
u
enlarging the class of admissible functions I(s) (as opposed
to the outage approach) to be continuously differentiable and
satisfy the boundary conditions I(0) = βP , I(∞) = 0.

IV. O PTIMAL DC-L AYERING
In this section the optimal layering power distribution ρ(s),
which maximizes the expected sum rate, is derived. The
sum rate refers to the sum of (RDC , RN DC ) as stated in
(6) and (7), respectively. It is a function deﬁned over a
continuum, and depends on I(s) according to (5). Speciﬁcally,
the optimization problem is
I ∗ (s) = argmax {RDC + RN DC }

Proposition 2 (Joint Optimality by Broadcast DC). The maximizer Ibs (s) of (8) when considering all continuously differ˜ βP
entiable boundary conditioned functions is Ibs (s) = [I(s)]0 ,
where

b(x) = 2(1 − β)P fS (x)x2 − (1 − FS (x))

A. DC Outage Approach

The associated rates RDC,bs and RN DC,bs can be achieved
by placing it in (6) and (7).

The outage approach is a simple special case of layering,
where a single DC coded layer is used. In this case, the power
distribution I(s) is explicitly given by
{
βP if 0 ≤ s ≤ sth
I(s) =
(9)
0
if s > sth .
ρ(s) = βP ·δ(s − sth ).

(15)
(16)

Remark 2 (On possible discontinuity of I(s)). The square
˜
root at (14) can impose a ﬁnite length domain for I(s), that
can result in discontinuity of I(s). This situation is addressed
by assigning a Dirac function at ρ(s), which can be interpreted
as a superposition of single layer coding and continuous
layering.

(10)

Proof: (Outlined for Proposition 2) Explicitly obtain the
functional S(x, I(x), I ′∫
(x)) upon which the target function
∞
of (8) is of the form 0 S(x, I(x), I ′ (x)) dx, where I ′ (x)
is the derivative of I(s). By [9], a necessary condition for
an extremum is given by the corresponding E¨ ler-Lagrange
u
d
equation, i.e. SI − dx SI ′ = 0. For our case it boils down to a
˜
quadratic equation, which has a feasible root I(x) as in (14).
The truncation is an outcome of an adaption to the physical
meaning of it as a residual interference.

This proposition is given here without a proof. Further
details on its derivation may be found in [8].
Remark 3. The optimization problem is rather general, having freedom in choosing I(S) and Λ(a). The DC Rate is
independent of Λ(a) since it sees all of it as noise, encouraging
us to ﬁnd optimality of DC rate over I(S), and only then to
ﬁnd the optimal Λ(a) that maximizes (18).

V. DC-L AYERING AND NDC-L AYERING

This section demonstrates the expected sum rate results
for the Rayleigh ﬂat channel. That is, the random variable
fading power S is exponentially distributed with fS (s) =
e−s , FS (s) = 1 − e−s , s ≥ 0.
The outage approach rates for a Rayleigh fading channel
can be obtained by substituting the pdf and cdf at (12) and
(13).
For the broadcast approach, (14) reduces to

Additional gain can be achieved by forming the NDC part
as the sum of several layers, each is decoded at different stage.
The main idea here is to successively decode the NDC part
by jointly decoding residual DC layers, which were originally
undecodable on the DC trail. Further decoding of DC layer
clearly does not contribute to the expected DC rate, as the DC
part is not delay tolerant. However, the NDC decoder may
increase its efﬁciency by removing more and more residual
interference of the DC part after each NDC layer decoding.

Explicit expressions for the RDC,bs and RN DC,bs were derived. They are split over three possible cases and are not
shown here due to space limitations.
Fig. 1 shows the relation of RDC + RN DC for the joint
outage approach and the joint broadcast approach, for selected
values of β. The total expected sum-rate is the sum of the DC
rate and the NDC rate, which are presented separately on Fig. 2
and Fig. 3, respectively.

q=1 E Zq
L
Gaussian distributed, in each stage an additive Gaussian noise
is at presence, each time compound from the undecoded
codewords. The DC part is decoded in ”real time”. At the
completion of a super-block, the decoder removes the impact
of the decoded DC codewords. In this stage NDC layers with
index greater than or equals 2 play a roll of noise. After
canceling the ﬁrst NDC layer, it feeds back DC decoder
which now sees less interference at each block. Although it
is DC decoding, it is useless for the DC part due to the high
latency it imposes. After reliably decoding more DC layers, it
can decode another NDC layer. These last two steps can be
iteratively repeated, until reaching the last NDC layer.
Exploring the total beneﬁt that can be obtained of such
scheme is of interest. To do so, a continuum of decoding stages
are deﬁned. The next proposition describes the optimization
problem, however it does not seem to lend itself to a closed
form solution. Recall only RN DC,bs can be beneﬁcial, since
all decoding stages are irrelevant for DC part.

Remark 4 (On the ﬁnite limit of RDC,bs ). For high SNRs and
a ﬁxed β < 1, the NDC rate and the ergodic capacity have
the same slope. By analytical calculation, limP →∞ RDC,bs =
−log (1 − β), for β < 1 as Fig. 2 shows.
2
This ﬁnding is intuition consistent. Inﬁnite high SNR should
give inﬁnite rate for the classic channel, whereas the DC
scheme tries to overcome the NDC as well. When SNR is high
enough, the DC channel suffers from high NDC noise. As for
the NDC decoding, it takes place after DC part is revealed,
leading to unlimited rate.
Remark 5 (On the Optimal DC Layering Power Distribution).
1
For β < 2 and P ≥ 4(1 − β)/(1 − 2β)2 , the optimal DC
layering power distribution reduces to the single layer, that
is the outage approach. In order to proﬁt from the broadcast
approach, the power should be asymmetric in favor for the
DC (β → 1).

The Achievability region for the single layer NDC at a ﬁxed

The NDC multi layering scheme is too general. Closed
form optimal expressions could not be found even for the
NDC 2-Layer (one degree of freedom in Λ(a), where the
I(s) was suited solely for DC). By numerical observations, the
NDC rate increased by a negligible amount for the numerical
optimal Λ(a) at the 2-Layers NDC coding.

This paper extends the broadcast approach to the channel
model including simultaneous transmission of streams with a
mixture of delay constrains. Several schemes were suggested,
and analyzed for the SISO ﬂat fading channel. The broadcast
approach is superior over the outage only in certain situations
under the proposed schemes. This paper focuses on uncooperative encoders in parallel to cooperative decoders, whereas
the work in [8] also extends the scheme and uses Dirty Paper
Coding for the DC part in order to overcome the known
non-causal NDC codeword at the role of interference. It also
addresses the rate region (RDC , RN DC ), rather than merely
focusing on the sum rate optimization as in this paper.
