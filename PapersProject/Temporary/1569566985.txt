Abstract— Many communication channels are reasonably modeled
to be impaired by additive noise. Recent studies suggest that many of
these channels are affected by additive noise that is best explained
by alpha-stable statistics.
We study in this work such channel models and we characterize
the capacity-achieving input distribution for those channels under
fractional order moment constraints. We prove that the optimal input
is necessarily discrete with a compact support for all such channels.
Interestingly, if the second moment is viewed as a measure of
power, even when the channel input is allowed to have inﬁnite second
moment, the optimal one is found to have ﬁnite power.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In modeling the noise effect in a communication channel, it
is common to assume that the noise is additive and Gaussian
distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem which in layman
terms states that, if the noise is due to multiple independent
sources, then their cumulative effect is asymptotically Gaussian distributed.
Recent studies however suggest that in some circumstances,
the additive noise is better explained by non-Gaussian statistics
as is the case when modeling the multiuser interference in
a network [1], [2]. This was also observed in the context
of modeling the Radio-Frequency interference in embedded
wireless laptop transceivers [3]. In both setups, the noise was
found to be better modeled as a Symmetric Alpha-Stable
(SαS ) random variable.
This noise model poses multiple challenges to system
designers and we intend to address one of them in this work:
• Despite the fact that the Probability Density Function
(PDF) of a SαS random variable was proven to exist and
exhibit rather “nice” properties, no closed-form expression is known except in two special cases: the Cauchy
and the Gaussian ones.
• Such noise distributions have inﬁnite variance, which
implies that the received signal has potentially inﬁnite
power and any analysis that is based on a Hilbert space
approach is not valid anymore.
The “classical” signal processing techniques used in
receiver design are hence not necessarily applicable, let
alone optimal.
• The channel capacity of a basic linear channel where the
output is simply a noisy version of the input is not known
and optimal signaling schemes are not known either. A
few attempts were made along this direction and as far
This work was supported by AUB’s University Research Board.

as the authors know, only numerical evaluation of some
achievable rates have been conducted [4], [5]. In this
work, we attempt to partially answer these questions.
Earlier information theoretic studies of linear channels under general additive non-Gaussian noise have been conducted
as in [6], [7]. However, typically these studies either require
a ﬁnite noise variance which is not the case in this model, or
impose a peak input power condition, a constraint that we will
not impose in this work. It is worth noting as well that, it is
not clear whether the SαS noise model ﬁts within the general
categories described in [7].
In this paper, we study the additive linear channel model,
where a SαS noise variable is added to the input that is
generally constrained to satisfy a fractional r-th order moment
constraint: E [|X|r ] ≤ a, for any real value of r > 1. Clearly,
the average power constrained channel is a special case of our
setup. More importantly, if r is chosen to be less than 2, then
the input is technically allowed to have inﬁnite power similarly
to the noise and the received signal: a primary motivation
behind this particular choice of the input constraint. Since
the received signal is of inﬁnite power, and if a transceiver’s
hardware is capable of coping with such a received signal,
then it should be able to cope with a similar transmitted one.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We ﬁrst
describe the channel model in Section II and derive a lower
bound on the output PDF in Section III. Our main results are
presented in Section IV, and Section V concludes the paper.
Two Appendices I and II establish useful technical lemmas.
II. C HANNEL MODEL
We consider the real linear discrete-time memoryless channel:
Y = X + N,
(1)
where Y is the channel output and X is its input which
is subject to the fractional r-th order moment constraint:
E [|X|r ] ≤ a for some real-valued r > 1 and a > 0. The
additive noise variable N , which is independent of the input,
is assumed to behave statistically as an alpha-stable Random
Variable (RV) whose characteristic function is deﬁned by:
α

Φ(ω) = eiγω−|cω| ,
where α ∈ [1, 2), c > 0 and γ ∈ R. We note ﬁrst that, from an
information theoretic perspective, assuming the values γ = 0
and c = 1, does not affect the generality of the problem since

it relates to the equivalent channel where the output is scaled
(Y − γ)/c. Henceforth we assume that the noise, the PDF of
which is pN (·), is a standard SαS RV whose characteristic
α
function is e−|ω| .
For additive channels with absolutely continuous noise, the
output PDF exists [8]. We denote by pY (y) = p(y; F )† the
output density induced by an input probability distribution
function F . Note that, for α ∈ [1, 2),
pN (n) ≤

(2)

4kα
where g(n) = α sin( πα )Γ(α)|n|−(α+1) = |n|α+1 .

Additionally, alpha-stable distribution functions are known
to be analytic on R whenever α ∈ [1, 2) [10, p.183 Sec.36].
Whenever α > 1 the radius of convergence is ∞ and is no
less than one if α = 1. Hence, if Sδ = {z ∈ C : |ℑ(z)| < δ},
pN (·) is analytically extendable over Sδ for δ small enough.
Moreover, we prove in Appendix I the following novel bound:
there exists κ > 0 and n2 > 0 such that

∀ z ∈ Sδ : |ℜ(z)| ≥ n2 ,

(3)

which we use to establish Lemma 2 in Appendix II. In the
remainder of this paper, we ﬁx ǫ and a small enough δ, and
we deﬁne n0 = max{n1 , n2 } where n1 and n2 are as above.

output PDF pY (y) of channel (1) is lowerbounded by

Proof: First note that the statement of this lemma does
not hold for all inputs in the Gaussian case. The derivations of

In order to study the capacity of channel (1) and characterize
its achieving input, we derive in this section a lower bound
on the output PDF.
It is known that alpha-stable distributions possess heavy tails
that decay asymptotically as power laws. More speciﬁcally [9,

of Markov’s inequality and the r-th moment constraint.
IV. M AIN R ESULT
In the following we state and prove the main theorem of
this paper
Theorem. The capacity achieving input of channel (1), whenever r > 1 and α ∈ [1, 2) is compactly supported, discrete
with no accumulation point except possibly at zero.
Proof: With the sufﬁcient topological and functional
requirements satisﬁed, we proceed as in [8] and we write the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions as being necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions for the unique optimal input to satisfy.
These conditions state that an input random variable X ∗ with
Cumulative Distribution Function F ∗ achieves the capacity C
of an r-th moment constrained channel if and only if there
exists ν ≥ 0 such that,
pN (y − x) ln p(y; F ∗ ) dy ≥ 0, (6)

ν(|x|r − a) + C + H +

for all x ∈ R, with equality if x is a point of increase of F ∗ . H
is the entropy of the noise and is ﬁnite by virtue of equation (2)
along with the continuity of pN (·). Assume that the points of
increase of F ∗ have a positive accumulation point and let
s(z) = ν(z r − a) + C + H +

pN (y − z) ln p(y; F ∗ ) dy.

The function s(z) is analytic on Sδ \R− by virtue of Lemma 2
proven in Appendix II and by using for z r the principal
branch of the logarithm [11, p.85 Prop.1.6.4]. Since s(z) has
accumulating zeros on the positive real axis, by the identity
theorem [12], s(·) is identically null on Sδ \ R− . Therefore,
ν(xr − a) + C + H = −

pN (y) ln p(y − x; F ∗ ) dy, (7)

for all x ∈ R+ . Examining the integral, let

Pr(N > x − y0 ) ∼ 4kα (x − y0 )−α as x → ∞ [9, Th.1.12,

where the maximum exists and is positive since pY (y) is
continuous and 0 < pY (y) < 1. I2 is also o(|x|r ) and hence
t(x) = o(xr ) for which equation (7) is impossible unless
ν = 0 which is non-sensible since the constraint is biding, and
can be formally ruled out [13]. This leads to a contradiction
and rules out the assumption of having a positive accumulation
point. Similarly, we rule out a negative accumulation point
and in conclusion, the set of points of increase of F ∗ has no
accumulation point except possibly at 0.

However, LHS(xi ) = 0 for all points of increase xi . If these
were arbitrarily large, then ν will be zero which is not possible.
V. C ONCLUSION
We studied the channel capacity and the capacity-achieving
input distributions for channels affected by SαS additive noise.
We proved that the optimal input is discrete and compactly
supported for any fractional order input moment constraint
larger than one. We note that, even when imposing a fractional
lower order moment constraint on the input and allowing it to
be potentially of inﬁnite variance, since the optimal input is
compactly supported, its variance is nevertheless ﬁnite. This
indicates that over these types of channels, surprisingly, it
does not increase the rates to transmit with inﬁnite power.
We acknowledge that measuring the power of a signal via the
second moment might not be adequate in this context.
We also note that the methodology developed in this paper
may be readily used for Pareto distributions.
Finally, the results may be readily generalized for non-linear
channels of the form Y = sgn(X)|X|s + N , where N is a
SαS noise random variable, and where the input is subject to
E [|X|t ] ≤ a, t > s. An appropriate change of variable as
in [14] yields readily a similar result.
A PPENDIX I
We study in this appendix the rate of decay of standard
SαS distributions with α ∈ [1, 2) on the horizontal strip
S = {z ∈ C : |ℑ(z)| < 1}. We prove that |pN (z)| =
1
O |ℜ(z)|α+1 , for z ∈ S as |ℜ(z)| → ∞‡ .
1 1
For the case α = 1, pN (z) = π 1+z2 which clearly satisﬁes
our assertion. When α > 1, pN (·) can be formally extended
on C as:
∞

pN (z) =

n=0

Having ruled out the possibility that an optimal distribution
has a set of points of increase with a non-zero accumulation
point, we can immediately conclude that this set is countable
on R by virtue of the fact that R is Lindel¨ f, and X ∗ is
o
discrete. Denoting by {xi }i≥0 the points of increase of F ∗ (x)
and pi = Pr(X = xi ) > 0, the output probability density can
be lowerbounded by pY (y) > pi p(y|xi ), ∀y ∈ R; ∀i ≥ 0.
Examining the last term in the Left-Hand Side (LHS) of the
KKT condition (6), it can be proven to be o(|x|r ) as in the
preceding section. Hence, the LHS of (6), LHS(x) = ν|x|r +
o(|x|r ) diverges to inﬁnity as |x| goes to inﬁnity for any ν > 0.

In this appendix we prove the analyticity of the integral
function on a strip around the real axis.
Lemma 2. The function i(·; F ) : Sδ → C deﬁned by:
∞

z → i(z; F ) = −

−∞

pN (y − z) ln p(y; F ) dy,

is analytic over Sδ , for all F such that

(16)

|x|r dF (x) ≤ a.

Proof: To prove this lemma, we will make use of
Morera’s theorem:
a) We start ﬁrst by proving the continuity of i(·; F ) on Sδ .
In fact, let z0 ∈ Sδ , ρ > 0. and z ∈ Sδ such that |z − z0 | ≤ ρ,
lim i(z; F ) = − lim

z→z0

z→z0

=−
=−

pN (y − z) ln p(y; F ) dy

lim pN (y − z) ln p(y; F ) dy

z→z0

(17)

pN (y − z0 ) ln p(y; F )dy = i(z0 ; F ).

Equation (18) is justiﬁed by pN (y − z) being a continuous
function of z on Sδ , and (17) by DCT. Indeed, in what follows
we ﬁnd an integrable function r(y) such that,
pN (y − z) ln p(y; F ) = − pN (y − z) ln p(y; F ) ≤ r(y),
for all z ∈ Sδ such that |z − z0 | ≤ ρ and for all y ∈ R.
Using (3), we upperbound ﬁrst |pN (y − z)|. For z ∈ Sδ
such that |z − z0 | ≤ ρ and y ≤ −(n0 + |ℜ(z0 )| + ρ), then
y ≤ −n0 + ℜ(z0 ) − ρ and

pN (y − z) ≤

M = max

Note that M is ﬁnite since the maximization of pN (·) is taken
over a compact set that is included in Sδ where it is analytic,
and 0 < M1 < 1 since py (·) is positive and continuous. The
fact that r(y) is integrable concludes the proof of continuity
of i(z; F ).
b) To continue the proof of analyticity, we need to integrate
i(·; F ) on the boundary ∂∆ of a compact triangle ∆ ⊂ Sδ .
We denote by |∆| its perimeter, η0 = minz∈∂∆ ℜ(z), η1 =
maxz∈∂∆ ℜ(z) and φ = max{n0 + max{|η0 |, |η1 |}, n0 +
1
(2a) r }. By similar arguments as above and using the fact that
pN (·) is analytic on Sδ one can prove that ∂∆ i(z; F )dz =
0, which in addition to the continuity of i(·; F ) insure its
analyticity on Sδ by applying Morera’s theorem.
