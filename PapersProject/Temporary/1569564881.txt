It has been shown that complete sets of MUBs are equivalent to orthogonal decompositions of the Lie algebra sln (C)
[4], however ﬁnding orthogonal decompositions of Lie algebras is as difﬁcult a task as ﬁnding sets of MUBs. Some
work has been done classifying Lie Algebras using projective
geometry [15], but these results have as yet not been applied
to decompositions of sln (C).
Some sets of MUBs have been show to have an Abelian
group structure [10], [13]. We go further by showing that some
complete sets of MUBs may be regarded as submodules of
the appropriate free module, and as subspaces of a projective
geometry over that module.

Abstract—Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) have been used in
several cryptographic and communications applications. There
has been much speculation regarding connections between MUBs
and ﬁnite geometries. Most of which has focused on a connection
with projective and afﬁne planes. We propose a connection
with higher dimensional projective geometries and projective
Hjelmslev geometries. We show that this proposed geometric
structure is present in several constructions of MUBs.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a structure ﬁrst deﬁned in a quantum physics context in 1960 [22]. Since then
MUBs have been used in quantum key distribution protocols
[3], [21], and can be used to construct signal sets for communications systems [1], [7].
A basis for Cd is orthonormal if all basis vectors are
orthogonal and of unit length. Two orthonormal bases B0 and
B1 in Cd are called mutually unbiased if | φ|ψ |2 = 1/d for
all φ ∈ B0 and ψ ∈ B1 .
The maximum number of mutually unbiased bases in Cd
is d + 1 [26]. A set of d + 1 MUBs is called complete,
it is complete sets of MUBs that are of most use in the
communications applications. While constructions of complete
sets of MUBs in Cd are known when d is a prime power [26],
it is unknown if such complete sets exist in non-prime power
dimensions.
There has been much speculation regarding connections
between MUBs and ﬁnite geometries [2], [19], [20], [25]. Most
of this has focused on a connection with projective and afﬁne
planes.
The evidence for connections between MUBs and ﬁnite
geometries falls into two categories: counting arguments [19],
[20], and structures which construct both MUBs and ﬁnite
geometries. These structures include planar functions [12],
[18], symplectic spreads [11] as well as speciﬁc afﬁne planes
[8], [17].
We investigate higher dimensional projective geometries
and show that some sets of MUBs may be regarded as
subspaces. Note that in order for these higher order projective
geometries to exist, a projective plane of the appropriate size
must also exist. If all MUBs are subspaces of larger projective
geometries, then a connection between MUBs and projective
planes would be proven. Alas we do not go so far.

II. P RELIMINARIES
A. Constructions of MUBs
We investigate three non-equivalent constructions of MUBs.
This ﬁrst construction is based on planar functions over a ﬁnite
ﬁeld. For more on planar functions see for example [5]. Let
2iπ
ωp = e p .
Theorem 1 (Planar function construction): [18, Thm 4.1]
Let Fq be a ﬁeld of odd characteristic p. Let Π(x) be a planar
function on Fq . Let Va = {vab : b ∈ Fq } be the set of vectors
1
tr
vab = √ ωp (aΠ(x)+bx)
q

x∈Fq

(1)

with a, b ∈ Fq . The standard basis E along with the sets Va ,
a ∈ Fq , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in Cq .
The following construction has been shown to be equivalent
to the planar function construction when using Π(x) = x2
[9]. We highlight it as the submodule and subspaces structure
appear in a different way to the planar function construction.
Theorem 2 (Alltop Construction): [1] [12, Thm 1] Let Fq
be a ﬁnite ﬁeld of odd characteristic p ≥ 5. Let Va = {vab :
b ∈ Fq } be the set of vectors
3
1
tr
vab = √ ωp ((x+a) +b(x+a))
q

x∈Fq

(2)

with a, b ∈ Fq . The standard basis E along with the sets Va ,
a ∈ Fq , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in Cq .
The next construction stems from a symplectic spread.

Theorem 3: [11, 3.5(b)] Let Fpn be a ﬁeld of odd characteristic p, with n odd. Let s and n be coprime, such that
s < n/2. Let Va = {vab : b ∈ Fq } be the set of vectors

C. Geometric Structures
The geometric structures we are investigating are projective
geometries, P G(d − 1, q), deﬁned over a ﬁnite ﬁeld and projective Hjelmslev geometries P HG(d − 1, GR(4, 1)), deﬁned
over a Galois ring.
Let M be an R module that is a submodule of Rd . If R
is a ﬁeld, then any submodule is a subspace of Rd . If R is a
Galois ring then any free submodule is a subspace of Rd [14].
Deﬁnition 6: The projective geometry constructed from Fq ,
P G(d − 1, q) is the set of subspaces of Fd . x is a point of
q
P G(d − 1, q) and represents all vectors ρx in Fd such that
q
ρ ∈ F∗ and at least one of the entries of x is non-zero.
q
Deﬁnition 7: [23] The projective Hjelmslev geometry constructed from GR(4, 1), P HG(d − 1, GR(4, 1)) is the set
of subspaces of GR(4, 1)d . x is a point of P HG(d −
1, GR(4, 1)) and represents all vectors ρx in GR(4, 1)d such
that ρ is a unit of GR(4, 1) and at least one of the entries of
x is a unit of GR(4, 1).
Note that P G(d − 1, q) ∼ P HG(d − 1, Fq ).
=

x∈Fq

with a, b ∈ Fq . The standard basis E along with the sets Va ,
a ∈ Fq , form a complete set of q + 1 MUBs in Cq .
The next construction uses Galois rings.
Theorem 4 (Galois ring construction): [12, Thm 3] Let
GR(4, n) be Galois ring of characteristic 4 and Teichm¨ ller
u
√
set Tn . Let i = ω4 = −1. Let Va = {vab : b ∈ Tr } be the
set of vectors
1
itr[(a+2b)x]
vab = √
2n

x∈Tn

(4)

a, b ∈ Tn . The standard basis E along with the sets Va , a ∈ Tn ,
n
form a complete set of 2n + 1 MUBs in C2 .
These are not the only known constructions of complete sets
of MUBs [11], but are good starting point for an investigation.

III. MUB S AS SUBMODULES AND SUBSPACES
A. Conjecture
Proposal 8: Let X be a complete set of MUBs which
contains the standard basis in Cd . Let N be the set containing
all the vectors from X, except the standard basis vectors. Let
x
the vectors in N be of the form αωq where α ∈ R, ωq is a q th
d
represent component wise
root of unity, and x ∈ Zq . Let
multiplication, let
v u
(9)
vˆu =
|v u|

B. Algebraic Structures
Let R be a ring with unity, a left R-module is an Abelian
group, M , together with a product R×M → M which satisﬁes
the following: for all ri , r2 ∈ R and ai , a2 ∈ M
1a =a,

(5)

(r1 r2 )a =r1 (r2 a)

(6)

(r1 + r2 )a =r1 a + r2 a

(7)

r(a1 + a2 ) =ra1 + ra2

(8)

x
and let N = {u ˆ v ∗ : u, v ∈ N }, M = {x : αωq ∈ N }, and
M = {x − y : x, y ∈ M }. Let U ⊂ M be the set containing
the vectors from M for which every entry is a non-unit, then
1) N is a Zq -module.
2) M \ U is the set of vectors representing a subspace of
a projective geometry over Zq .
We show this proposal is true for each of the constructions of
MUBs mentioned in section II-A. This proposal says nothing
about the existence of MUBs which are not constructed from
a ring. All projective geometries and projective Hjelmslev
geometries of dimension greater than 2 have an algebraic
structure [6, §1.4], [14]. It may be the same for complete sets
of MUBs.
MUBs for which the set of vectors forms a group under
point-wise multiplication have been studied [9]. Our construction is more general in that the algebraic structure is in the set
of vectors generated by point-wise multiplication.

This is familiar as the left axioms of a vector space. All Fmodules where F is a ﬁeld are vector spaces. Theorem 4 uses
a ring to construct MUBs, hence we need the more general
object of a module. We are only concerned with commutative
rings, thus all modules in consideration are both left and
right modules. An (left and right) R module is free if it is
isomorphic to Rd for some d.
The trace map, familiar from ﬁnite ﬁelds, may also be used
in Galois rings [24, §14]. Properties of trace map for GR(4, n)
have been well studied in a coding theory context [16].
Theorem 5: [24, Thms 7.12, 14.34, 14.37] The trace map,
tr : GR(ps , n) → GR(ps , 1) has the following properties:
1) For all r ∈ GR(ps , 1) and x ∈ GR(ps , n), rtr(x) =
tr(rx).
2) tr(α) = 0 if an only if there exists β ∈ R such that
α = β − φ(β).

B. Counting
Much of the evidence for connections between MUBs and
geometric structures stems from similarities in cardinality.
We show that Proposal 8 is plausible in general by using
cardinalities.
Lemma 9: Let q = pn , with p odd, each point in P G(q −
1, p) is represented by p − 1 vectors. The number of vectors

where φ is the generalized Frobenius automorphism. Note that
GR(p1 , n) ∼ Fpn .

[24].

represented by the points in a (2n − 1)-dimensional subspace
of P G(q − 1, q), with the addition of 0 is the same as the
number of vectors in a complete set of MUBs in Cq minus
the standard basis.
Proof: Let X be an m dimensional subspace of P G(pn −
m+1
−1
1, p) then there are p p−1 points, each of which may be
represented by p − 1 different vectors. Add the vector 0. (p −
m+1
−1
1) p p−1 + 1 = pm+1 . The number of vectors in a complete
set of MUBs in Cq , minus the standard basis is p2n . Thus
if we require every vector in the set of MUBs to represent a
point in the subspace, we need a 2n − 1 dimensional subspace
of P G(pn − 1, p).
Lemma 10: Each point in P HG(2n − 1, GR(4, 1)) is represented by 2 vectors. The number of vectors represented by
the points in a 2n−1 dimensional subspace of P HG(2n −
1, GR(4, 1)), with the addition of 2n vectors containing no
unit elements is the same as the number of vectors in a
n
complete set of MUBs in C2 without the standard basis.
Proof: Let X be an m dimensional subspace of
P HG(2n − 1, GR(4, 1)) then there are 2m points in each of
2m+1 − 1 neighbourhoods, each of which may be represented
by 2 different vectors. 2.2m (2m+1 − 1) = 22(m+1) − 2m+1 ,
which, when we add 2m vectors which are generated by non
units, is the number of vectors in a complete set of MUBs in
m+1
C2
, minus the standard basis.

2. Part 1. shows that M is a submodule, and thus forms a
n
subspace of Fp . The counting results of Lemma 10 show the
p
size of the subspace.
For all a, b, c, d ∈ Fq , any element in vef ∈ N can be
∗
constructed as vef = vab ˆ vcd for some vab , vcd ∈ N . Thus
in the deﬁnition of Proposal 8, N = N and M = M . Hence
Proposal 8 holds for planar function MUBs.

Theorem 12: Let X be the complete set of MUBs in Cp
generated by the Alltop construction (Thm 2). Let S ⊂ X be

p
x

T }, then
1) S , ˆ is an Fp -module.
2) T is a 2n − 1 dimensional subspace of P G(pn − 1, p).
Proof: Let vab , vcd be as deﬁned in equation (2). We now
show that S = N and T = M , with M, N from Theorem
11.

identity element, with vab ˆ v((−a)(−b) = v00 ensuring every
element has an inverse; commutativity comes from Fq . Thus
we have shown that N, ˆ is an Abelian group (See also [10,
Lem 2.84]). To show that it is a module Fp × N → N , let
r ∈ Fp , Let be an operation on the set N which corresponds
to scalar multiplication on the set M .

2. The proof is the same as for Theorem 11.
As with Theorem 11, we ﬁnd that M = M and N = N for
M, M , N, N as in Proposal 8.
These three structures based on ﬁnite ﬁelds all conform to
the structure of Proposal 8.

Theorem 11 may be used.
This highlights that structures which are not present in sets
of vectors, may be present in another way, see also [17]. We
use essentially the same proof for the MUBs generated by
Theorem 3.

IV. C ONCLUSION
We have shown that several sets of MUBs display the
algebraic structure of a module and the geometric structure of
a subspace of a projective Hjelmslev geometry. There are also
counting results to show that this geometric structure may be
true in general. Of particular note is that these structures may
not arise from the sets of vectors which deﬁne the MUBs,
but from the sets of vectors derived from component wise
multiplication.
We have not covered all possible constructions of MUBs,
but have shown sufﬁcient evidence that this is a structure
worthy of more thorough investigation.

vα ˆ vβ ∈ M . v0 is the identity, vα ˆ v−α = v0 showing
inverses, and commutativity is given by the properties of

and hence r vα ∈ M , for all r ∈ GR(4, 1). Hence M is a
submodule.
2. Part 1. shows that M is a module. To show M is free
we need that for every v such that 2v = 0, there exists u such
that 2u = v. Thus we require that if α is such that
2tr(αx) = tr(2αx) = 0

for all x ∈ Tn , then there exists β ∈ M such that α = 2β.
Reverting to the p-adic notation, let α = a+2b and β = c+2d,
then 2α = 0 + 2a and 2β = 0 + 2c. Hence we need to show
that if tr(2ax) = 0 for all x ∈ Tn , then a = 0.
Using Theorem 5.2, we see that this is equivalent to showing
that for all x ∈ Tn , there exists γ = (e+2f ) ∈ GR(4, n) such
that
2ax = e + 2f − φ(e + 2f )

(20)

2ax = e + 2f − e2 − 2f 2

(21)

where a, x, e, f ∈ Tn . This simpliﬁes to
ax = f − f 2

(25)

Hence if ax ∈ {ξ, ξ + 3} then equation (22) has no solution.
We require that equation (22) holds for ﬁxed a and all x ∈
Tn , hence we require that a = 0, which shows that M is a
free submodule. And thus by construction forms a subspace
of P HG(2n − 1, GR(4, 1)). The counting results of Lemma
10 show the size of the subspace.
Note that GR(ps , 1) ∼ Zps , and as with Theorem 11,
=
M = M and N = N , thus the conditions of Proposal 8
are satisﬁed.

If a = 0, then we have solved our problem. Assume a = 0,

This is a monic irreducible polynomial of degree 2, and hence
has possible solution only in GR(4, 2). Let h(f ) = f 2 −f +1,
