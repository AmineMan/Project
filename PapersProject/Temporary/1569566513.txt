may even outperform cooperative systems [2], [3].
In this paper, we investigate feedback optimizations for
different levels of cooperation, namely for network MIMO
and interference coordination schemes. We assume perfect
downlink CSI training so that all the users know their CSI
perfectly, and focus on studying how to split a total feedback
rate between the direct channel and interfering (cross) channel
as a function of different system parameters, including the
channel gains of these links. In this work, at the base stations,
the user data are precoded by a regularized zero-forcing (RZF)
type beamformer. In [4], such precoders were shown to be
optimal, in terms of minimizing the total downlink transmit
power while satisfying a speciﬁed target SINR, for different
levels of cooperation in a symmetric two-cell network where
the number of antennas and users in each cell is allowed to go
to inﬁnity with their ratio being ﬁxed. This is also the channel
model we will be considering in this work.
While channel state feedback in the single-cell system has
received a considerable amount of attention so far, fewer works
have addressed this problem in multi-cell settings: we will only
mention some works that are closely related to ours. For the
interference coordination scheme, [5] investigated the limited
feedback via RVQ in an inﬁnite Wyner cellular model using
generalized eigenvector beamforming at the base stations. The
authors derived an optimal bit partitioning strategy for direct
and interfering channels that minimizes the sum-rate gap. The
other work, also in the interference coordination setting, [6]
studies both CSI training and feedback optimization for the
analog and quantized feedback for what they call the intercell interference cancellation (ICIC) scheme.
Similar to [5] and [6], we perform feedback optimization
in an interference-coordination scheme, in our case, coordinated beamforming. We focus on digital feedback using
RVQ: the analog feedback case was treated in previous work
[7]. However, unlike those works, we do not assume intracell TDMA in each cell, and hence each user experiences
both intra-cell and inter-cell interference. We also consider
a different type of precoder, namely regularized zero-forcing
or channel inversion. Moreover, we also analyze the feedback
optimization for other levels of cooperations between the base
stations, albeit only for the two cell setup.
Our analysis relies on obtaining, for both network MIMO

Abstract—In a multicell network, the quality of the channel
state knowledge at the base stations (BSs) affects system performance. When this knowledge is acquired through a quantized
feedback scheme, its quality is roughly determined by the
number of feedback bits. In this paper we investigate feedback
optimization problems for the quantized feedback scheme via
random vector quantization (RVQ) in a two-cell MIMO broadcast channel. Assuming each user knows its direct and interfering
channel states perfectly, we address the following question: given
a total number of feedback bits, how should a user allocate
those bits to quantize its direct and cross channel information?
We pose that question for different levels of BS cooperation,
namely Network MIMO and Coordinated Beamforming (CBf).
We focus on regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding structures
and derive our results in the large system limit where the number
of users and antennas per BS tend to inﬁnity with their ratio
being ﬁxed. We show that for both cooperation schemes, each
user should allocate more bits to quantize the cross channel as
the latter’s gain ( ) increases. We also show that, contrary to the
full channel knowledge case, under this limited feedback scheme,
for some values of , no cooperation between the BSs is preferred.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The main challenge faced by multi-cell wireless networks
that adopt the next 4G standards to achieve peak data rates of
1 Gbit/s for low mobility and 100 Mbit/s for high mobility is
the inter-cell interference. In conventional networks, with no
cooperation between base stations (BSs), it is hard to achieve
those data rates. Allowing the BSs to cooperate, by sharing
control signals, channel state information (CSI) and user data
via backhaul links, will boost the spectral efﬁciency [1, and
references therein].
BS cooperation can be implemented at different levels [1].
In the Network MIMO scheme, also called multi-cell processing (MCP), the CSI and user data are exchanged amongst BSs.
This full cooperation requires high capacity backhaul links
which is sometimes not viable in practical settings. To alleviate
this requirement, only CSI is shared amongst base stations in
the interference coordination scheme [1]. More information
about these schemes and related issues are discussed in [1].
In addition to the backhaul costs, the advantages of cooperation are also accompanied by the overhead cost of the
CSI acquisition via channel training and feedback in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. Taking this overhead cost into
consideration, the conventional single-cell processing (SCP)

and CBf, SINR expressions in the large system limit: these
are used to derive optimal bit allocation for users to feed
back their direct and cross channel state information. For both
cooperation schemes, we show that, under a total feedback
rate constraint, the optimal bit allocation for the direct channel
decreases as the cross channel gain increases. This result
agrees with that in [5]. For the network MIMO, we also show
that the user will allocate all the bit rate available to quantize
the direct channel only when = 0. For the CBf, this happens
for values of less than a threshold th ≥ 0. Moreover, it
can be also shown that for some values of , the singlecell processing performs better than network MIMO and CBf,
unlike the case of perfect CSI at the BSs where cooperation
always outperforms SCP [4].

the direct and interfering channel, respectively. Moreover,
these codebooks are different for each user. In this work,
Bk,j,j is the same for all users and Bk,j,j = Bd , ∀k, j = 1, 2.
Similarly, Bk,j,¯ = Bc , ∀k, j = 1, 2. The total number of
j
feedback bits is denoted by Bt , where Bt = Bd + Bc .
Since optimal codebook design for the quantized feedback
may be difﬁcult, in this paper, for analytical tractability, we
consider the well-known RVQ scheme. The quantization vectors in the codebook are independently and randomly chosen
from the isotropic distribution on the N -dimensional unit
ˆ
sphere [8], [9]. Let uk,j,i be the vector in the corresponding
h
codebook which is closest to the channel direction hk,j,i and
k,j,i
2
let τk,j,i be the quantization distortion. From [8], for a given
τk,j,i , we can model hk,j,i as follows

II. S YSTEM M ODEL

hk,j,i =

We consider a symmetric two-cell broadcast channel where
each cell has K single antenna users and a base station
equipped with N antennas. The channel between user k in
cell j and the BS in cell i is denoted by row vector hk,j,i
where hk,j,j ∼ CN (0, IN ) and hk,j,¯ ∼ CN (0, IN ), for
j
j = 1, 2 and ¯ = mod (j, 2) + 1. We refer to the hk,j,j as
j
direct channels and hk,j,¯ as cross or “interfering” channels.
j
We ﬁnd it useful to group these into a single channel vector
hk,j = [hk,j,1 hk,j,2 ].
We consider an FDD system and assume that the users
have perfect knowledge of their downlink channels, hk,j,j
and hk,j,¯ . Each user feeds back the channel information to
j
the direct BS and neighboring BS through the corresponding
uplink channels. The BSs estimate or recover these channel
states and use them to construct the precoder.
The received signal of user k in cell j can be written as

2
ˆ
1 − τk,j,i hk,j,i uk,j,i + τk,j,i hk,j,i zk,j,i , (1)

where zk,j,i is isotropically distributed in the null-space of
ˆ
uk,j,i and it is independent of τk,j,i .
ˆ
Each user then sends the index of uk,j,i and also the channel
magnitude hk,j,i (see also [10]). By assuming that the BSs
can receive the information perfectly, the channel estimate at
the BS can be written as
(2)

ˆ
hk,j,i = hk,j,i uk,j,i .
Moreover, we can rewrite the vector zk,j,i as
zk,j,i =

vk,j,i Π⊥

and vk,j,i ∼ CN (0, I) is

independent of hk,j,i . Thus, (1) becomes

yk,j = hk,j,1 x1 + hk,j,2 x2 + nk,j
where xi ∈ CN , i = 1, 2 is the transmitted data from
2
BS i, and nk,j ∼ CN (0, σd ) is the noise at the user’s
receiver. The transmitted data xi depends on the level of
cooperation assumed, and will be described in more details
in Sections II-B and II-C: we restrict ourselves to linear
precoding schemes, more speciﬁcally regularized zero-forcing
approaches. We assume each BS’s transmission is subject to
a power constraint E xi 2 = Pi . In the network MIMO
case, we relax this constraint to a sum power constraint so
2
that E x 2 = i=1 Pi = Pt . In the analysis, we assume

P1 = P2 = P and denote γd = P/σd .

where hk,j,i = τk,j,i hk,j,i zk,j,i .
Note that hk,j,i has the same statistical distribution as hk,j,i
i.e., hk,j,i ∼ CN (0, ji I), where ji = 1 when i = j and
otherwise, ji = .
The channel estimates are used by the BSs to construct the precoder. In what follows, let us denote
hk,j = [hk,j,1 hk,j,2 ], hk,j = [hk,j,1 hk,j,2 ] and H =
[ h H h H · · · h H h H h H · · · h H ]H .

B. Network MIMO
In the network MIMO setting, both BSs share the channel
information and data symbols for all users in the network.
Therefore, we may consider the network as a broadcast channel with 2N transmit antennas and 2K single antenna users.
The BSs construct the precoding matrix using their channel
estimates. In this work, we consider regularized channel inversion precoding, for which the precoding or beamforming
vector for user k in cell j, wkj , can be written as

A. Channel Model: Quantized Feedback via RVQ
As already mentioned, in practical scenarios, perfect CSI is
difﬁcult to obtain and the CSI at the BSs is obtained through
feedback from the users. In this paper, we are interested
in ‘digital CSI feedback’, where each user sends quantized
versions of the direct and interfering channel information to
the BS. Thus, user k in cell j uses Bk,j,j and Bk,j,¯ bits
j
to quantize or feed back the direct and interfering channel,
respectively. The total number of feedback bits is assumed to
be ﬁxed. Also, each user has different codebooks to quantize

Theorem 1 shows that the limiting SINR is the same for all
users in both cells. This is not surprising given the symmetry
in their channel statistics and feedback mechanisms. Moreover,
the only dependence of the limiting SINR on the bit allocation
is via γe , which itself is a function of d: d can be interpreted
as a measure of the total quality of the channel estimates; In

fact, given that Bd and Bc are constrained to sum up to Bt , d
in (8) highlights a trade-off between increasing feedback bits
for direct channel and cross channel.
It is easy to check that the limiting SINR is an increasing
function of d. Thus, obtaining an optimal bit allocation that
maximizes the limiting SINR is equivalent to maximizing d,
i.e. solving (cf. Eq. (8)).

which is an extension of regularized zero-forcing to the
coordinated beamforming setup [4]. The constant cj is chosen
to satisfy per-BS power constraint E[ xj 2 ] = Pj , j = 1, 2.
Note that designing the precoding matrix at BS j requires
local CSI only (the hk,i,j from BS j to all users, but not the
channels from the other BS to the users). The SINR of user
k in cell j is given by

III. L ARGE S YSTEM R ESULTS
In this section, we derive approximations of the SINR for
network MIMO (4) and CBf (5) by analyzing them in the large
system limit where N → ∞, K/N → β, β > 0 being some
ﬁnite constant. We refer to these approximations as the limiting
SINRs and use them to optimize the feedback bit allocation,
and regularization parameter. This joint optimization problem
can be split into two steps. First, we derive the optimal

Plugging the optimal bit allocation back into the limiting SINR
expression, we can then proceed to the second step where
we obtain the optimal regularization parameter. At the end

to the space limitation, all the proofs for the theorems and

As in Theorem 1, Theorem 5 shows that that the limiting

of estimating the direct channel, δd , affects both the signal

the quality of the cross channel and determines the strength

of the inter-cell interference. Since Bt is ﬁxed, increasing Bd ,

The stationary point, Xd , is obtained by evaluating the

veriﬁed that the sign of Z is the same as the sign of the
derivative of the limiting SINR over xd . Thus, Xd will be the
unique positive solution of the quadratic equation Z = 0.
∂Z
It can be also checked that ∂xd < 0 and thus, Z is
decreasing in xd . Since at xd = 1, Z < 0, we should never
allocate x∗ = 1. We will allocate xd = Xt if Z ≤ 0 at
d
xd = Xt (this condition is satisﬁed whenever ≤ th ).
Unlike the network MIMO case where x∗ = Xt only when
d
= 0, in the CBf, it is optimal for a user to allocate all Bt
to the direct channel when 0 ≤ ≤ th . Note that x∗ = Xt
d
does not imply that the cooperation breaks down or that both
BSs perform single-cell processing. It is easy to check that th

increases when Bt or γd is decreased. This suggests that when
the resource for the feedback bits is scarce or the received
SNR is low then it is preferable for the user to allocate all
the feedback bits to quantize the direct channel. So, in this
situation, quantizing the cross channel does more harm to the
performance the system. However, as increases beyond th ,
quantizing the cross channel will improve the SINR. We can
show that x∗ , particularly Xd , is increasing in .

Once we have the optimal bit allocation, we can ﬁnd the
optimal ρC , as we did for network MIMO. While tractable,
this problem is more complicated, and is skipped due to space
limitations. Interested readers may refer to [11].

V. C ONCLUSION

In the following, we present numerical simulations that
show the behavior of the limiting SINR and optimal bit
allocation for network MIMO and CBf as varies. We set
¯
the SNR at 10 dB, Bt = 4 and β = 0.6. The optimal bit
allocation is illustrated in Figure 1. As shown in Section III,
¯
the optimal Bd for network MIMO is decreasing in and
¯ ∗ = Bt when = 0. For CBf, B ∗ = Bt when ≤ 0.19, and
¯
¯
¯
Bd
d
¯∗
after that decreases as grows. Overall, for given , Bd for
CBf is larger than for network MIMO, implying the quality
of the direct channel information is more important for CBf.
In Figure 2, the optimal values for the regularization parameter and bit allocation are used to compute the limiting SINR.
From that ﬁgure, it is obvious that SINR∞ decreases as
CBf
increases. In the case of network MIMO, as predicted by the
analysis, the lower bound of the limiting SINR is decreasing
until ∗
M,RVQ ≈ 0.72 and increasing after that point. By comparing the limiting SINR for both cooperation schemes, it is also
interesting to see that for some values of , i.e., in the interval
¯∗
when CBf has Bc = 0, the CBf slightly outperforms network
MIMO. We should note that within the current scheme, when
¯∗
Bc = 0, CBf and network MIMO are not the same as singlecell processing (SCP): under RVQ, there is still a quantization
vector in the codebook that is used to represent the cross
channel (although it is uncorrelated with the actual channel
vector being quantized).
Motivated by the above facts, we investigate whether SCP
provides some advantages over network MIMO and CBf for
¯
some (low) values of . In SCP, we use Bk,j,j = Bt = 4
bits (∀k, j) to quantize the direct channel. The cross channels
in the precoder are represented by vectors with zero entries.
From Figure 2, it is obvious that the SCP outperforms network
MIMO and CBf for some values of . For up to ≈ 0.13, SCP
outperforms both network MIMO and CBf. Surprisingly, the
CBf is still beaten by SCP until ≈ 0.82. This means that the
SCP still gives advantages over the CBf even in a quite strong
interference regime with this level of feedback.

In this paper, we have performed the bit allocation optimization for quantized feedback with RVQ in two-cell network MIMO and coordinated beamforming schemes. For both
cooperation schemes, we showed that as increases, the bit
allocation for the cross channel is non-decreasing. In the
network MIMO case, each user allocates all bits to quantize
the direct channel only when = 0 while in the CBf it happens
when is below a certain threshold. We also showed that for
some values of , SCP outperforms both cooperation schemes.
