shown to satisfy a local cooperation constraint and employ a
simple zero forcing transmit beamforming strategy. Here, we
extend the result on the optimality of local cooperation for a
general setting of the parameters N , M , and L. Moreover, we
generalize the scheme in [2] for values of N, L > 1, and show
that the proposed scheme is optimal among the class of all
coding schemes relying on zero forcing transmit beamforming.
We further use those results to compare the following two
cases: (i) the case where each transmitter has multiple antennas
but no cooperation is allowed (M = 1, N > 1), and (ii)
the case where each transmitter has a single antenna and
cooperation is allowed (N = 1, M > 1). Finally, we derive
a general upper bound on the per user DoF number that
reduces to the one in presented in [2] for the special case
of N = L = 1.

Abstract—We consider locally connected K−user MISO interference channels where each transmitter has N antennas and is
connected to the receiver with the same index as well as L
2
successively preceding receivers and L following receivers. We
2
assume that each receiver is interested in one message, which
can be available at a maximum of M transmitters. Under these
assumptions, we study the available degrees of freedom as well
as the optimal way to assign messages to transmitters. For the
case where each message is assigned to the transmitter with
KN
the same index, we know from [1] that N +1 DoF is achievable
for the considered locally connected channel using interference
alignment as the number of symbol extensions goes to inﬁnity.
In this work, we show that a simple linear strategy employing
2M N
zero forcing transmit beams achieves min M (N +1)+L , 1 per
user degrees of freedom. In particular, the NN per user DoF is
+1
achievable by coding over only one channel realization, for any
L
value of M ≥ N +1 . Moreover, we show that the proposed scheme
is optimal among a class of linear strategies where each receiver
is either inactive or enjoys interference-free communication.
Finally, we generalize the upper bound proved for Wyner’s
asymmetric channel model (L = 1) in [2], and show that message
assignments satisfying a local cooperation constraint are optimal
for a general setting of the parameters.

We use the standard model for the K−user interference
channel with N -antenna transmitters and single antenna receivers.

Enhancing the infrastructure is one of the classical approaches to increase the rate of communication in cellular
networks. In this work, we assess the performance of two ways
to enhance the infrastructure of wireless networks, and study
their role in managing interference. The ﬁrst enhancement is
to deploy multiple antennas at each transmitter, and the second
is to use a backhaul link to allow each message to be available
at multiple transmitters, i.e., Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP)
transmission [3]. To this end, we study a K−user MISO
interference channel where each message can be available
at a maximum of M transmitters, each of which has N
antennas. Also, to capture the effect of distance based path
losses in wireless channels, we assume that each transmitter is
connected to only the receiver carrying its own index as well
as L neighboring receivers that are located in a symmetric
fashion around it.
Following recent results in [4] and [5], the per user degrees
of freedom number was characterized in [2] for a special
case of the considered channel model obtained by setting
N = L = 1. In particular, the optimal coding scheme was

Hij (t)Xj (t) + Zi (t)

Yi (t) =

(1)

j=1 n=1
(n)

where t is the time index, Xi (t) is the transmitted signal of
the nth antenna at transmitter i, Yi (t) is the received signal
of receiver i, Zi (t) is the zero mean unit variance Gaussian
(n)
noise at receiver i, and Hij (t) is the channel coefﬁcient from
the nth antenna at transmitter j to receiver i over the tth time
slot. We remove the time index in the rest of the paper for
brevity.
We use [K] to denote the set {1, 2, . . . , K}. For any set A ⊆
¯
[K], we deﬁne the complement set A = {i : i ∈ [K], i ∈ A}.
/
For each i ∈ [K], let Wi be the message intended for receiver
i, we use the abbreviations WA , XA , YA , and ZA to denote
(n)
the sets {Wi , i ∈ A}, {Xi , n ∈ [N ], i ∈ A}, {Yi , i ∈ A},
and {Zi , i ∈ A}, respectively.
A. Channel Model
In order to capture the local connectivity of the channel, we
assume a channel model that is a function of the number of
interferers L. In particular, ∀n ∈ [N ],

1

of each message at multiple antennas allows a design for
the corresponding transmit vectors to null the interference
caused by the message at selected receivers. More precisely,
the transmit signal at the nth antenna of the j th transmitter is
given by,
(n)
(n)
Xj =
Xj,i

L
L
≤ j ≤ i+

(2)
and all channel coefﬁcients that are not identically zero are
drawn independently from a continuous distribution. We note
that for values of L = 1 and L = 2, the channel reduces the
commonly known Wyner’s asymmetric and symmetric linear
models, respectively.
(n)

Hij is not identically 0 if and only if i−

i:j∈Ti
(n)

where Xj,i depends only on message Wi . In [2], a coding
scheme in the above form was employed to provide an
asymptotic characterization of the per user degrees of freedom
for Wyner’s linear asymmetric model with single antenna
transmitters. i.e., the case where N = 1 and L = 1, and it was
2M
shown that τ (N = 1, M, L = 1) = 2M +1 . In the following,
we generalize the coding scheme in [2] to provide a lower
bound on the per user DoF for arbitrary values of the system
parameters.

τ (N, M, L) ≥ min
M (N + 1) + L

B. Cooperation Model
For each i ∈ [K], let Wi be the message intended for
receiver i, and Ti ⊆ [K] be the transmit set of receiver i, i.e.,
those transmitters with the knowledge of Wi . The transmitters
in Ti cooperatively transmit the message Wi to the receiver i.
The messages {Wi } are assumed to be independent of each
other. The cooperation order M is deﬁned as the maximum
size of a transmit set:
M = max |Ti |.

C. Degrees of Freedom

Proof: We ﬁrst consider the case where M N < L+M by
treating the network as clusters, each consisting of consecutive
M (N + 1) + L transceivers. The last L transmitters in each
cluster are deactivated to eliminate inter-cluster interference,
and hence, it sufﬁces to show that 2M N DoF can be achieved
in each cluster. Without loss of generality, consider the cluster
with users of indices in the set [M (N + 1) + L]. Deﬁne the
following subsets of [M (N + 1) + L],

The total power constraint across all the users is P . Let Wi
denote the alphabet for message Wi , then the rates Ri (P ) =
log |Wi |
are achievable if the decoding error probabilities of
n
all messages can be simultaneously made arbitrarily small
for large enough n. The capacity region C(P ) is the set of
all achievable rate tuples. The total number of degrees of
freedom (η) is deﬁned as lim supP →∞ CΣ (P ) , where CΣ (P )
log P
is the sum capacity. Since η depends on the speciﬁc choice of
transmit sets, as well as the speciﬁc realization of the channel
coefﬁcients, we deﬁne η(K, N, M, L) as the best achievable
η over all choices of transmit sets satisfying the cooperation
order constraint in (3), and holds for almost all realizations
of a K−user locally connected channel deﬁned as above
with N −antenna transmitters, and the channel coefﬁcients
satisfy (2). In order to simplify our analysis, we deﬁne the per
user DoF number τ (N, M, L) to measure how η(K, N, M, L)
scales with K while all other parameters remain ﬁxed.

[M N ],

S2

=

{L + M + 1, L + M + 2, . . . , L + M (N + 1)}.

In the proposed scheme, messages with indices in the set
[M (N + 1) + L]\(S1 ∪ S2 ) are not transmitted and the corresponding receivers are deactivated. The remaining messages
are assigned as follows,
{1, 2, . . . , M },
∀i ∈ S1
Ti =
{M N + 1, M N + 2, . . . , M (N + 1)},
∀i ∈ S2
and all other transmitters in the cluster are deactivated. In other
words, the ﬁrst M N messages in the cluster are assigned to
transmitters in the set [M ], and the last M N messages in the
cluster are assigned to the M transmitters with indices in the
set {M N + 1, M N + 2, . . . , M (N + 1)}.
Now, we note that messages with indices in S1 are not
available outside transmitters with indices in [M ], and hence,
do not cause interference at receivers with indices in S2 . Also,
messages with indices in S2 are not available at transmitters
with indices in [M N ], and hence, do not cause interference at
receivers with indices in S1 .
In order to complete the proof by showing that each user
in S1 ∪ S2 achieves one degree of freedom, we next show
that transmissions corresponding to messages with indices in
S1 (S2 ) do not cause interference at receivers with indices in
the same set. Let S1,j denote the set {(j −1)N +1, (j −1)N +
2, . . . , jN } where j ∈ [M ], and consider the design of transmit beams for messages Wi , i ∈ S1,j . Our aim is to create an

For the above described channel model where L > 1, let
x = L . We silence the ﬁrst x transmitters, and deactivate the
2
last x receivers, relabel the transmit signals to obtain a (K−x)user channel where the ith transmitter is connected to receivers
in the set {Yk : k ∈ {i, i + 1, . . . , i + L}}. We note that the
new channel model gives the same value of τ (N, M, L) as the
original one, as x = o(K). Unless explicitly stated otherwise,
we will be using this equivalent model in the rest of the paper.

In this section, we consider a simple linear precoding
coding scheme, where each message is assigned to a set
of transmitters with successive indices, and a zero-forcing
transmit beamforming strategy is employed. The availability

˜j ) for all j ∈ [K]. Note that
is either 0 or equals h(Y
˜
h(Yj |Wj ) = 0 for the case where user j enjoys interference˜
˜
free communication and h(Yj |Wj ) = h(Yj ) for the other
case where Wj is not transmitted. Let τZF (N, M, L) denote
the asymptotic characterization of the per user DoF number
under the restriction to the above described class of coding
schemes. In Theorem 2 below, we show that the coding
scheme in the proof of Theorem 1 achieves the optimal value
of τZF (N, M, L). We ﬁrst prove the following lemma that
bounds the number of receivers at which the interference of
a given message can be canceled. For a set S ⊆ [K], let
VS be the set of indices for active receivers connected to
transmitters with indices in S. More precisely, VS = {j :
˜
h(Yj |Wj ) = 0, S ∩ {j, j − 1, . . . , j − L} = φ}, where φ
is the empty set. To obtain the following results, we assume
that for each transmitter in Ti , message Wi contributes to
the transmit signal of at least one antenna at this transmitter.
(n)
i.e., ∀j ∈ Ti , ∃n ∈ [N ] : I(Wi , Xj,i ) > 0. Note that this
assumption does not introduce a loss in generality as otherwise
the transmitter can be removed from Ti . We need the following
lemma for the proof of the upper bound on τZF (N, M, L) in
Theorem 2.
Lemma 1:
|VTi | ≤ N |Ti |
(7)

interference-free communication between the (i − (j − 1)N )th
antenna at the j th transmitter to the ith receiver. We prove this
by showing the existence of an assignment for the transmit
(n)
signals {Xk,i : n ∈ [N ], k ∈ [M ], (k, n) = (j, i − (j − 1)N )}
to cancel the interference caused by Wi at the M N − 1
receivers in S1 \{i}. Consider the design of the transmit beam
(n)
at the nth antenna of the k th transmitter Xk,i , where n ∈
[N ], k ∈ [M ], (k, n) = (j, i−(j−1)N ), and note that given all
(n)
other transmit signals carrying Wi , Xk,i can be designed such
th
that the interference caused by Wi at the ((k − 1)N + n)
receiver is canceled. Therefore, the interference cancellation
constraints pose a system of M N − 1 equations in M N − 1
variables, where each equation is assigned a distinct variable,
that can be set to satisfy it, given any assignment of the other
M N − 2 variables. Moreover, the considered equations are
linearly independent almost surely, as we assume that channel
coefﬁcients are drawn independently from a continuous distribution. It is easy to see that there exists an assignment of
the variables to satisfy the equations for almost all channel
realizations.
We ﬁnally note that the channel between transmitters with
indices in the sequence (M (N +1), M (N +1)−1, . . . , M N +
1) and receivers with indices in the sequence (L + M (N +
1), L+M (N +1)−1, . . . , L+M +1) has the same connectivity
pattern to the channel between transmitters with indices in
the sequence (1, 2, . . . , M ) and receivers with indices in the
sequence (1, 2, . . . , M N ), and hence the argument in the
previous paragraph can be used to construct transmit beams
for messages Wi , i ∈ S2 such that each user in S2 gets access
to an interference-free transmission (one degree of freedom).
The proof is simpler for the case where N M ≥ L + M . Let
xmin = minx {x ∈ N : N x ≥ L + x}, then xmin ≤ M , and
the messages are assigned as Ti = {i, i + 1, . . . , i + xmin − 1}.
Consider the design of transmit beams for message Wi . Our
aim is to allow for interference-free communication between
the ﬁrst antenna at the ith transmitter and the ith receiver, and
eliminate the interference caused by Wi at all receivers in the
set {i + 1, . . . , i + Lxmin − 1}. We omit the rest of the proof
for brevity as the design of transmit beams is similar to the
above described proof of the ﬁrst case.
We note that in the above coding scheme, some messages
are not being transmitted in order to allow for interferencefree communication for the remaining messages. It is worth
noting that this can be done while maintaining fairness in the
allocation of the available DoF over all users in a system where
multiple sessions of communication take place by deactivating
different sets of receivers in different sessions. e.g., in different
time slots or different sub-carriers in an OFDM system.
In Section V, we show that the lower bound stated in (6) is
tight in special cases. Here, in order to assess the optimality of
the above result for arbitrary values of the system parameters,
we consider a class of coding schemes that only employs
a Zero Forcing Transmit Beam-Forming strategy. i.e., the
transmit signals are of the form (5) and each message is
either not transmitted or it is allocated one degree of freedom.

Proof: The proof is available in the journal version of
this work [6], and we omit it here for brevity. The key idea
is that since the probability of a zero measure set of channel
realizations is zero, the N |Ti | transmit signals carrying Wi
cannot be designed jointly to cancel Wi at more than N |Ti |−1
receivers for almost all channel realizations.
Theorem 2:
τZF (N, M, L) = min

2M N
,1
M (N + 1) + L

(8)

Proof: The proof of the lower bound is the same
as the proof of Theorem 1. It then sufﬁces to show that
2M N
τZF (N, M, L) ≤ M (N +1)+L for the case where N M <
L + M . In order to prove the upper bound, we show that the
sum degree of freedom in each set S ⊆ [K] of consecutive
M (N + 1) + L users is bounded by 2M N . Assume otherwise,
then there is an active user in S that lies in the middle of
a subset of 2M N + 1 active users in S. More precisely,
˜
∃i ∈ S : |Ti | > 0, |{j : j < i, j ∈ S, h(Yj |Wj ) = 0}| ≥
˜
M N, |{j : j > i, j ∈ S, h(Yj |Wj ) = 0}| ≥ M N . Let
smin = mins {s : s ∈ S} and smax = maxs {s : s ∈ S},
then if ∃s ∈ Ti : s ∈ {smin , smin − 1, . . . , smin − L}, it
˜
follows that VTi ⊇ {j : j < i, j ∈ S, h(Yj |Wj ) = 0} ∪ {i},
hence |VTi | ≥ M N + 1, which contradicts (7). Also, if
∃s ∈ Ti : s ∈ {smax , smax − 1, . . . , smax − L}, then
˜
VTi ⊇ {j : j > i, j ∈ S, h(Yj |Wj ) = 0} ∪ {i}, hence
|VTi | ≥ M N + 1, which again contradicts (7). Finally, for
the remaining case, by applying Lemma 2, we know that Ti
does not contain a transmitter with an index that is less than

3

smin or greater than smax , hence, at least L + |Ti | receivers in
S are connected to one or more transmitters in Ti , and since
S has at least 2M N + 1 active receivers, then any subset of
L + |Ti | receivers in S has to have at least 2M N + 1 − ((L +
M (N + 1)) − (L + |Ti |)) = M N + |Ti | − (M − 1) active
receivers, hence,
|VTi |

≥ M N + |Ti | − (M − 1)

with the restriction to zero-forcing transmit beamforming coding schemes. While we observe that Lemma 2 does not imply
that transmit sets have to consist of successive transmitter
indices, it is intuitive to think that such a condition is necessary
as it minimizes the number of receivers at which each message
causes undesired interference.

In order to prove an upper bound on the per user DoF, we
perform two initial steps. First, we simplify the combinatorial
aspect of the problem by restricting our search for message
assignments satisfying the cooperation order constraint to only
a special class of such assignments. Second, we prove a
condition of equivalence, in terms of the considered criterion,
between the considered channel model and another model
that is obtained by removing some of the receivers, thereby
bounding the DoF of the channel by the number of receivers
in the equivalent model.
The ﬁrst step is dealt with in Section IV. While we noted
that Lemma 2 does not necessarily imply the condition stated
in (12), we will be restricted in this section to message
assignments satisfying (12), as it will allow us to derive
an upper bound for arbitrary system parameters. For the
second step, we use a general lemma for upper bounding the
available degrees of freedom for reliable communication over
a multiuser channel.
For any set A ⊆ [K], Deﬁne UA = ∪i∈A Ti . Assume that η
/
degrees of freedom are available for the considered channel.
Lemma 3 ([2], Lemma 2): If there exists a set A ⊆ [K]
and a function f , such that f YA , ZA , XUA = XUA , then
¯
η ≤ |A|.
Let τ (N, M, L) be the maximum achievable per user DoF
˜
for the considered channel model τ (N, M, L), where only
message assignments satisfying (12) are considered.
Theorem 3: If N M ≥ L + M , then τ (N, M, L) = 1,
˜
otherwise,

and the statement is proved by reaching a contradiction to (7)
in the last case.
IV. U SEFUL M ESSAGE A SSIGNMENTS
In order to characterize an upper bound on the per user
DoF τ (N, M, L), we have to consider all possible message
assignments satisfying the cooperation order constraint (3). In
this section, we use results from [2] to characterize necessary
conditions for the optimal message assignment.
For message Wi , and a ﬁxed transmit set Ti , we construct
the following graph GWi ,Ti that has [K] as its set of vertices,
and an edge exists between any given pair of vertices x, y ∈
[K] if and only if,
• x, y ∈ Ti .
• Corresponding transmitters are both connected to at least
one receiver. In the channel model deﬁned in (2), this
condition reduces to |x − y| ≤ L.
Vertices corresponding to transmitters connected to Yi are
given a special mark, i.e., vertices with labels in the set {i, i −
1, . . . , i − L} are marked for the considered channel model.
Lemma 2 ([2], Lemma 1): For any k ∈ Ti such that the
vertex k in GWi ,Ti belongs to a component that does not
contain a marked vertex, removing k from Ti does not decrease
the sum rate.
We call a message assignment useful if no element in it can
be removed without decreasing the sum rate. The following
corollary to the above lemma characterizes a necessary condition for any message assignment satisfying the cooperation
order constraint in (3) to be useful.
Corollary 1: Let Ti be a useful message assignment and
|Ti | ≤ M , then ∀k ∈ [K], k ∈ Ti only if the vertex k in
GWi ,Ti lies at a distance that is less than or equal M − 1 from
a marked vertex.
Note that in the considered channel model, the above result
implies that Ti ⊆ {i − M L, i − M L + 1, . . . , i + (M − 1)L}.
In the coding scheme illustrated in Section III, we use a
message assignment that satisﬁes the condition in Corollary 1.
Furthermore, each transmit set consists of a successive set of
transmitter indices. More precisely,

M (N + 1) + L − 1
2M N
≤ τ (N, M, L) ≤
˜
(13)
L + M (N + 1)
M (N + 1) + L

(12)

Proof: The lower bounds follow from Theorem 1. We
only need to show the upper bound for the case where N M <
L+M . By carefully inspecting the lower and upper bounds, we
note that they coincide for the case where N M = L + M − 1.
This guides our choice in that special case for the set A when
applying Lemma 3 to the set of active receivers in the proof
of Theorem 1. i.e., we view the network as clusters, each
consisting of successive M (N + 1) + L = 2M N + 1 users,
and we remove the middle receiver from each cluster. We then
generalize this choice for general values of N, M, and L such
that N M < L + M by viewing the network as clusters, each
consisting of M (N + 1) + L successive users, and we remove
the (L + M )th receiver from each cluster. It then sufﬁces to
show that the condition in Lemma 3 holds for this choice of
the set A. More precisely, Let the set A be deﬁned as follows.

and hence, assigning each message to a successive set of transmitters is a property of the optimal assignment of messages

A = {i, i ∈ [K], i = (M (N +1)+L)(j−1)+L+M, ∀j ∈ Z+ }.
(14)

Ti = {s, s + 1, . . . , s + x − 1},
s ∈ {i − L − (x − 1), i − L − (x − 1) + 1, . . . , i},
x ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M },

4

x
x+1 ,

We then need to show that there exists a function f , such that
f YA , ZA , XUA = XUA .
¯
To prove the existence of the function f described above,
we ﬁrst note that by using the condition in (12), we know that
for any message with an index that lies at the intersection of
¯
the set A and a given cluster, all members of its transmit set
have indices that belong to the same cluster, and consequently,
for any positive integer j, T(M (N +1)+L)(j−1)+L+M = UA ∩
{(M (N +1)+L)(j −1)+1, . . . , (M (N +1)+L)j}. Now, we
know that the number of unknown transmit signals in XUA in
the ﬁrst cluster is less than or equal to M N , and by removing
the effect of the signals XUA and ZA from YA , we obtain at
¯
least M N linear equations in XUA ∩[M (N +1)+L] . We ﬁnally
show in [6] that those linear equations contain a subset of
M N independent linear equations and thereby the missing
signals can be recovered. The proof for the remaining clusters
follows in a similar fashion.
As we note that Lemma 2 implies the condition in (12)
for the special where M = 1 and where L = 1, i.e.,
τ (N, M, L) = τ (N, M, L) if min(M, L) = 1. We have the
˜
following corollaries to Theorem 3.
Corollary 2: For the case where each message can be made
available at only one transmitter (M = 1), then τ (N, M =
1, L) = 1 if N ≥ L + 1, and otherwise,

while for the case where each transmitter has a single
antenna, and M = x = 2, the per user DoF number is shown
1
to be 2 in [7].
B. Optimality of Local Cooperation
Although we do not provide a tight characterization for
τ (N, M, L), we know from Corollary 1 that the optimal
message assignment satisﬁes a local cooperation constraint,
that is, each transmit set is restricted within a radius that does
not scale linearly with K. More precisely, for all values of K,
Ti ⊆ {i − r(K), i − r(K) + 1, . . . , i + r(K)}, ∀i ∈ [K] (17)
where r(K) = o(K).
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we considered a class of MISO interference
channels with symmetric local connectivity under a cooperation constraint that bounds the number of transmitters at
which any message can be available by a cooperation order
M . We then characterized the per user DoF number for zero
forcing transmit beamforming strategies that do not require
the use of symbol extensions. In particular, it was shown
that using a ﬁxed cooperation orders that does not scale with
the number of users, the proposed scheme achieves more
1
than the 2 per user DoF number that is obtained without
cooperation (see [8]). Moreover, the per user DoF number
approaches unity as the cooperation order increases. We then
proved an upper bound on the per user DoF number that is
tight for special settings of the system parameters. The per
user DoF number characterized in [2] for Wyner’s asymmetric
model follows as a special case of the shown lower and upper
bounds. Finally, the tradeoff between adding an extra antenna
at each transmitter and incrementing the cooperation order, is
discussed in light of the derived results.

Consider a comparison between two different scenarios.
In the ﬁrst, each message can be transmitted from a single
transmitter that has x antennas, i.e., N = x, M = 1, while in
the second scenario, each message can be transmitted from
x single antenna transmitters, i.e., N = 1, M = x. We
note that the number of receivers at which a given message causes undesired interference is L in the ﬁrst scenario,
and is at least L + x − 1 in the second. For this reason,
τZF (N = x, M = 1, L) > τZF (N = 1, M = x, L), ∀x > 1.
It is worth noting that the number of receivers at which
each message causes undesired interference is not the only
difference between the considered scenarios. In particular,
other differences between the two scenarios affect the available
DoF when considering general coding schemes beyond the
simple zero forcing transmit beamforming scheme considered
in Section III. In the fully connected model where all channel
coefﬁcients are drawn independently from a continuous distribution, the number of receivers at which a given message
causes undesired interference is the same for both considered
scenarios. However, the per user DoF number for the ﬁrst
scenario where x antennas are dedicated to each message is
