remarkably high correlation (r = 0.95) between the speed
of discrimination in humans and the L1 distance between the
ﬁring rate vectors of the two images. They concluded that
the more similar the neuronal representation (in monkey IT
cortex), the tougher it is for humans to distinguish the images.
In this paper, we model the visual search problem as an
active sequential multiple hypothesis testing problem (ASHT
problem), ﬁrst studied by Chernoff [2]. In sequential hypothesis testing [3]–[9], the only decision a controller makes at
each stage is to either stop and make a decision or continue
to draw another sample and trade off the cost of delay for
a decision of better quality. In active sequential hypothesis
testing, the controller is additionally capable of controlling
the quality of the sample drawn. In our experiment the human
subject can actively choose the location to sample based on
past observations and actions.

Abstract—We consider a visual search problem studied by
Sripati and Olson where the objective is to identify an oddball
image embedded among multiple distractor images as quickly as
possible. We model this visual search task as an active sequential
hypothesis testing problem (ASHT problem). Chernoff in 1959
proposed a policy in which the expected delay to decision is
asymptotically optimal. The asymptotics is under vanishing error
probabilities. We ﬁrst prove a stronger property on the moments
of the delay until a decision, under the same asymptotics.
Applying the result to the visual search problem, we then propose
a “neuronal metric” on the measured neuronal responses that
captures the discriminability between images. From empirical
study we obtain a remarkable correlation (r = 0.90) between the
proposed neuronal metric and speed of discrimination between
the images. Although this correlation is lower than with the L1
metric used by Sripati and Olson, this metric has the advantage
of being ﬁrmly grounded in formal decision theory.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Sripati and Olson [1] studied the correlation between the
speed of discrimination of images and a measure of dissimilarity of neuronal representations of the images in the
inferotemporal (IT) cortex of the brain. They conducted two
sets of experiments, one on human subjects and the other on
macaque monkeys. The experiments were the following.
(1) In the experiment on humans, subjects were shown a
picture as in Figure 1(a) having six images placed at the
vertices of a regular hexagon, with one image being different
from the others. In particular, let I1 and I2 be two images.
One of these two was picked randomly with equal probability
and was placed at one of the six locations randomly, again
with equal probability. The remaining ﬁve locations contained
the copies of the other image. See Figure 1(a) and 1(b). The
subjects were required to identify the correct half (left or right)
of the plane where the odd image was located. The subjects
were advised to indicate their decision ”as quickly as possible
without guessing” [1]. The time taken to make a decision after
the onset of the image was recorded.
(2) In the other set of experiments on macaque monkeys,
the images I1 and I2 were displayed on the screen, and the
neuronal ﬁrings elicited by I1 separately and I2 separately on
a set of IT neurons were recorded. The neuronal representation
of an image was taken to be a vector of average ﬁring
rates across the neurons. The two experiments were done
on several pairs (I1 ,I2 ) of images. The authors observed a

Two examples of search task conﬁgurations.

a) Prior Work: Chernoff [2] formulated the ASHT problem, proved an asymptotic lower bound under vanishing error
probabilities and further devised the so-called Procedure A
that he went on to show was asymptotically optimal under
vanishing error probabilities. Recently Naghshvar and Javidi
[10]–[12], also motivated by a visual search problem, cast
Chernoff’s problem into the framework of dynamic programming and attempted to derive structural properties on the value
functions and the decision regions. A related but different line
of research was carried out by Rao [13] who studied visual
search as a partially observed Markov decision problem over
ﬁxed time horizons. In contrast, the works of Chernoff [2],
Naghshvar and Javidi [10]–[12], and this work model the

Let Ei denote the conditional expectation and let Pi denote the conditional probability measure under the hypothesis

Hi . Let D(qi qj ) denote the relative entropy between the
probability measures associated with the observations under
hypothesis Hi and hypothesis Hj under action a.
Let pi (0) denote the prior probability that hypothesis Hi
is true. The posterior probability that hypothesis Hi is true,
given the observations and actions till time n is denoted pi (n).
The beliefs p(n) = (p1 (n), . . . , pM (n)) admit the sequential
update

search problem as one of optimal stopping with controls.
b) Our contribution: We ﬁrst provide a mild extension
of Chernoff’s asymptotic optimality of expected delay for
his Procedure A by showing asymptotic optimality for all
moments. We then recognize that Chernoff’s solution suggests
a natural “neuronal metric” for the visual search problem that
is more appropriate than the L1 distance between the vectors
of ﬁring rates used in Sripati and Olson [1]. This metric is
closely related to the relative entropy between the Poisson
point processes associated with ﬁring rate vectors for the two
images. We do see a high correlation (r = 0.9) between speed
of discrimination and the new neuronal metric. While this is
lower than the correlation (r = 0.95) with the L1 metric
as observed by Sripati and Olson [1], we remark that our
abstraction is overly simplistic, and emphasize that our work
provides a more logical basis for the proposed neuronal metric
than the L1 distance.
c) Organization: In Section II we study the ASHT
problem. We ﬁrst set up the notation, state the assumptions,
and identify the performance criterion in sections II-A through
II-C. In section II-D we give an asymptotic lower bound for
the moments of the stopping time for all policies that satisfy
a constraint on the maximum possible conditional error cost.
In section II-E we show that a class of policies proposed by
Chernoff [2] and Naghshvar and Javidi [12] asymptotically
attain the lower bounds for general moments. In Section III, we
return to the visual search problem, and obtain the appropriate
metric for comparison with delays and identify the degree of
correlation.

A. Basic Notation

λ

Let Hi , i = 1, 2, . . . , M denote the M hypotheses of
which only one holds true. Let A be the set of all possible
actions which we take as ﬁnite |A| = K < ∞. Let X be
the observation space. Let (Xn )n≥1 and (An )n≥1 denote the
observation process and the control process respectively. We
assume that (An )n≥1 is a random or deterministic function of
the past observations and actions. Conditioned on action An
and the true hypothesis H, we assume that Xn is conditionally
independent of previous actions An−1 = (A1 , A2 , . . . An−1 )
a
and observations Xn−1 = (X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn−1 ). Let qi be the
probability density function with respect to some reference
measure µ for observation X under action a when Hi is the
true hypothesis. Let qi (Xn , An ) be the probability density,
with respect to a common reference measure µ⊗n ×unif(A)⊗n ,
of observations and actions till time n, where unif(A) is
the uniform distribution on A. Let Zij (n) denote the loglikelihood ratio (LLR) process of hypothesis Hi with respect
to hypothesis Hj , i.e.,

These are policies that meet a speciﬁed conditional error

a fact that follows by an easy application of Bayes rule.
A policy π is a sequence of action plans that at time n
looks at the history Xn−1 , An−1 and prescribes a composite
action that could be either (stop, d) or (continue, λ). If the
composite action is (stop, d), then d is the decision on the
hypothesis at the stopping time, and so d ∈ {1, 2, . . . , M }. If
the composite action plan is (continue, λ), then λ ∈ P(A) is
the distribution with which the next control is picked. Let τ be
the stopping time. Recall that (An )n≥1 is the control process
until the stopping time.
Given an error tolerance vector α = (α1 , α2 , . . . , αM ) with
0 < αi < 1, let ∆(α) be the set of policies

Assumption (I) implies that D(qi ||qj ) < ∞ and ensures that
no single observation can result in a reliable decision. Assumption (II) is an important technical assumption in our work. A

If p ≤ pi (n) < 1+L for some i, then An+1 (p) is chosen

according to λi , i.e., P (An+1 (p) = a) = λi (a).
L
• If pi (n) ≥ 1+L for some i, then the test retires and
declares Hi as the true hypothesis.
As mentioned earlier, we focus only on Procedure A. However,
we also consider the following variant of Procedure A for
j
analysis. Policy πP A (L) is same as πP A (L) except that it
L
stops only when pj (n) ≥ 1+L .
Deﬁnition 2.2: We deﬁne the following entities:
j
L
1) τP A (L) := inf{n : pj (n) ≥ 1+L } is the stopping time
at which the posterior belief of hypothesis Hj crosses the
j
detection threshold for policy πP A .
j
2) τP A (L) := minj τP A (L) is the stopping time for policy
πP A (L).
j
Observe that τP A (L) ≤ τP A (L) for all j.
Policy πP A is deﬁned to stop only when the posteriors
suggest a reliable decision. This is formalized now.
Proposition 2.3: For Policy πP A , the conditional probability of error under hypothesis Hi is upper bounded by
1
.
(7)
Pi (d = i) ≤
pi (0)(1 + L)

for Chernoffs Procedure A and Naghshvar and Javidi’s PolicyNJ (described in section II-E), which is required in many
proofs, is based on this assumption. Further it, ensures that
under all beliefs, there is a positive probability of choosing an
action that can distinguish hypothesis Hi from hypothesis Hj
(i = j). In particular, for any distinct i and j, there is at least
one control that can help distinguish the hypotheses Hi from
Hj .

•

C. Performance Criterion
We study the ASHT problem from the perspective of minimizing the expected stopping time delay subject to constraints
on the conditional probability of error, i.e., policies belonging
to ∆(α).
D. Lower Bound
The following proposition gives a lower bound for the mth
moment of the conditional stopping time given hypothesis Hi
for all policies belonging to ∆(α).
Proposition 2.1: Assume (I). Then for any π ∈ ∆(α) and
any m ≥ 1, we have

Ei [τ m ] ≥

| log

j=i

Di

αj |

m

(1 + o(1)) as α → 0.

Consequently πP A (L) ∈ ∆(α) if for every i we have
1
.
(8)
αi ≥
pi (0)(1 + L)
We now proceed towards identifying the time-delay performance of the policy πP A . Towards this, we ﬁrst consider the
i
easier to analyze policy πP A . Note that as L → ∞, we have
αi → 0, and therefore the policy has vanishing error cost.
However, the time taken scales to inﬁnity as given next.
i
Proposition 2.4: Assume (I) and (II). Consider policy πP A .
The following convergences then hold as L → ∞:

(6)
where Di is given in (5).
Proof: The proof for the case m = 1 follows from the
proof of [2, Th. 2, p. 768] with minor modiﬁcations to account
for the possibly different αj . (See also proof of [8, Lem 2.1,
Th 2.2]). For m > 1, the results follows from the fact that
Ei [τ m ] ≥ (Ei [τ ])m .
E. Achievability - Chernoff’s Procedure A and related policies
Chernoff [2] proposed a policy termed Procedure A and
showed that it has asymptotically optimal expected decision
delay. Naghshvar and Javidi [12] proposed a class of policies
(hereafter referred to as Policy-NJ), which are minor variants
of Procedure A. We shall now argue that both the above policies are asymptotically optimal for all moments of stopping
time. We consider only Procedure A. The result for Policy-NJ
follows from a similar analysis.

A sandwiching argument on the likelihood ratio about the

property of the stopping time τP A (L). We omit the complete
proof due to lack of space.

in the sense that, for each m ≥ 1, we have

• If pθ(n) (n) < 1+L , then An+1 (p) is chosen according
to λθ(n) , i.e., P (An+1 (p) = a) = λθ(n) (a).

• If pθ(n) (n) ≥ 1+L , then the test retires and declares
Hθ(n) as the true hypothesis.

III. A N A PPLICATION TO V ISUAL S EARCH
(i)
We now return to the visual search problem. In the visual
search task, a subject has to identify an oddball image from
amongst W images displayed on a screen (W = 6 in Figures
1(a) and 1(b)). With equal probability, the odd image can either
be image I1 or image I2 . When image I1 is the odd image,
the other W − 1 images are of type I2 and vice-versa. For the
purpose of modeling, we make the following assumptions. The
subject can focus attention on only one of the W positions,
and that the ﬁeld of view is restricted to that image alone.
Further, we assume that time is slotted and of duration T . The
subject can change the focus of his attention to any of the W
image locations, but only at the slot boundaries. We assume
that the subject would have indeed found the exact location
of the odd image and the image identity before mapping it to
a “left” or “right” decision. These are clearly oversimplifying
assumptions, yet our model and analysis provide some insights
into the visual search problem.
If the image in the focused location is Ii , we assume that
a set of d neurons sensitive to these images produce spike
trains, which constitute the observations. These are modeled
as d Poisson point processes of duration T with rates Ri =
(Ri (1), Ri (2), . . . , Ri (d)).
The visual search problem can be formulated as a 2W
hypothesis testing problem:

(ii)

i ≤ W, j ≤ W

D(f1 f2 ) a = i

a a
D(qi qj ) = D(f2 f1 ) a = j



D(qi qj ) = 0
a=j−W


D(f2 f1 ) a = i, a = j − W .

Our aim is to ﬁnd the optimum λi that maximizes
a a
λ(a)D(qi qj ).

Di = max min
λ

j=i

a∈A

The corresponding optimum Di thus obtained will yield the
required “neuronal metric” (after a further scaling). Due to the
symmetry in the problem, λi and Di will be the same under
all hypotheses Hi , i ≤ W , and similarly it will be the same
under all hypotheses Hi , i > W . Without loss of generality
we consider the case i ≤ W . Solution to the case when i > W
will have the same structure.
Theorem 3.1: Let i ≤ W . The optimum λi and Di are as
follows

Hi , i ≤ W : The odd image is I1 and is at location i
Hi , i > W : The odd image is I2 and is at location i − M

Di =
(W − 1)D(f1 f2 ) + (W − 3)D(f2 f1 )
λi (i) =

As the subject can change the point of focus at any slot
boundary we have an ASHT problem.
We now calculate the optimal λi and the optimal neuronal
metric Di for the visual search problem. Recall that the set
of controls A = {1, 2, . . . , W }. For notational simplicity let
fi denote the probability density on the observations when
focusing on image Ii , i = 1, 2 . The conditional probability
a
density function qi under hypothesis Hi when action a is
chosen is :

The proof is omitted due to lack of space. Note that the
lower bound in Naghshvar and Javidi [12] would have
max{D(f1 f2 ), D(f2 f1 )} as an upper bound for the neuronal metric, but our bound tightens it by a factor of two.
d) Empirical Study on Neuronal Data: We now apply
the results obtained in the previous section to the empirical
data obtained from the experiments of Sripati and Olson
[1]. Let T be the slot duration, during which one focuses
attention on a particular image. X is the space of counting
processes in [0, T ] with an associated σ-algebra. Let P1,T be
⊗d
the standard Poisson point process and let P1,T its d-fold
product measure. Let PRj ,T denote the probability measure

i ≤ W, a = i
i ≤ W, a = i

a
qi =

when D(f1 f2 ) >

∀j = i,

i > W, a = i − W
i > W, a = i − W

Indeed, under Hypothesis Hi with i ≤ W , the odd image is I1
and is at location i. If the control is to focus on location i, i.e.,
a = i, then the subject views image I1 and so the observations
have density f1 corresponding to I1 . The others are explained
similarly.
The relative entropy between the probability densities for
the various combinations of hypotheses and actions are:

duration T with rates R1 = (R1 (1), R1 (2), . . . , R1 (d)) and
R2 = (R2 (1), R2 (2), . . . , R2 (d)). Under an independence
assumption, the relative entropy between the vector Poisson
processes becomes the sum of relative entropies between the
individual processes. Then

A similar relation holds when image I2 is the target image.
The experimental data used in the empirical study consisted
of the following. 1) Neuronal ﬁring rate vectors were obtained
from the IT cortex of rhesus macaque monkeys for twelve
image pairs with the number of neurons ranging from 78 to
174 for different image pairs. 2) Reaction times statistics for
detection of the odd image were obtained from experiments on
human subjects. The neuronal behavioral index for an ordered
pair of images (i, j) is the inverse of average decision delay
minus a baseline delay. In Figure 2, we plot the behavioral
discrimination index (speed of discrimination or inverse of
time taken to decide) against the normalized per-unit-time perneuron neuronal metric. The correlation between behavioral
discrimination index and the neuronal metric was 0.90. This
is smaller than the correlation of 0.95 between the behavioral
discrimination index and the L1 distance between the neuronal
ﬁring rate vectors. The discrepancy might arise from the highly
simpliﬁed theoretical formulation, or from computational constraints in the brain. Nonetheless the close correspondence
with the data suggests that the neuronal metric proposed here
is a step in the right direction.
