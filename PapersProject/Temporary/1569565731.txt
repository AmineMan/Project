Abstract— Dense lattice packings can be obtained via the wellknown Construction A from binary linear codes. In this paper,
we use an extension of Construction A called Construction A′ to
obtain Barnes-Wall lattices from linear codes over polynomials
m
rings. To obtain the Barnes-Wall lattice BW2m in C2 for any
m ≥ 1, we ﬁrst identify a linear code C2m over the quotient
ring Um = F2 [u] um and then propose a mapping ψ : Um →
Z[i] such that the code L2m = ψ(C2m ) is a lattice constellation.
Further, we show that L2m has the cubic shaping property when
m is even. Finally, we show that BW2m canm obtained through
be
Construction A′ as BW2m = (1 + i)m Z[i]2 ⊕ L2m .

I. I NTRODUCTION
This paper addresses the construction of dense lattice packings [1] using linear block codes [2]. Towards explaining the
problem statement, we present a series of deﬁnitions used in
this paper. A complex lattice Λ is a discrete subgroup of Cn
[1]. Alternatively, Λ is a Z[i]-module generated by the vectors
{v1 , v2 , · · · , vn | vj ∈ Cn } as


n
∑

Λ=
qj vj | ∀qj ∈ Z[i] .


j=1

We refer to a set L as a lattice Euclidean code (or lattice
constellation) in Cn if L is a ﬁnite subset of lattice Λ.
It is well known that any set S in Cn has a one-one
¯
¯
correspondence to a set (denoted by S) in R2n as S =
{[ℜ(x) ℑ(x)] | ∀x ∈ S}. Using the above equivalence from C
to R, we make the following deﬁnition on a lattice Euclidean
code.
Deﬁnition 1: A lattice Euclidean code L ⊂ Λ is said to
¯
have the cubic shaping property if the corresponding set L
¯ ¯
can be written as L = Λ aZ2n , for some a ∈ Z.
The above deﬁnition implies that a lattice Euclidean code
L with cubic shaping property is a subset of Za [i]n for some
a ∈ Z, where Za is the ring of integers modulo a. Henceforth,
throughout the paper, a Euclidean code refers to a lattice
Euclidean code.
Deﬁnition 2: (Chapter 4 in [2]) We deﬁne the polynomial
quotient ring Um = F2 [u] um in variable u for any m ≥ 1
as
{m−1
}
∑
k
Um =
bk u | bk ∈ F2 ,
k=0

1

with regular polynomial addition and multiplication over F2
coefﬁcients along with the quotient operation um = 0, which
is equivalent to cancelling all the terms of degree greater than
or equal to m.
n
Deﬁnition 3: A subset of Um denoted by C is called a linear
code over Um if C can be obtained through a generator matrix
k×n
G ∈ Um as
{
}
k
C = zG | ∀z ∈ Um ,
for some k ≤ n and the matrix multiplication is over the ring
Um .
Using the above deﬁnitions, we now discuss the subject
matter of this paper. Systematic use of binary error-correcting
codes to construct some structured lattices is well known in the
literature [1]. For example, the checkerboard lattice D2 ⊂ R2
can be constructed as (Chapter 4, Section 7, [1])
D2 = 2Z2 ⊕ L,
where L = {ψ(c) | ∀c ∈ C} is an Euclidean code obtained by
embedding the codewords of C the repetition code (2, 1, 2)
over F2 = {0, 1} into the Euclidean space using the mapping
ψ : F2 → Z such that ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(1) = 1. Depending on
the structure of the underlying linear error correcting codes,
lattice construction can be categorized into different types [1].
In this paper, we consider a special class of constructions
called Construction A which is deﬁned formally as follows:
Deﬁnition 4: (Sec. 2, Chapter 5, [1]) A lattice Λ over Z is
obtained as Construction A from the binary linear code C if
Λ can be represented as
Λ = 2Zn ⊕ L,

(1)

where L = {ψ(c) | ∀c ∈ C} ⊂ Zn is an Euclidean code
obtained by the component-wise mapping ψ : F2 → Z given
by ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(1) = 1 on the alphabet of C.
In the above deﬁnition, the linear code C is restricted to
be over F2 and Λ is viewed as a lattice over Z. However,
in general, we could also view Λ as a complex lattice, i.e.,
as a lattice over Z[i], and construct Λ using linear code C
over ﬁnite rings. We introduce a new construction of lattices
by relaxing the constraint on the alphabet of the linear code
C. Our construction is an extension of Construction A and
hence, we refer it as Construction A′ . For the most generalized

deﬁnition of Construction A, we refer the reader to [3]. We
use an abstract ring R to denote either Z - the ring of integers
or Z[i] - the ring of Gaussian integers.
Deﬁnition 5: A lattice Λ over R is obtained through Construction A′ from the linear code C over the alphabet Um =
F2 [u] um for some m ≥ 1 if Λ can be represented as
Λ = um Rn ⊕ L,

(2)

where L = {ψ(c) | ∀c ∈ C} ⊂ Rn is an Euclidean code
obtained by using an appropriate mapping ψ : Um → R, and
{
2, if R = Z,
u=
1 + i, if R = Z[i].
Note that Construction A can be obtained as a special case
from Construction A′ when m = 1 and R = Z, wherein the
embedding operation ψ coincides with the one in Deﬁnition
4.
In this paper, we provide Construction A′ of Barnes-Wall
lattice [1], [4], [5], [6], [7] of dimension 2m for m ≥ 1 by
viewing it as a lattice over Z[i]. In other words, we present
the following key ingredients needed for Construction A′ of
Barnes-Wall lattices for every m ≥ 1:
1) An appropriate linear code C2m over the alphabet Um .
2) A suitable mapping ψ : Um → Z[i] in order to obtain
the Euclidean code L2m with cubic shaping property.
Throughout the paper, unless speciﬁed, the dimension of the
Barnes-Wall lattice refers to its rank as a lattice over Z[i].
We list the contributions and the organisation of the paper
as given below:
′
• We introduce Construction A of lattices (as in Deﬁnition
5) which facilitates us to generate some well structured
lattices from linear codes over ﬁnite rings. As an immediate application, we apply Construction A′ to obtain
Barnes-Wall lattices of dimension 2m by embedding a
linear code C2m over the quotient ring Um to a Euclidean
m
code in Z[i]2 for any m ≥ 1 (Section II)
• First, we identify the structure of the linear code C2m
by using Construction D of Barnes-Wall lattices. Subsequently, we provide a linear encoder to map the information bits onto the codewords of C2m . We identify that the
generator matrix for C2m is given by
[
]⊗m
1 1
G2m =
,
0 u

•

where the tensor operation is over Um (Section II). We
also prove the equivalence of our encoding technique to
Construction D (Section III).
To ﬁnd out ψ and L2m , we ﬁrst obtain the Euclidean code
m

EC 2m = {Φ(c) | ∀c ∈ C2m } ⊂ Z[i]2 ,

m

BW2m = (1 + i)m Z[i]2 ⊕ L2m .
More details on this work can be found in [8]. Apart
from providing further details on Construction A′ of
Barnes-Wall lattices, a thorough study on the performance
of Euclidean codes from Barnes-Wall lattice constellations
is also reported in [8].
Notations: Throughout the paper, boldface letters and capital boldface letters are used to represent vectors and matrices,
respectively. For a complex matrix X, the matrices XT , ℜ(X)
and ℑ(X) denote, respectively, the transpose, real part and
imaginary part of X. For a vector x, we use xj to represent the
j-th component of x. The set of all integers, the real numbers,
and the complex √
numbers are, respectively, denoted by Z, R,
and C, and i = −1. Cardinality of a set S is denoted by
|S|. Absolute value of a complex number x is denoted by |x|.

II. C ONSTRUCTION A′

OF

BARNES -WALL LATTICE

First, we recall Construction D of Barnes-Wall lattices, and
subsequently propose its Construction A′ from a suitable code.
A. Construction D of Barnes-Wall lattice
Barnes-Wall lattice can be obtained via Construction D [4]
as a Z[i] lattice as follows: Suppose we want to construct the
lattice BW2m of dimension 2m where m ≥ 1, let RM(r, m)
be the binary Reed-Muller (RM) code (Sec. 3.7, Chapter 3, [2])
of length 2m and of order 0 ≤ r ≤ m. With this, BW2m can
be constructed as in (3) given at the top of next page, where
ψ(·) is as given in Deﬁnition 4. For notational convenience,
we also write (3) as
m

BW2m = (1 + i)m Z[i]2 ⊕

m−1
⊕

(1 + i)r RM(r, m).

(4)

r=0

This method generates BW2m as a multi-level structure of
nested RM codes and hence it falls under Construction D [1].
Example 1: BW4 (which is also known as E8 over Z) is
constructed as
BW4 = (1 + i)2 Z[i]4 ⊕ (1 + i)RM(1, 2) ⊕ RM(0, 2),
where the code RM(1, 2) = (4, 3, 2) and the code
RM(0, 2) = (4, 1, 4) in the classical (n, k, dmin ) format.
Example 2: BW16 is obtained as

through the mapping Φ : Um → Z[i] as

with Φ(u) = 1 + i. At this stage, we point out that
EC 2m is an arbitrary subset of BW2m and does not have
cubic shaping. To ﬁx this problem, we provide a oneone mapping ϕ : EC 2m → L2m ⊂ BW2m such that L2m
has cubic shaping property for even values of m (Section
IV). With this, the mapping ψ (as in Deﬁnition 5) is the
composition mapping ϕ(Φ(·)) on Um , and we show that
BW2m is obtained as

BW16 = (1 + i)4 Z[i]16 ⊕ (1 + i)3 (16, 15, 2) ⊕
(1 + i)2 (16, 11, 4) ⊕ (1 + i)(16, 5, 8) ⊕ (16, 1, 6).

B. Construction A′

m

In order to obtain BW2m as Construction A′ , we ﬁrst need
to ﬁnd a suitable linear code C2m over an appropriate ring.
To ﬁnd such a code, we are interested in understanding the
following expression in (4),
EC 2m =

m−1
⊕

(1 + i)r RM(r, m),

(5)

r=0

as a single code. If we denote u = 1 + i and consider u as a
symbol, then the expression
m−1
∑

ur RM(r, m),

(6)

r=0

can be viewed as a code denoted by C2m over the ring Um .
Example 3: For BW4 , the code C4 is given by u(4, 3, 2) +
(4, 1, 4), which can be viewed as a code over the quotient
ring U2 .
Example 4: Another example is C16 , which is obtained
from BW16 and is given by
C16 = (16, 1, 6) + u(16, 5, 8) + u2 (16, 11, 4) + u3 (16, 15, 2),
where C16 is deﬁned over U4 .
In general, the ring on which the code
C2m =

m−1
∑

ur RM(r, m)

(7)

r=0

is deﬁned is the quotient ring Um . With this, we have identiﬁed
the linear code C2m to be useful for Construction A′ of BW2m .
In the rest of this subsection, we provide a linear encoder
to generate the codewords of C2m . It is known that the 2m dimensional Barnes-Wall lattice BW2m over Z[i] is generated
by the rows of the m-fold Kronecker product [6]
[
]⊗m

G=
.
0 (1 + i)
Replacing u = 1 + i as a symbol and making um = 0 in G,
we obtain the generator matrix G2m which can be viewed as
a matrix over Um .
Example 5: The generator matrix G4 is given by



 0 u 0 u 
4×4

G4 = 
 0 0 u u  ∈ U2 .
0 0 0 0
By using G2m as a matrix over Um , the code C2m is obtained
as below:

Encoding of C2m : Let z ∈ Um , i.e., the j-th component of
z is given by
m−1
∑
zj =
bk,j uk ,
(8)
k=0

where bk,j ∈ F2 for all k, j. Using z and G2m , the code
2m
C2m ⊂ Um can be obtained as
{
}
2m
C2m = x = zG2m | ∀z ∈ Um ,
(9)
where the matrix multiplication is over Um .
Proposition 1: The rate of the code C2m in bits per codeword is ( m )2m .
2
Proof: Each component of z carries m information bits
in the variables bk,j as shown in (8). This amounts to a
total of m2m bits carried by z. However, since the matrix
multiplication is over Um , not all the information bits bk,j are
encoded as codewords of C2m (due to um = 0). Using the
structure of G2m it is possible to identify the indices (k, j) of
information bits bk,j which get encoded into the codewords of
C2m as follows: Let the set Iq denote the indices of the rows
of G2m whose components take values from the binary set
{0, uq } for q = 0, 1, · · · m − 1. Due to the quotient operation
um = 0, the components of z which∑ in the index set Iq are
are
m−1−q
bk,j uk ∀j ∈ Iq .
restricted to be of the form, zj = k=0
∑m−1
k
For example, z1 =
k=0 bk,1 u and z2m = 0. Using the
m
structure of G2m we observe that |Iq | = Cq , and hence ﬁnd
the∑
total number of information bits on a codeword of C2m
m
m
as k=0 (m − k)Ck . Therefore, the rate of C2m in bits per
∑m−1 m
codeword is i=0 Ci (m − i) = m 2m .
2
We now provide an example for the proposed encoding
technique, showcasing the positions of the information bits
that get encoded to the codewords of C2m .

bits in the k-th row of B are encoded into a RM codeword
of (k − 1)-th order. Finally, on the multiplication of u from
left, the generated RM codewords are appropriately weighed
by powers of u and added. This proves the equivalence of our
construction to Construction D.
Till now, we have identiﬁed the linear code C2m and its
encoding technique over the quotient ring Um . In the next
subsection, we discuss embedding of C2m into the Euclidean

In this subsection, we prove the equivalence of our encoding
technique to Construction D. In other words, the following
theorem shows that the codewords generated in (9) can be
uniquely represented as vectors of a multi-level code of nested
RM codes as in (7).
Theorem 1: The codewords generated in (9) can be
uniquely represented as codewords obtained through Construction D.

It is to be noted that EC 2m is an arbitrary subset of BW2m and
does not have cubic shaping. To ﬁx this problem, we propose
a one-one mapping ϕ on EC 2m to obtain a new Euclidean code
denoted by L2m such that L2m has cubic shaping when m is
even. For any x = [x1 , x2 , x3 , · · · , x2m ] ∈ EC 2m , the mapping
ϕ operates on each component of x as,

From (15), note that each component of the vector in L2m is
in a cubic box and a rectangular box, when m is even and odd,
respectively. With this, the mapping ψ (given in Deﬁnition 5)
needed to obtain the Euclidean code L2m from C2m can be
written as
ψ = ϕ(Φ(·)),
(16)
where Φ and ϕ are given in (12) and (13) respectively.
Proposition 2: The rate of the Euclidean code L2m in bits
per complex dimension is m .
2
Proof: The proof follows from the one-one nature of ψ
and the result of Proposition 1. For the proof on the one-one
nature of ψ, we refer the reader to Proposition 2 of [8].
Remark 1: We point out that Construction A′ does not
qualify to be the generalized Construction A of [3] since the
proposed embedding operation ψ is not a linear map.
The following theorem shows that ψ retains the BarnesWall lattice structure on L2m and proves Construction A′ of
BW2m .
Theorem 2: The Euclidean code L2m and the lattice BW2m
m
are related as BW2m = (1 + i)m Z[i]2 ⊕ L2m .
Proof: Consider the case when m is even. From (3) and
(11), any z ∈ BW2m can be written as
z = (1 + i)m a + x,

(17)

Barnes-Wall lattice point. Further, the constants added in (14)
are such that
2

m−1
2

(1 − i) = a · (1 + i)m and 2

m−1
2

(1 + i) = b · (1 + i)m

for some a, b ∈ Z[i]. Therefore, φ(¯) continues to be a Barnesx
Wall lattice point. We also know that x = (1 + i)m r + ϕ(x),
m
for some r ∈ Z[i]2 and ϕ(x) ∈ L2m . Finally, from (15), we
have
m

(1 + i)m Z[i]2 ∩ L2m = 2

m−1
2

m

(1 + i)Z[i]2 ∩ L2m = {02m }.

The ﬁrst equality in the above equation follows as (1 + i)m
m−1
is of the form a2 2 where a = ±1 ± i. This completes the
proof when m is odd.
Using the results of Theorem 2, the Construction A′ of
m
BW2m is given by BW2m = (1 + i)m Z[i]2 ⊕ L2m , where
L2m is the Euclidean code obtained from C2m through the
mapping ψ = ϕ(Φ(·)) on Um .
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we have introduced an extension of Construction A to obtain the class of Barnes-Wall lattices from linear
codes over rings. We highlight that the mapping ψ provides
the cubic shaping property on the Euclidean code, which in
turn facilitates labelling of information bits if the Euclidean
code is to be used as a coded modulation scheme.

The R.H.S of (18) is in the form of (3) and hence L2m ⊂
BW2m . Further, combining (17) and (18), we have

The ﬁrst equality in the above equation follows from (19).
With (20) and (21), the statement of the theorem follows when
m is even.
We now consider the case when m is odd. For this case, we
