In [6] superposition coding was proposed for the binary
CCSI case for which random codes and maximum-likelihood
(ML) decoding is able to achieve capacity. Differently from
superposition coding, nested codes have been used for the binary SCSI case, and a technique based on nested parity check
codes has been proposed in [7] which asymptotically achieves
the rate-distortion bound for a Bernoulli symmetric source.
Recently, in [8] the authors present compound LDPC/LDGM
constructions for both problems which asymptotically achieve
capacity for the CCSI problem and the rate distortion bound
for the SCSI problem with bounded graphical complexity
under ML decoding. They show that these compound codes
essentially have a joint source-channel coding interpretation.
Further, polar codes have been shown to be asymptotically
optimal for both problems with bounded decoding complexity
[9]. However, their performance for practical block lengths is
worse than for other codes of the same length [10]. Finally,
other coding schemes for both SCSI and CCSI based on common modulation and coding schemes, as trellis coded quantization/modulation and turbo codes have been presented (see,
e.g., [6], [11], [12]).
The novel contribution of this paper is an algebraic framework which extends the above results for the binary SCSI and
CCSI cases to concatenated nested linear block codes. In particular, we show that by concatenating two linear block codes
new binary constructions can be obtained which preserve the
nested structure either of the outer or of the inner code. This
opens up a wide range of possible new code combinations
and indicates that code concatenation can alleviate the search
for both practical and optimal constructions. We analyze code
concatenations for q m -ary outer codes and q-ary inner codes
as a binary inner code can be simply obtained by q = 2.
Recent work by Guruswami and Rudra [13] gives an explicit
construction of folded RS (FRS) codes that can achieve list
decoding capacity. We show this result implies that if RS codes
are used as source codes, the rate-distortion bound is achieved
for IID q-ary sources. Together with the fact that concatenated
binary codes using outer FRS codes can achieve list decoding
capacity for concatenated codes [13], it motivates the use
of nested RS codes as outer codes in combination with list
decoding for both SCSI and CCSI problems. Finally, based on
our ﬁndings we exemplarily present an algebraic concatenated
nested coding scheme that asymptotically achieves the ratedistortion and capacity-rate bounds with low encoding and

Abstract—This work provides an algebraic framework for
source coding with decoder side information and its dual problem, channel coding with encoder side information, showing
that nested concatenated codes can achieve the corresponding
rate-distortion and capacity-noise bounds. We show that code
concatenation preserves the nested properties of codes and that
only one of the concatenated codes needs to be nested, which
opens up a wide range of possible new code combinations
for these side information based problems. In particular, the
practically important binary version of these problems can be
addressed by concatenating binary inner and non-binary outer
linear codes. By observing that list decoding with folded ReedSolomon codes is asymptotically optimal for encoding IID q-ary
sources and that in concatenation with inner binary codes it can
asymptotically achieve the rate-distortion bound for a Bernoulli
symmetric source, we illustrate our ﬁndings with a new algebraic
construction which comprises concatenated nested cyclic codes
and binary linear block codes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Two traditional problems in the ﬁeld of communications are
the Wyner-Ziv coding problem [1] and its dual version, the
Gel’fand-Pinsker problem [2], [3]. The ﬁrst is an instance of
distributed source coding: one source is encoded by taking advantage of the fact that the decoder receives another correlated
source as side information. In contrast, the Gel’fand-Pinsker
problem is a channel coding problem in which a channel
encoder embeds messages by using available channel state
information as side information [3]. We will refer to these
problems also as source coding with decoder side information
(SCSI) for the Wyner-Ziv case, and as channel coding with
encoder side information (CCSI) for the Gel’fand-Pinsker
problem in the following, respectively.
The duality of these problems has been studied in [4] for
the Gaussian case, where the authors also analyze how this
relationship can be exploited to design dual coset codes. While
nested lattice based coset coding schemes for these problems
have been proposed for continuous-input (Gaussian) channels
[5], in the following we focus on the binary version of these
problems, as this is beneﬁcial in many applications which cope
with binary data and communication channels, as for example
in digital watermarking for the case of CCSI and in distributed
video coding for SCSI.

B. Source coding with decoder side information
This problem addresses the compression of a symmetric
source W ∼ Bern( 1 ) by exploiting the knowledge of another
2
correlated source Y as side information at the decoder. The
correlation between sources can be represented as W = Y ⊕S
where S ∼ Bern(p) is a “separation” vector corresponding to
errors on a virtual BSC(p) modeling the correlation. For the
ˆ
estimate of the source sequence W we require a constraint on
the maximal distortion D, given as

II. N ESTED L INEAR B LOCK C ODES
These codes were ﬁrst proposed in [14] under the name
of partitioned cyclic codes and can be generally deﬁned as
follows.
Deﬁnition 1 (Nested Linear Block Code). A nested linear
N
block code C is deﬁned such that (i) C ⊂ F2 , (ii) C = C1 +C2 ,
(iii) C1 ∩ C2 = {0}, where C1 and C2 are subcodes.

It has been shown in [5], [6], [8] that nested codes are able
to achieve the rate-distortion bound for the SCSI problem and
symmetric Bernoulli sources and the capacity-noise bound for
the CCSI problem and binary symmetric channels (BSCs) as
communication channels, respectively. In the following, we
revise these results and the use of nested linear block codes
in these problems, where we focus on the binary case.

where dH (·) denotes the Hamming distance.
The encoder receives a sequence of N bits from source W ,
represented by W. It can be interpreted as
W = c + E,

A. Channel coding with encoder side information
For this problem, we consider a BSC with noise vector Z ∼
Bern(p) (BSC(p)) and interference S, representing the channel
N
state, which is uniformly distributed over F2 and known a
priori at the encoder. The channel output is given by
Y = E + S + Z,

where c ∈ C. We also require
≤ D due to (6), such
ˆ
that the stored version of W is given as W = c, otherwise an
encoder error is declared. We again assume that information
is conveyed in K1 dimensions of the N -dimensional vector
N
space F2 , corresponding to code C1 . Thus, the resulting
compression rate is K1 /N .
At the decoder, the encoded information of length K1 can
be recovered as a codeword in C1 of length N . Because the
decoder has access to side information Y it can recover c2
according to

(1)

c1 + Y

(8)

Lemma 2 ([8]). The overall compression rate of the scheme
under the distortion constraint in (6) is given as
K1 /N = h(p ∗ D) − h(D) − ϵ

(9)

for any ϵ > 0, where p ∗ D = p(1 − D) + D(1 − p) represents
binary convolution.

(3)

The rate K1 /N in (9) approaches the rate h(p ∗ D) − h(D)
of the rate-distortion bound RW Z (D, p) = l.c.e.{h(p ∗ D) −
h(D), (p, 0)}, where “l.c.e.” denotes the lower convex envelope. All other rates on the curve RW Z (D, p) can be obtained
by time sharing with the point (p, 0).

III. C ONCATENATION OF N ESTED C ODES
The results presented in Section II indicate that nested linear
block codes can asymptotically achieve the limits for both
SCSI and CCSI problems but does not address how practical
capacity-approaching codes for these cases can be obtained.
However, the asymptotically capacity-achieving results for
compound LDGM/LDPC codes in [8] suggests that code
concatenation may result in practical and efﬁcient codes for
these applications.
In this section we provide an new algebraic framework for
nested concatenated codes for which the constructions in [8]

Lemma 1 ([8]). The error probability in recovering c1 + c2
from Y approaches zero with increasing N under the constraint (2) for the transmitted codeword E if the maximal
message rate is given as
K1 /N = h(W ) − h(p) − ϵ.

ˆ
= W + c2 + W + S,
= c2 + E + S.

ˆ
The decoder can then reconstruct W by considering that c =
c1 + c2 .

with c1 ∈ C1 , such that E satisﬁes the constraint in (2).
Otherwise, an encoder error is declared. From (1) we obtain
the received vector as
Y = c1 + c2 + Z.

where E is the transmitted codeword under the input constraint

with wH (·) denoting the Hamming weight.
For encoding, we assume that without loss of generality
subcode C1 carries the information which is transmitted in
N
K1 dimensions of the N -dimensional vector space F2 . If
K = dim(C) according to property (ii) in Deﬁnition 1 we have
that K2 = dim(C2 ) where K = K1 + K2 . Note that a nested
parity-check code is simply a dual code of the nested generator
code CG (N, K, R) = C1 (N −K2 , K1 , R)+C2 (N, K2 , R+K1 )
[14].
For a given information vector encoded in C1 , there are 2K2
possible vectors in C2 . The encoder now has the task to ﬁnd
a vector c2 in C2 such that
S = c1 + c2 + E,

(6)

(5)

Note that (5) approaches the rates h(W ) − h(p) of
the capacity-noise bound RGP (W, p) = u.c.e.{h(W ) −
h(p), (0, 0)} where “u.c.e.” denotes the upper convex envelope. All other rates on the curve RGP (W, p) can be obtained
by time sharing with the point (0, 0).

ψ(u) = 0}, where Cq (nm, km) is the equivalent code C in
the underlying ﬁeld Fq . As ψ ∗ is one-to-one, ker(ψ ∗ ) = {0},
i.e., u = 0. Equivalently, ker(ϕ) = {0}, which means that
v = 0. But since C1 ∩ C2 = {0}, then v = 0 if and only
if v1 = v2 = 0. In other words, ψ ∗ (ϕ(C1 ∩ C2 = {0})) =
{ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 ))}v1 ∈C1 ∩ {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v2 ))}v2 ∈C2 = {0}.
By using a similar approach, it follows from Proposition 1
that its converse also holds, i.e., that the nested property is
preserved if the inner code is a nested q-ary linear block code
and the outer code is a Q-ary linear block code.

can be seen as special cases. In particular, we formally prove
that code concatenation preserves the nested code structure,
where the inner code serves as translator to a q-ary ﬁeld in
such way that the outer code operates in the corresponding q m ary extension ﬁeld. This especially also covers the practically
important binary case for q = 2.

Deﬁnition 2. Let ϕ : FQ → Fq , with Q = q m , be a bijective
n

linear map deﬁned as ϕ(v) = u, where v ∈ FQ and u ∈ Fq .
This means that a sequence of length n in FQ can be expressed
as a q-ary sequence of length nm. If m = 1 we have u = v
and there is no mapping.

Proposition 2. The concatenation between a linear code
C(n, k) over FQ and a linear code CΨ over Fq , CΨ =
CΨ1 + CΨ2 and CΨ1 ∩ CΨ2 = {0}, produces codewords of
an equivalent linear code Ceq (N, K) over Fq , such that

Deﬁnition 3. Let u = (u1 , ..., ul ) , ui ∈

where 1 ≤ l ≤ n and l is a divisor of mn. Further,
let CΨ (N/l, nm/l, dΨ ) be a q-ary linear block code. Then,
nm/l
ψ : Fq
→ CΨ is a bijective linear map such that
ψ(ui ) = ui GΨ , where GΨ is a generator matrix for CΨ .
This deﬁnition means that the sequence u is partitioned into
l groups of nm/l q-ary symbols that are each encoded by CΨ .
Note that this partition corresponds to an (nm/l)-folded code
nm/l
over Fq
. If l = n, then the groups have length m, and
are the q-ary representation of a Q-ary symbol. If l = 1, the
entire q-ary sequence u is encoded as a single input message
by CΨ .

Propositions 1 and 2 show that properties (i) and (ii) in
Deﬁnition 1 still hold after code concatenation, no matter
whether the nested code is an inner or outer code. The only
requirement is that both subcodes are concatenated with the
same outer code, in order to preserve property (ii). We deﬁne
the subcodes in the resulting q-ary nested structure of Ceq
as Ceq1 = {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 ))}v1 ∈C1 and Ceq2 = {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v2 ))}v2 ∈C2
which now instead can be employed in both the SCSI and the
CCSI cases.
IV. C ONCATENATED N ESTED C YCLIC C ODES AND
B INARY L INEAR B LOCK C ODES
When employing nested codes to the SCSI problem as in
Section II, Ceq2 is required to be a good channel code to correct
the error formed by the source encoding distortion and the
observation error. At the same time, Ceq must be a D-distortion
source code to output a codeword as close as possible to the
information sequence produced by the source with a distortion
constraint D. In the case of CCSI, Ceq2 takes on the role of
a good W -distortion source code whereas Ceq is the channel
code.
While channel coding can be performed by means of
good decoding algorithms, performing source coding with
error correcting codes makes it necessary to have complete
algorithms that can return the nearest codewords. Motivated
by recent results on list decoding of RS codes we will now
study the suitability of these codes for source encoding.

Deﬁnition 4. We deﬁne the extended one-to-one linear map
nm
N
ψ ∗ : Fq
→ Fq as ψ ∗ (u)
(ψ(u1 ), . . . , ψ(ul )) =
(u1 GΨ , . . . , ul GΨ ).
Lemma 3. Let v be a codeword of the nested linear block
code C(n, k, d) over FQ with Q = q m and C = C1 +
C2 . The concatenation between C and CΨ (N/l, nm/l, dΨ )
yields an equivalent code Ceq (N, K, D) over Fq according
to Ceq (N, K, D) = {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v))}v∈C where K = km and
D ≥ dΨ d.
The proof follows in a straightforward way from sequential
concatenation [15]. Note that ϕ(v) is a q-ary codeword of
Cq (nm, km, dq ), which is the q-ary version of C in the
underlying ﬁeld Fq .
The following proposition represents the main result of this
section and states that the nested property as stated in Deﬁnition 1 is preserved if the outer code is a nested q-ary linear
block code and the inner code is a Q-ary linear block code.
Proposition 1. The concatenation between C and CΨ produces
codewords of an equivalent linear code Ceq (N, K) over Fq ,
such that
1) Ceq (N, K) = {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 ))}v1 ∈C1 + {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v2 ))}v2 ∈C2 ,
2) {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 ))}v1 ∈C1 ∩ {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v2 ))}v2 ∈C2 = {0}.
Proof: 1) According to Lemma 3 we have Ceq =
{ψ ∗ (ϕ(v))}v∈C . Since C = C1 + C2 , then Ceq = {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 +
v2 ))}v1 ∈C1 ;v2 ∈C2 . But as ψ ∗ and ϕ are a linear maps and both
n
C1 and C2 are also subspaces over the ground ﬁeld Fq , as FQ is
nm
equivalent to Fq , the additivity property of linear mappings
yields {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 + v2 ))}v1 ∈C1 ;v2 ∈C2 = {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 ))}v1 ∈C1
+ {ψ ∗ (ϕ(v2 ))}v2 ∈C2 .
2) We deﬁne the kernel of ψ ∗ to be ker(ψ ∗ )

A. List decoding for folded Reed-Solomon codes
In [13], Guruswami and Rudra describe an explicit family
of codes with a list decoding algorithm that can asymptotically
achieve the information-theoretic limit of list decodability,
with encoding and decoding performed in polynomial time.
The proposed codes are folded RS codes, which can be seen
as standard RS codes viewed as codes over a larger alphabet.

Fq be a primitive element of Fq . Let n′ ≤ q − 1 be a multiple

{u ∈ Cq |

of ν and 1 ≤ k < n. An FRS code C (ν) (n′ , k) over alphabet
ν
Fq is a folded version of the RS code C(n, k) over Fq and is
deﬁned as

ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq , where q = 2m . The polynomial xn − 1 can be
factorized as
xn − 1 = g(x)(r) f (x)(k1 ) h(x)(k2 ) ,

{([i(αjν ), i(αjν+1 ), ..., i(αjν+ν−1 )], 0 ≤ j < n′ ) |
deg(i(x)) < k, i(x) ∈ Fq [x]}, (10)

(11)

where r = n − (k1 + k2 ). The notation “a(x) ” is used to
indicate the degree of polynomial “a(x)”, and henceforth the
argument “(x)” will be omitted in order to simplify notation.
Note that for m = 1 we obtain BCH codes, otherwise RS
codes are employed.
The polynomial g (r) corresponds to a generator polynomial
of the code C(n, k1 + k2 ), and (gf )(r+k1 ) is a generator polynomial for C2 (n, k2 ). The codewords in C can be expressed
as a sum of codewords as follows:
(·)

where n′ = n/ν. In other words, a FRS code is an RS code
where ν consecutive symbols each are grouped together.
The GR algorithm for FRS codes of rate R allows to list
decode in polynomial time up to a fraction of (1 − R − ε)
worst-case errors. The folding operation does not change the
rate of the RS code (R = k/n = k/n′ ν), thus e′ ν/n =
1 − k/n − ε, so e = e′ ν is the number of correctable errors
for the corresponding unfolded RS code [13].

v (n−1) = i1

Proposition 3. If the GR list decoding algorithm is used
in conjunction with RS codes for source encoding of IID qary sources, the probability of encoding errors asymptotically
vanishes.

C. Construction for the CCSI case
(k −1)

At the outer encoder, information i1 1
is encoded using
(n−1)
(r)
g of code C(n, k1 + k2 ), producing v1
(zero padded to
achieve length n) of the shortened cyclic code C1 (n − k2 , k1 ).
In order to allow incorporating binary side information, the
sequence v1 ∈ C1 is mapped to its binary representation u1 ,
which is then partitioned into l groups of nm/l bits that are
each encoded by a BLBC code CΨ (N/l, nm/l). Thus, the
resulting codewords c1 = ψ ∗ (ϕ(v1 )) have length N and are
codewords in Ceq1 (N − K2 , K1 ).
Encoding steps: I) (Outer encoding): Encode information
(k −1)
using the generator g (r) for C(n, k1 +k2 ), thus produci1 1
(n−k −1)
ing a codeword v1 2
of C1 (n − k2 , k1 ) padded with k2
zeros; II) (Code concatenation): Encode l groups of nm/l bits
of codeword v1 (received from the outer encoder) by using the
inner code CΨ , resulting in c1 ; III) Compute S − c1 ; IV) Find
c2 ∈ Ceq2 according to (3) such that (2) holds; V) Transmit E.
Note that the encoding complexity is essentially given by
step IV, because all other operations are linear. For FRS codes
a folding/unfolding step has to be performed before ﬁnding
v2 ∈ C2 (n, k2 ) as follows.

Proof: Starting from an observation that the normalized
covering radius t(C)/n of a linear code C(n, k) [16] is
t(C)/n ≤ 1 − k/n, which is met with equality by RS codes,
we see that e = t(C) − ε, where ε > 0, C(n, k) is the unfolded
RS code and t(C) is its covering radius. Because a fraction
ν
of errors over Fq is equivalent to a fraction of errors over
Fq , the GR algorithm for FRS codes asymptotically corrects a
number of errors over Fq that is equal to the covering radius
of the corresponding unfolded RS code.
Note that list decoding may not output a single codeword
but a list of possible codewords. This does not pose a problem
since the source encoder can always pick the one which is
closest to the source sequence in Hamming distance.
Using concatenated codes for both the CCSI and the SCSI
problems, there are two different ways of implementing the
source encoding step of ﬁnding a vector c2 ∈ Ceq2 and
c ∈ Ceq , respectively. The ﬁrst way is to perform separate
source encoding for each of the concatenated codes. While
RS outer codes in conjunction with the GR algorithm can
n
optimally perform source encoding in Fq , the performance of
this strategy also depends on the inner code. Another way is to
perform source encoding over the concatenated binary code.
In fact, list decoding capacity for binary codes can be asymptotically achieved if FRS codes are concatenated with random
binary linear block codes (BLBC) [13]. This means that every
Hamming sphere of radius h−1 (1 − R − ε) has polynomially
many codewords. Thus, it is possible to asymptotically achieve
the rate-distortion bound for a Bernoulli symmetric source.
In the following we provide a general setup which universally addresses the scenario of outer algebraic RS or BCH
codes and arbitrary inner BLBCs.

Proposition 4. Consider a symmetric Bernoulli source. Source
encoding via list decoding of RS/BLBC code Ceq2 can asymptotically achieve a vanishing probability of encoding error.
Thus, given a concatenated RS/BLBC channel code Ceq which
asymptotically achieves capacity on the BSC(p), the resulting
joint source-channel coding scheme for the CCSI case achieves
the capacity-noise bound RGP (W, p).
Proof: From the rate distortion bound for a symmetric
Bernoulli sequence, the rate for the W -distortion source code
Ceq2 is given as K2 /N ≥ 1−h(W ). Because list decoding can
asymptotically correct an error fraction of h−1 (1 − R2 − ε),
we see that R2 = 1 − h(W ) − ε asymptotically achieves the
rate-distortion bound and therefore results in an encoding error
probability which asymptotically tends to zero. Therefore, if
the RS/BLBC code Ceq achieves capacity on the BSC(p), we

B. Nested cyclic codes
The coding scheme for the outer code is based on an
algebraic construction of nested cyclic codes. These codes
form an ideal in the polynomial ring Fq [x]/(xn − 1), where
Fq [x] is the set of polynomials in x with coefﬁcients from the

4

have R = 1 − h(p) − ε which results in R1 = h(W ) − h(p).
This is equivalent to the capacity-noise bound RGP (W, p).
The channel coding performance of the proposed scheme
is essentially the one for the chosen concatenated RS/BLBC
code Ceq2 . Here we can exploit the fact that some constructions
(e.g., RS/LDPC) are capacity approaching, for which effective
decoding algorithms exist.
After transmission of E, the decoder receives Y in (1) and
the error vector Z is corrected in the same fashion as in any
standard concatenated scheme (by using the corresponding
decoding algorithms for each code), resulting in an error-free
codeword (12). Then, the embedded information i1 is extracted
by a modulo operation and a polynomial division according
to

source-channel codes. Therefore, the optimal asymptotic performance for both binary SCSI and CCSI problems can be
universally achieved by concatenation with a linear block code,
provided that one of the constituent codes has the necessary
nested property. In particular, while in [8] ML decoding is
assumed, through a novel RS/BLBC construction with low
encoding and decoding complexity we show that list decoding
provides the optimal source encoding performance asymptotically for both problems. At the same time, for channel
error correction any capacity-approaching algorithm can be
independently used.
It is still a challenge to exploit the full potential of concatenation with practical list decoding algorithms, but separate
source and channel encoding is a feasible approach as practical
encoding and decoding algorithms exist for each code. Future
work will focus on studying other concatenated schemes
employing QC-LDPC, polar, and BCH codes as outer codes,
which seems to be a promising avenue since these codes have
been successfully employed for source coding [9], [15], [17].

D. Construction for the SCSI case
The encoder receives a sequence of N bits from a Bernoulli
symmetric source W , represented by W, which is equivalent
ˆ
to a codeword W = c in Ceq (N, K) plus a “quantization”
ˆ
error E (7). An encoder error is declared if a codeword W = c
cannot be found.
Encoding steps: I) Receive W, recover v ∈ C; II) Com(k −1)
as in (13).

Analogous to the CCSI case, for FRS codes an extra
folding/unfolding step must be performed before ﬁnding v ∈
C(n, k), with the difference that now the folded codeword
is v ′ ∈ C (ν) (n′ , k), so σ ∗ (v ′ ) = v. We have the following
statement which is analogous to Proposition 4.

Proposition 5. Consider a symmetric Bernoulli source. Source
encoding via list decoding of RS/BLBC code Ceq can asymptotically achieve a vanishing probability of encoding error.
Thus, given a concatenated RS/BLBC channel code Ceq2 which
asymptotically achieves capacity on the BSC(p ∗ D), the
resulting joint source-channel coding scheme for the SCSI case
achieves the rate-distortion bound RGP (W, p).
(k −1)

The encoder extracts a polynomial i1 1
of length k1 (K1
bits) from v (n−1) (12), so the compression rate is K1 /N .
The encoding steps in this case are essentially the same as
the decoding steps of CCSI, but instead of channel decoding
we employ source encoding algorithms which dominate the
encoding complexity (see encoder step I).
For decoding, the steps are analogous to the encoding steps
of the CCSI case, with the difference that S becomes Y, and
instead of sending the error pattern after ﬁnding c2 ∈ Ceq2 ,
the information word corresponding to the actual codeword
ˆ
W = c1 + c2 is stored. Here, channel decoding is employed
which dominates the complexity as all other operations are
linear.
V. C ONCLUSION
Within the proposed algebraic framework we proved that
code concatenation preserves the nested structure of joint
