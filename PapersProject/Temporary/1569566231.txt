by nearby relays. A ﬁrst step in this direction was taken in
[6] where the performance gain of adding a –full-duplex–
single-relay to only one node of the network was studied. This
setup was somewhat limited because the expressions derived
did not measure network-wide performance, specially did not
quantify the interference added in the network resulting from
the relays. We now consider a network formed of clusters
with source-relay-destination nodes which use the decodeand-forward (DF) scheme [2] in a full-duplex fashion and
clusters with source-destination pairs which employ direct
transmission (DT). Assume that CSI is not available at the
source nodes, which may arise in wireless environments. Each
source decides to activate or not a relay node randomly with
the same probability, and independent of all network parameters. Regarding the relay position two different scenarios are
considered:
• The relays are located at a ﬁxed relative distance with
respect to their sources,
• Every source chooses its nearest neighbor (NN) as its relay (a reasonable assumption when using the DF scheme).
In this last case the relay is randomly located which means that
in all the clusters the relays are in different positions and that
we need to average over all possible relay positions to derive
the OP. The network is modeled as an independently marked
Poisson point process, limited by the signal-to-interference
ratio (SIR) where signal attenuation occurs both through
path loss and Rayleigh fading. An outage event is declared
whenever the distribution of nodes or fading causes the target
rate to be higher than the achievable (with Gaussian signaling)
DF rate [2]. Hence the probability of these events (OP) become
an upper bound on the asymptotic error probability.
The main contributions are twofold. First, tight approximations for the OP, which lend themselves to analysis, are
derived for the small OP regime. Secondly, we determine the
optimal relay activation probability (in terms of OP) which
provides the trade-off between the reliability gain obtained
from cooperation and the interference introduced. From a
different perspective, this also addresses the question whether
or not to cooperate.

Abstract—This paper investigates the potential gain of cooperation in large wireless networks with multiple sources and relays,
where the nodes form an homogeneous Poisson point process. The
source nodes may choose their nearest neighbor from the set of
inactive nodes as their relay. Although cooperation can potentially lead to signiﬁcant improvements on the asymptotic error
probability of a communication pair, relaying causes additional
interference in the network, increasing the average noise. We
address the basic question: how should source nodes optimally
balance cooperation vs. interference to guarantee reliability in
all communication pairs. Based on the decode-and-forward (DF)
scheme at the relays, we derive closed-form approximations to the
upper bounds on the error probability, averaging over all node
positions. Surprisingly, in the small outage probability regime,
there is an almost binary behavior that dictates –depending on
network parameters– the activation or not of all relay nodes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In order to cope with the increasing trafﬁc demands future
wireless networks must employ strategies which provide an
optimal use of resources such as bandwidth and power. Over
the past decade, there has been great interest in cooperative
networks [1] where relay nodes can be exploited as a means
to increase throughput and reliability. Although the capacity
of the single-relay channel [2] remains unsolved and its
optimal coding scheme unknown, signiﬁcant progress has
been made in quantifying the performance gains obtained
from cooperation. The information-theoretic research in this
topic was mainly focused on simple networks with few nodes
or ﬁxed topologies where perfect channel state information
(CSI) can be available to all terminal nodes. Finding explicit
capacity regions of large networks may be –if feasible– very
hard. To tackle this limitation, spatial models employing tools
from stochastic geometry and graphs, provide a comprehensive
framework for the analysis of large wireless networks with
little interference management [3], [4]. In this setup, the interference between users is treated as noise [5] whose statistical
properties depend on the particular spatial distribution of the
nodes and fading realizations of the wireless paths.
In this paper, we study upper bounds –in terms of the
outage probability (OP)– on the asymptotic error probability
of large wireless networks in which the sources are aided

(α > 2) is the usual path loss function and |hxy |2 is the
power gain of Rayleigh fading with unit mean.
• An additional source with the same marks as the oth˜
ers, independent of the point process Φs and with its
destination at d = [D, 0], is added at the origin. The
position of the relay for this source node will be r
(distributed as a degenerate RV or distributed with the NN
distribution). The coefﬁcients |hsr |2 , |hrd |2 and |hsd |2
model the source-relay, relay-destination, and sourcedestination fading coefﬁcients of this cluster, respectively.
• hxi r , hki r and hxi d , hki d model the fading gains between
each source and its relay and the relay of the source at
the origin, and between each source and its relay and the
destination node of the source at the origin, respectively.
The interferences affecting the typical cluster depend on two
path losses from each cluster (e.g. at the destination, lxi ,d and
lxi +ki ,d ) and for this, the OP cannot be obtained in closed
form. Hence, we approximate the path loss from the clusters
out of the origin to the relay and destination at the origin
by a single path loss: lxi ,d ≈ lxi +ki ,d ≈ lxi +τ ki ,d , and
lxi ,r ≈ lxi +ki ,r ≈ lxi +τ ki ,r , with 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1. This assumes
that the intra-cluster distance is much smaller than the intercluster distance, while retaining the independent fading paths
[7]. Interference powers are approximated as:

II. P ROBLEM D EFINITION
A. Homogeneous Relay Network
Consider a planar network in which source nodes attempt
to transmit a message to their destinations in the presence of
a single –full-duplex– relay node. The sources are modeled as
a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) Φs of intensity
λs , and initially we assume that each source chooses its relay
from an independent HPPP Φin of intensity λin , although
later we shall introduce some simplifying hypothesis. This is
equivalent to assuming that nodes from a set Φ forming a
HPPP of intensity λs +λin choose to access the network using
slotted ALOHA [3] with transmit probability λs /(λin + λs ),
while the remaining nodes serve as potential relays.
A central issue is how and whether a source should decide to
activate a relay. Obviously, provided that local CSI is available
at the sources this must be done taking into account both local
criteria, to satisfy the cluster’s needs, but at the same time on
a global scale to maximize network throughput. To simplify
the treatment we assume that there is no CSI available at the
source nodes and hence they choose to activate a relay with
a ﬁxed probability pr independent of all other nodes. Another
important issue is how a relay is chosen from available nodes.
We shall consider two cases:
• The relays are at a ﬁxed relative position from their
source, that is, the relay for a source node x is positioned
at x + k, where k is a ﬁxed vector,
• The relays are chosen by the sources from the set of
inactive nodes Φin .
The ﬁrst case is considered for mathematical tractability and
because the optimal regions where to look for a relay can be
derived. With respect to the second case, it is reasonable to
assume that sources will choose their relay using whatever
little local knowledge of the network they possess. Moreover,
since the focus will be on coding schemes that perform better
when the relay is closer to the source, we propose that each
source that uses a relay will attempt to use its NN from the
set Φin . Although this will be beneﬁcial in most cases, it does
not avoid the possibility of two sources choosing the same
node as a relay. Nevertheless, assuming a reasonable small
outage probability regime the density of sources will be much
smaller than that of the potential relays and the probability
of conﬂicts will be negligible. With these simpliﬁcations, the
existence and location of all the relays becomes independent
for each source and we can simply include the position of the
NN of each source as a mark, simplifying the model.
With the above hypothesis we can model the network as an
independently marked Poisson point process:
˜
Φs = {(xi , δx , ki , hx r , hx d , hk r , hk d )} , where:

B. Achievable Bounds on the Asymptotic Error Probability
A complex Gaussian point-to-point code1 -Cn (n, Mn ) for the
homogeneous relay network [5] consists of a set of randomly
and independently generated codewords {ϕ(1), . . . , ϕ(Mn )},
each according to an i.i.d. Gaussian RV of unit variance. We
assume each source (resp. to relay) uses a code with each
receiver assigning an estimate of its message to the received
output. The smallest asymptotic average (over all random
parameters) probability of error of every pair source-receiver

Decode-and-Forward [2] allows the relay to decode the
messages sent by the source, re-encode them, and forward
them to the destination. The encoder cannot optimize the rate
R since it is unaware of the instantaneous interference and

The positions of the sources constitute the HPPP Φs =

The Bernoulli random variable (RV) δxi indicates that
source xi uses a relay, an event with probability pr .

fading coefﬁcients involved. We will assume that the encodingdecoding scheme used is regular encoding and sliding-window
decoding [1] with Gaussian signaling. In this way, the variances of the interferences –conditioned to the marked Poisson
process– are given by (1). Fixed a rate R, the asymptotic
¯
error probability Pe (R) is dominated by the outage probability
(OP) of any achievable rate. In particular, we focus on the DF
scheme, for which

where δ0 = 1 indicates the source at the origin uses the relay

rd

Notice that the tightness is given by the quality of the sourcerelay link. If λs δ r 2 is small enough, (6) will be very tight,
and both (4) and the true Pout (R, pr ) will be concave. Again,
remark that a small λs δ r 2 is coherent with the use of
the path loss approximation, the union bound and condition
(5) (the relay will typically be closer to the source than the
destination). Finally, a concave function on a bounded and
closed interval [x1 , x2 ] attains its minimum at x1 or x2 .
Thus lemma 2 states that the best OP for any cluster in the
network can be attained when all (pr = 1) or none (pr = 0)
of the sources decide to use their neighbors as relays. This
is somewhat surprising: there is no optimal trade-off between
cooperating and introducing interference; cooperating can be
beneﬁcial or detrimental to all. Each of these scenarios is
determined by the network parameters (α, D, r, λs , R, etc).
In order to obtain more insightful results let us consider
2
that ∆ ≡ λs δ 1 + α is small, which will be the typical
operating regime. Also consider that r ≤ D and r − d
will be comparable to D to obtain the following.
Lemma 3 (small OP regime): As ∆D2 (and ∆ r − d 2 )
goes to zero we have:

The event A(R) means that the relay is in outage and the event
B(R) means that the destination is in outage when source
and relay can cooperate. T = 2R − 1 and ρ is the complex
correlation coefﬁcient between the symbols transmitted by the
source and the relay. Although DF allows for the optimization
of ρ [6], we shall restrict ourselves to the case ρ = 0. In the
small outage regime it can be proved that this is the optimal
value [6]. Furthermore, ρ = 0 simpliﬁes the operation of
the network, because the source and its relay do not need
to transmit synchronously [1].
III. OP: R ELAY AT A F IXED P OSITION
Let ADT (R) = |hsd |2 lsd < T Id denote the event that
DT fails. Conditioning on δ0 we can write the OP as:
Pout (R, pr ) = P {A(R) ∪ B(R)|δ0 = 1} P {δ0 = 1}
+ P {ADT (R)|δ0 = 0} P {δ0 = 0} . (2)
Although (2) can be solved (even without the path loss
approximation) in terms of the (joint) Laplace transform of the
interference RVs [8], they can only be computed numerically
[6] and it is difﬁcult to carry out an analysis. To overcome this
we introduce the union bound on the DF outage event, which
is very tight when the relay is close to the source, since B(R)
dominates over A(R). In this way we can write:

Pout (R, pr ) ≤ m(pr )+O max

P {δ0 = 1} + P {ADT (R)|δ0 = 0} P {δ0 = 0} . (3)
Lemma 1 (upper bound on the OP): Assuming the relays
are ﬁxed at a relative position r with resp. to the sources,
the OP can be upper bounded as follows

and λs δ r 2 is small enough, we have that Pout (R, pr ) attains
its minimum value when pr = 0 or pr = 1.
Proof: Since under (5) the second derivative of the last
two terms in (4) is negative, we can show that they are concave
functions of pr [9]. When λs δ r is small, the ﬁrst term, which
quantiﬁes the outage behavior of the source-relay link, can be
tightly bounded by concave functions of pr ∈ [0, 1] as:

It is interesting to observe that B(α, d) ⊂ A(α, d), so in a

In the previous section the optimal choice of pr depended

on the set of parameters (α, λs CT 2/α 1 + α D2 , r). In the
random relay setup, the position of the relay is different in
each cluster, and as we shall see, the optimal choice of pr will
depend on the set of parameters: (α, λs CT 2/α D2 , σin /D),
that is, it will now depend on the relative distance to neighbors
(σin ) with respect to the transmission distance D. To derive
the OP we have to average with respect to δ0 and the position
of the NN of the origin, r. Doing this for ρ = 0, and using

determine the values of σin /D covers the small outage regime
(e.g. when λs δD2 < 1/4 the OP with DT will be smaller than

in this regime there is large range of σin /D for which the OP
is concave, and in a large subset of this set pr = 1 is optimal,
that is, we have identiﬁed the practical setups in which the OP
is concave, and a region in which pr = 1 is optimal.

Fig. 1 shows the OP for the ﬁxed relay case for d = [10 0]
when the relay is at r = [3 3] and r = [5 4]. The curves labeled
as exact were obtained through numerical simulation of the
exact expressions of the OP for this case, which do not have a
closed form expression, while the approximations come from
(4). The performance of DT (independent of pr ) is also shown.
We see that (4) is very tight for practical OP values and that
when the relay is sufﬁciently close to the source (r = [3 3]) all
sources should use DF, while when the relay is farther away
(r = [5 4]) they should use DT. This is because as the relay
is farther away from the source the OP associated with the
relay decoding, although small, has a greater inﬂuence. Hence,
interference is introduced in the network, but the cooperation is
insufﬁcient to diminish its effect. In Fig. 2 we see the boundary
of the regions where the relays have to be so that pr = 1
is optimal, obtained using the exact outage probability, the
approximate expression (4) and function m(pr ). We see that
the obtained simpliﬁed expressions are in excellent agreement
with the true behavior given by the exact expressions.
In Fig. 3 we show the OP as a function of pr when the
relays are chosen as the nearest neighbors of the sources using
d = [10 0], α = 4 and λs = 10−4 for two different values
of σin : one in which pr = 1 is optimal and another in which
pr = 0. We compare them against Montecarlo simulations
of the Poisson process, which was simulated from the model
without the path loss approximation. We see that in particular
using (11) in (9) yields the best approximation to the OP.
Finally in Fig. (4) we ﬁx α = 3 and ﬁnd the set of points
(λs δD2 , σin ) for which the OP is a concave function in pr
and for which pr = 1 is optimal, both through numerical
simulation of the exact OP and using (12) and (13). We see on
one hand that these expressions cover the small outage regime
(e.g. when λs δD2 < 0.1 the OP with DT will be smaller than
0.1 [3]) and that they predict quite well the actual regions of
concavity on the OP an the region of optimality of pr = 1.

VI. S UMMARY AND D ISCUSSION
In this paper we discussed the limits of cooperation on
homogeneous wireless relay networks. The most signiﬁcant
contribution of the work is the conclusion, that in the small
OP regime using DF, and depending of certain network
parameters, it is best to cooperate or not at all for all the
clusters in the network. That is, there is no overall gain if
some clusters are permitted to cooperate and others not. This
result follows from the fact that when a cluster decides to use a
relay it will introduce more interference in the network. While,
