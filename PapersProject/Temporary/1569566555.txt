Distributed Computing With Privacy
Himanshu Tyagi†

In this paper, we give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for
secure computation of given functions. We extend the results
of [10] and identify appropriate quantities R∗ to establish
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions of the same form as (1)
and (2), respectively, for a broad class of settings involving
the secure computation of multiple functions. The simpler
case when the computed functions g1 , ..., gm correspond to
the observations of subsets of terminals is studied separately
as a problem of secure multiterminal source coding.
Under the sufﬁcient condition (2), the secure computing
scheme in [10] recovered the entire data at the (function seeking) terminals in A using communication that is independent
of G0 . Similarly, when one of the terminals computes the
private function g0 , i.e., gi = g0 for some i ∈ M, our secure
computing scheme enables the recovery of entire data at the
terminal i.
Unlike [10], we do not provide a single-letter formula for the
quantity R∗ , in general; nevertheless, conditions (1) and (2)
provide a structural characterization of securely computable
functions. Moreover, for special cases the conditions do take
a single-letter form (see Example 1 and Corollary 4 below).
The problem of secure computing for multiple functions is
formulated in the next section, followed by our main results
in section III. Partial proof of our main result is sketched in
the last section.

Abstract—A set of terminals that observe correlated data
seek to compute functions of the data using interactive public
communication. At the same time it is required that this
communication, observed by an eavesdropper, does not reveal
the value of a private function of the data. In general, the
private function and the functions computed by the terminals
can be all different. We show that a class of functions are
securely computable if and only if the conditional entropy of
data given the value of private function is greater than the least
rate of interactive communication required for an appropriately
chosen multiterminal source coding task. A single-letter formula
is provided for this rate in special cases.

I. I NTRODUCTION
We consider the following problem of distributed function
computation under privacy constraints. The terminals in a
set M = {1, ..., m} observe correlated data, and wish to
compute functions g1 , ..., gm , respectively, of their collective
data. To this end, they communicate interactively over a
noiseless channel of unlimited capacity. It is required that this
communication must not reveal the value of a speciﬁed private
function g0 of the data. If such a communication protocol
exists, the functions are said to be securely computable. We
formulate a Shannon theoretic multiterminal source model that
addresses the basic question: When are the functions g0 , ..., gm
securely computable?
The answer to the general question above is not known.
The case when the terminals in subset A of M compute
only the private function g0 and those not in A perform
no computation was dealt with in [10]. Loosely speaking,
denoting the collective data of the terminals by the random
variable (rv) XM and the random value of the function g0 by
the rv G0 , the maximum rate of randomness (in the data) that
is independent of G0 is H (XM |G0 ). It was shown in [10]
that if g0 is securely computable (by the terminals in A), then
H (XM |G0 ) = H (XM ) − H (G0 ) ≥ R∗ ,

Notation. The set {1, ..., m} is denoted by M. For i < j,
denote by [i, j] the set {i, ..., j}. Let X1 , ..., Xm , m ≥ 2, be
rvs taking values in ﬁnite sets X1 , ..., Xm , respectively, and
with a known probability mass function. Denote by XM the
n
n
n
collection of rvs (X1 , ..., Xm ), and by XM = (X1 , ..., Xm )
the n independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). repetitions
of rvs XM . For a subset A of M, denote by XA the rvs
(Xi , i ∈ A). Given Ri ≥ 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, let RA denote the
sum i∈A Ri .
Finally, for 0 ≤ < 1, we say an rv U is -recoverable
from an rv V if there exists a function g of V such that
Pr (U = g(V )) ≥ 1 − .

(1)

and g0 is securely computable if
H (XM |G0 ) > R∗ ,

(2)

where R∗ has the operational signiﬁcance of being the minimum overall rate of communication needed for a speciﬁc
multiterminal source-coding task; this task does not involve
any security constraint.

II. P ROBLEM FORMULATION
We consider a multiterminal source model for function
computation using public communication, under privacy constraints. This basic model was introduced in [4] in a separate
context of SK generation with public transaction. Terminals
n
n
1, . . . , m observe, respectively, the sequences X1 , . . . , Xm of
length n. For 0 ≤ i ≤ m, let gi : XM → Yi be given
mappings, where the sets Yi are ﬁnite. Further, for 0 ≤ i ≤ m
n
n

and n ≥ 1, the (single-letter) mapping gi : XM → Yi is

It was shown in [10] that (1) and (2) constitute, respectively,
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the functions above to
be securely computable, with R∗ being the minimum rate of
interactive communication F that enables all the terminals
in M to attain omniscience (see [4]), i.e., recover all the
n

given to the terminals in M \ A. In fact, it was shown that
n
when condition (2) holds, it is possible to recover XM using
communication that is independent of Gn .

The last class of problems we study is a generalization of
the previous instance of secure multiterminal source coding.
Speciﬁcally, we consider the situation where each terminal
n
wishes to recover some subset XMi of the sources where
Mi ⊆ M \ {i}, i.e.,

Deﬁnition 2. For n > 0, n ≥ 1, we say that functions2
gM = (g0 , g1 , ..., gm ), with private function g0 , are n securely computable ( n - SC) from observations of length n,

our achievability schemes for secure computing attain “strong
secrecy” in the sense of [8], [2], [4]. In fact, when we have a
single-letter form, our proof can be modiﬁed to yield “strong
secrecy.”

While a characterization of securely computable functions
in the general sense of Deﬁnition 3 is unresolved, for the
speciﬁc classes above we provide matching necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions for the secure computability of gM . The
guiding heuristic in this work is the following generalized
interpretation of the results of [10]: Conditions (1) and (2)
constitute, respectively, the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions
for functions gM = (g0 , g1 , ..., gm ) to be securely computable,
where R∗ is the inﬁmum of the rates of interactive communication F in a multiterminal source coding problem described
below:
For each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, the following must hold simultaneously:
n
(P1) Gn is n -recoverable from (Xi , F ), and
i
n
n
(P2) XM is n -recoverable from (Xi , Gn , F ), i.e., the ter0
minals attain omniscience, with Gn as side information
0
that is used only for decoding (but is not used for the
communication F ),

By deﬁnition, for n -SC functions gM , the private function
G0 is effectively concealed from an eavesdropper with access
to the public communication F.
Deﬁnition 3. For private function g0 , we say that functions
gM are securely computable if gM are n - SC from observations of length n and public communication F = F(n) , such
that lim n = 0.

Figure 1 shows the setup for secure computing.
In this paper, we give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions
for the secure computability of certain classes of functions
gM = (g0 , g1 , ..., gm ). There are three classes of problems
studied. In the ﬁrst two classes, we require at least one of the

terminals to compute the private function g0 , i.e. gi = g0 for
some 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The subclass with the additional restriction
gi = gi (g0 ) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m (along with gi = g0 for some i)
allows for a more structured secure computing protocol, and is
studied ﬁrst. We note that the formulation in [10], in which the
terminals in a given subset A of M are required to compute
(only) g0 securely, is a further particularization with

above has a single-letter formula. In general, a single-letter
expression for R∗ is not known.
Our results, described in section III, are obtained by simple
adaptations of this principle. Unlike [10], our conditions, in
general, are not of a single-letter form. Nevertheless, they
provide a structural characterization of secure computability.
As an application, our results provide simple conditions for
secure computability in the following illustrative example.

Note that the SK-based scheme for secure computing given
in section IV relies critically on the functional relation gi =

other hand, Ri (gM ) is an appropriate rate of communication
for the computation of gM ; we show that latter being less than
H (XM |G0 ) guarantees the secure computability of gM .
Although the conditions for secure computability above are
not of a single-letter form in general, they do reduce to such
a form for speciﬁc instances. The following result provides a
sufﬁcient condition for obtaining single-letter conditions for
characterizing securely computable functions.

The quantity inf n,F RF corresponds to the solution of a
multiterminal source coding problem, and is the inﬁmum of
the rates of interactive communication F that satisfy (P1) and
(P2) above, and additionally satisﬁes:
n
(P3) XM is

n -recoverable

This modiﬁcation corresponds to the introduction of m − m0
dummy terminals, with the jth dummy terminal observing Gn ,
j
m0 < j ≤ m; the dummy terminals can be realized by a
n
n
terminal i in [1, ..., m0 ] that recovers XM from (Xi , F). As
remarked before, the SK-based secure computing scheme in
section IV does not work for this case, and a secure computing
scheme based on the dummy terminals above is used instead.
The conditions (P2) and (P3) above correspond to omniscience
at the terminals in the extended model, with Gn provided as
0
side information only for decoding.

then Ri (gM ) =

The proof is a simple consequence of the deﬁnition of

Ri (gM ) in (11). Note that Rconstant has a single-letter form.

Remark. As mentioned before, the quantity inf n,F RF is the
inﬁmum of the rates of interactive communication that satisﬁes
(P1),(P2) for i = 1, 3, and satisﬁes (P1)-(P3) for i = 2. Thus,
when the conditions of Lemma 2 hold, we have from Theorem
1 that gM are securely computable if

i = 2.
As a consequence of Lemma 2, we obtain below a singleletter characterization of securely computable functions, with
m = 2, in a special case; the following lemma, which is a
special case of [5, Lemma B.1] (see also [6, Theorem 1]), is
instrumental to our proof.

As before, the quantity inf n,F RF corresponds to the inﬁmum

Our main result below characterizes securely computable

Lemma 3. Let m = 2. For an interactive communication F,
we have

n
H(F) ≥ H (F|X1 ) + H (F|X2 ) .
We next consider case (1) for two terminals.

Theorem 1. For i = 1, 2, 3, with functions g0 , g1 , ..., gm as in
the case (i) above, the functions gM are securely computable
if the following condition holds:

Corollary 4. For m = 2, for functions g0 , g1 , g2 with g1 = g0

Conversely, if the functions above are securely computable,

using the approach of the proof of sufﬁciency in [10, Theorem

the existence of rvs Kj = Kj Xj of approximate rate

where the last inequality follows from Lemma 3. The result
then follows from Lemma 2.
We next derive simple conditions for secure computability
for the BSS in Example 1
Example 2. Consider the setup of Example 1, with g0 =
g1 = X1 ⊕ X2 , X1 .X2 and g2 = X1 .X2 . By Corollary 4
∗
and the observation H (G2 |X2 ) = h(δ)/2, we get R1 (gM ) =
3h(δ)/2. Since H (X1 , X2 | G0 ) = H (X1 , X2 | X1 ⊕ X2 ) −
H (X1 .X2 | X1 ⊕ X2 ) = δ, the characterization of secure
computability claimed in Example 1 follows from Theorem
1.
Example 3. In the setup of Example 1, consider g0 = g1 =
X1 ⊕ X2 and g2 = X1 .X2 . This choice of g0 , g1 , g2 is an instance of case (2) above. For an interactive communication F,
a manipulation of constraints (2a), (2b), (2c) in the deﬁnition

IV. O UTLINE OF PROOF OF T HEOREM 1
In this section we present the key ideas in the proof of
sufﬁciency part of Theorem 1 for case (1). The sufﬁciency
proof for other cases, and the proof of necessity, are omitted
due to space constraints.

If H (XM |G0 ) > R1 (gM ) holds, then from the deﬁnition
