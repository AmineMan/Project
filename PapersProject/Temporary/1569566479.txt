for MISO broadcast channels in [6], where it enabled a boost
of DoF strictly beyond that when no CSIT is available. For
MIMO interference channels with delayed CSIT [7] [8] [9],
and the 2 × 2 × 2 network [9] [10], a strict improvement over
the case without CSIT was also demonstrated.
However, in a network with arbitrary number of nodes
and connectivity, how to make use of delayed transmitter
CSI and what is the best-achievable DoF is unsettled even
for two unicast Gaussian networks. In this paper, we make
some progress, by answering the following question: in layered
two unicast Gaussian networks, what is the necessary and
sufﬁcient condition when one can make use of delayed CSIT to
increase the DoF region strictly beyond the time-sharing DoF
region? It turns out that the answer coincides with that under
instantaneous CSIT [5], and the condition is that there is no
omniscient node [4] in the network1 . Moreover, as in the case
under instantaneous CSIT [5], once beyond 1/2 DoF per user
(the time-sharing DoF) is achievable, so is 2/3 DoF per user.
However, when there is no omniscient node in the network,
unlike the case under instantaneous CSIT where either (1/2, 1)
or (1, 1/2) DoF pair is achievable, there are examples where
neither can be achieved while (2/3, 2/3) is achievable (e.g.,
the 2 × 2 × 2 network, the DoF region of which is completely
characterized in [9] [10]).
The converse part of the result follows straightforwardly
from that in the case with instantaneous CSIT: if there is
an omniscient node in the network, even with instantaneous
CSIT, sum DoF of greater than 1 is not achievable. Our main
contribution lies in the achievability proof when there is no
omniscient node, where we extend the scheme proposed in
[6] [10] to exploit delayed CSIT in two unicast networks with
arbitrary number of nodes and connectivity. Unlike in speciﬁc
networks such as the two-user interference channel or the
2 × 2 × 2 network, the key idea in dealing with networks with
general connectivity is to identify the special nodes that have
to make carefully designed (linear) operations; these nodes
are identiﬁed in a systematical way. To achieve 2/3 DoF per
user, most nodes in the network can just perform oblivious
random linear coding that does not require CSI, except for
these special nodes which do the carefully designed linear
operations to exploit delayed CSI.

Abstract—In this paper we study the two unicast information
ﬂow problem over layered Gaussian networks with arbitrary
number of nodes and connectivity, under the model of delayed
channel state information (CSI) at transmitters and instantaneous CSI at receivers. We show that similar to the case with
instantaneous CSI at transmitters (CSIT), the degrees of freedom
(DoF) region is strictly larger than the time-sharing DoF region
if and only if there is no omniscient node, deﬁnition of which
only depends on the topology of the network. Moreover, as in
the case with instantaneous CSIT, 2/3 DoF per user is always
achievable when there is no omniscient node in the network.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Characterizing the capacity region of multiple unicast sessions over multi-source-multi-destination networks (namely,
multiple unicast networks) has been a long-standing open
question in network information theory. For a Gaussian network with arbitrary number of nodes and connectivity, except
for the single unicast/multicast problem where the approximate
capacity is characterized [1], very little is known.
When there are multiple information ﬂows in the network,
they cause (message) interference to one another, and in
general this will reduce the number of degrees of freedom
(DoF) available for each user. Recently it has been shown
that one can make use of the intermediate nodes to facilitate
interference neutralization [2] [3] [4] [5], thereby reducing
the effect of message interference. In particular, [5] fully
characterized the DoF region of layered two unicast Gaussian
networks with constant channel gains. In some situations, full
DoF can be achieved for each user.
Interference neutralization opens various interesting possibilities for managing interference in multiple unicast networks.
However it requires instantaneous channel state information
at transmitters (CSIT) to work. In practice, channel gains are
measured at receivers and then fed back to the transmitters
with certain delay. In situations when the delay is larger
than the channel coherence time, the channel state could
have changed. In such cases, the transmitters can only have
strictly causal knowledge about the channel states. Under such
constraints, interference neutralization is no longer feasible,
and a natural question is whether such delayed CSIT can be
helpful. The value of such delayed CSIT was demonstrated

both s1 and s2 . For each node v ∈ V \ {s1 , s2 }, for i = 1, 2,

The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
the model of the network and the channel state information.
Section III summarizes a few deﬁnitions and the main theorem.
In Section IV, we demonstrate several key ideas through a
motivating example. Then Section V is devoted to prove the
achievability. Finally we conclude the paper with Section VI.
II. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
A two-source-two-destination layered network G = (V, E)
is a collection of nodes V that can be partitioned into L + 2
layers (L ≥ 0):
V=

L+1
k=0

Lk , Lk ∩ Lj = ∅, ∀k = j,

such that for any edge (u, v) ∈ E, ∃ k, 0 ≤ k ≤ L s.t. u ∈
Lk , v ∈ Lk+1 . The ﬁrst layer L0 = {s1 , s2 } consists of the
two source nodes, and the last layer LL+1 = {d1 , d2 } consists
of the two destination nodes. Without loss of generality we
assume each node in the network can be reached by at least
one of the source nodes and can reach at least one of the
destination nodes. For each node v ∈ V \ {s1 , s2 }, we deﬁne
nodes that can reach v as its predecessors. Let P(v) denote
the set of predecessors that can reach v in one step. We will
call the nodes in P(v) as the parents of v.
For each edge (u, v) ∈ E, the associated channel gain at
time t is given by hvu [t] ∈ R, t ≥ 0, where the channel
gains are i.i.d. drawn from a continuous distribution, over
time and E. Let Xu [t], Yu [t] ∈ R denote the transmission and
reception of node u respectively. The reception of a node is
the superposition of the transmission of its parents along with
an additive white Gaussian noise:
Yv [t] =

u∈P(v)

{v},
if |P si (v)| = 1
si
si
{v} ∪ {u : P (u) = P (v)} , if |P si (v)| = 1
(1)
Note that only accounting the contribution from source si , the
reception of v and a node in u ∈ Ksi (v) are just a scaled
version of each other, i.e., they are si -clones.
Deﬁnition 4 (Omniscient Node): We say a node v ∈ V is
omniscient if it satisﬁes either of (A) or (B) below:
(A) The removal of {v} separates d1 from {s1 , s2 } and the
removal of Ks2 (v) separates d2 from s2 .
(B) The same as above with indice 1 and 2 exchanged.

hvu [t]Xu [t] + Zu [t],

where the noise Zu [t] ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) is i.i.d. over time and V.
Each node has the same power constraint P .
At time t ≥ 1, a node w ∈ V has knowledge of the channel
coefﬁcient associated to edge (u, v) ∈ E, hvu up to time (t−l),
if the tail node of this edge, v, can reach w in l steps in the
undirected version of G. Note under this CSI model, it remains
that a receiver have instantaneous CSI associated to the edges
connecting to it, while a transmitter only have unit-delayed
CSI associated to the edges emanating from it. For example,
in the network depicted in Fig. 1(a), at time t regarding the
channel gain associated to the edge (u2 , u4 ), the source s1 has
its CSI up to time (t − 2), simply because the tail node u4 can
reach s1 in two steps on the undirected version of G.
We are mainly interested in the high-SNR approximate
capacity region, namely, the collection of achievable degrees
of freedom (DoF). For user i, i = 1, 2, its achievable DoF is
Ri
deﬁned as di := limP →∞ 1 log(1+P/σ2 ) , where (R1 , R2 ) lies
2
in the capacity region of the two unicast network.

A Network with Sum DoF = 1

To illustrate the above deﬁnitions, let us consider the
network illustrated in Fig. 1(a) which consists of ﬁve layers:
L0 , L1 , . . . , L4 . The second layer L1 consists of three nodes
{u1 , u2 , u3 }. u1 is s1 -only-reachable, u2 is s2 -only-reachable,
while u3 is s1 s2 -reachable. It is straightforward to see that the
removal of u3 separates d2 from {s1 , s2 } and it is the earliest
(in terms of layer indices), i.e., u3 is the critical node for user 2.

III. R ESULT
To present our main result, we begin with a few deﬁnitions,
followed by an example network illustrating the deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 1 (Critical Nodes): For each i = 1, 2, we deﬁne
∗
the critical node vi as any node with the smallest layer index

2

Similarly, the node u4 is the critical node for user 1. The cloud
C1 = {u6 , u7 }, the reception of which is (roughly) determined
by the critical node u3 . Similarly the cloud C2 = {u5 , u8 , u9 }.
The nodes u1 and u3 share the same s1 -reachable parent
which is s1 . Hence, we see that from (1) the s1 -clone of
u3 : Ks1 (u3 ) = {u1 , u3 }. Now from Fig. 1(b), we see that
the removal of Ks1 (u3 ) separates d1 from s1 . Hence, u3 is
omniscient since it satisﬁes Condition (B) of Deﬁnition 4.
Next we shall argue intuitively that for any working system
on this network, u3 can decode both users’ messages, implying
that the sum DoF is at most 1. To see this, we argue ﬁrst
by ignoring the noise. In a working system, since u3 is a
critical node for user 2, it can decode user 2’s message; hence
transmission from s2 . Since the received signal of u3 is the
sum of the transmitted signals from s1 and s2 , it therefore
knows the transmission from s1 and the the reception of u1 .
Therefore in any working system, d2 -critical node u3 knows
the transmission from source s2 and Ks1 (u3 ) = {u1 , u3 }.
Finally, the reception of d1 is determined by the transmissions
from Ks1 (u3 ) and s2 , and hence in a working system, u3 can
decode user 1’s message as well.
The following theorem summarizes the main result.
Theorem 1: Under delayed CSIT model, if there is no
omniscient node in the network, then the DoF region contains
the kite region

The case k1 = 0 and k2 ≥ 2.

∗
∗
First, s1 can reach the critical node v2 since k2 = 0. Second,
∗ , the layer that user 2’s critical node
note that in layer Lk2
∗
belongs to, only the critical node v2 can reach d2 due to its
∗
deﬁnition. Therefore other nodes in Lk2 belong to cloud C1 .
∗
Beside, since v2 is not omniscient but its removal will separate
∗
d2 from {s1 , s2 }, the removal of its s1 -clones, Ks1 (v2 ), cannot
∗
separate d1 from s1 . Therefore, there exists a node w ∈ Lk2
that can reach d1 , such that
∗
i) P s1 (v2 ) = P s1 (w), or
∗
∗
s1
ii) P (v2 ) = P s1 (w) and |P s1 (v2 ) | ≥ 2.
Now, if instantaneous CSIT is available, the parents of w and
∗
v2 can choose their transmission according to the channel
gains that they are faced with so that interference is com∗
pletely cancelled “over-the-air” at w and v2 [5]. Without the
knowledge of these channel coefﬁcients beforehand, however,
such cancellation seems impossible.
Under delayed CSIT, we shall prove that (d1 , d2 ) = (1, 1/2)
is always achievable. Our scheme is linear in the sense that
every node transmits a linear transformation of its reception.
Since the performance measure of interest is DoF, in the rest of
the paper we neglect the additive noise terms and focus on the
linear combinations that nodes receive and transmit. The goal
is to deliver a block (length 2) of two symbols {a1 , a2 } from
s1 to d1 and a block of one symbol {b} from s2 to d2 over two
time slots. Our scheme breaks the layered network into several
stages, each of which consists of several consecutive layers.
When we describe the scheme in the following, we focus on
how transmitted signals in each stage are formed according to
the reception from the previous stage. Moreover, some special
nodes that exploit delayed transmitter CSI have to wait until
the relevant CSI is gathered. Therefore, the time index t in
the following does not refer to “absolute time” but the “order
index” of the transmitted signal associated to each block of
symbols. Different blocks will be pipelined in a standard way.
Let us describe the scheme for the stage from Layer L0 to
∗
∗
∗
L(k2 −1) and the stage from L(k2 −1) to Lk2 , and show that
DoF (d1 , d2 ) = (1, 1/2) is achievable.

K := {(d1 , d2 ) : d1 ≥ 0, d2 ≥ 0, 2d1 + d2 ≤ 2, d1 + 2d2 ≤ 2}
and in particular, (d1 , d2 ) = (2/3, 2/3) is achievable.
Conversely, if there is an omniscient node in the network,
then the DoF region is the triangular region
T := {d1 ≥ 0, d2 ≥ 0, d1 + d2 ≤ 1} .
Remark: There is an example (the 2 × 2 × 2 interference
network) where the DoF region is exactly the kite K.
The converse part of Theorem 1 follows from the instantaneous CSIT result and hence is omitted here. It can be found
in the appendix of the extended version of this paper [11]. In
the rest of the paper we focus on the proof of the direct part.
IV. A M OTIVATING E XAMPLE FOR ACHIEVABILITY
Before we go into details of the proof, in this section
we ﬁrst present some key intuitions behind the achievability
proof via a special case where one of the two users does not
experience interference. We illustrate how to identify and code
at special nodes of the network. One such special nodes are the
critical nodes (see Deﬁnition 1) which (roughly) determine the
reception of their respective destinations, i.e., should be able
to decode the desired messages. Moreover, the critical nodes
naturally break the overall networks into several effective
stages, which play a key role in the scheme.
Consider the special networks where d1 can only be reached
by s1 and hence only user 2 is interfered. The critical node for
user 1 is s1 . The assumption of the non-existence of omniscient
node then implies that the critical node for user 2 must lie in
a layer with index strictly larger than 1. Therefore we have
∗
∗
k1 = 0, k2 ≥ 2 (see Deﬁnition 1) as illustrated in Fig. 2.

∗
Phase 1: Stage L0 to L(k2 −1) , Time t = 1, 2: At each
of the two time slots, each node in this stage (excluding
∗
L(k2 −1) ) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation
of its reception at that time slot, with s1 sending {a1 , a2 } and
s2 sending {b, b} at time t = 1 and t = 2 respectively.
∗
∗
Phase 2: Stage L(k2 −1) to Lk2 , Time t = 1: Each node in
∗
layer L(k2 −1) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation of its receptions over time slots t = 1 and t = 2. A node

3

∗
cannot reach v2 . Therefore, its received linear combination
of {a1 , a2 } at time t = 2 is not aligned to Aw with high
probability, as A2 is not. Combining this linear combination
with its received signal at time t = 1, Aw , it can decode
{a1 , a2 }. Hence, d1 can receive {a1 , a2 } from w.
Let us summarize the key elements that we develop throughout this motivating example:
• Critical nodes serve as “anchors” in the scheme. The two
sources2 , parents of critical nodes, and critical nodes are
the places where delayed transmitter CSI is exploited.
• Other nodes in the network simply perform random linear
coding in any phases of the scheme.
• Absence of omniscient nodes guarantees the richness of
received linear combinations and is the key to the proof.

For i = 1, 2 and any node u ∈ V, gusi [t] denote the end-to-end
effective channel coefﬁcient from source si to node u at time
t, taking the linear transformations at intermediate nodes into
account. β u [1] denote the linear transformation at time t = 1.
∗
∗
Let us denote the received linear combination at v2 , Yv2 [1],
a1
∗
by A2 + B2 , where A2 = GT2 s1
and B2 = gv2 s2 b. Note
v∗
a2
∗
∗
that gv2 s2 = 0 with high probability since s2 can reach v2 .
Key Observation:
∗
∗
Since v2 is not omniscient, in layer Lk2 there exists a node
w ∈ C1 such that in its received signal Yw [1] = Aw =
a
∗
GT 1 1 , the column vector Gws1 is not aligned to Gv2 s1
ws
a2
with high probability. This is because either
∗
i) P s1 (v2 ) = P s1 (w), or
∗
∗
s1
ii) P (v2 ) = P s1 (w) and |P s1 (v2 ) | ≥ 2.
In both cases, due to the independent random mixing at the
parent nodes as well as the i.i.d. fading channel gains, the
above claim follows straightforwardly as in the case with
instantaneous CSIT [4] [5].

V. P ROOF OF ACHIEVABILITY
∗
∗
Without loss of generality, let us assume that k1 ≤ k2 ,
that is, the critical node for user 1 lies in a layer with index
∗
smaller than that for user 2. Note that if ki = 1, then the
∗
critical node vi becomes omniscient, violating the assumption.
∗
Hence in the following we consider the case ki = 1, for
∗
i = 1, 2. Moreover, if k1 = 0, it means that d1 is s1 -only∗
reachable. If k2 = 0 too, then d2 is also s2 -only-reachable,
and the two users do not interfere with each other. Hence
DoF (d1 , d2 ) = (1, 1) is achievable without CSIT by routing.
Also, in Section IV we have already shown that (1, 1/2) is
∗
∗
achievable when k1 = 0 and k2 ≥ 2. Hence, (2/3, 2/3) can
be achieved by time-sharing between (1, 1/2) and (0, 1).
∗
∗
What remains to be dealt with is the case 2 ≤ k1 ≤ k2 . Our
∗
scheme ensures that vi can decode what di aims to decode,
i = 1, 2. We focus on linear schemes. The goal is to deliver a
block of two symbols {a1 , a2 } from s1 to d1 and a block of
two symbols {b1 , b2 } from s2 to d2 over three time slots. Our
scheme breaks the layered network into several stages, each
of which consists of several consecutive layers.
First we need to make sure that symbols {a1 , a2 } can be
∗
retrieved by the critical node v1 , which can be reached by both
sources. Let us begin by describing the scheme for the stage
∗
∗
∗
from Layer L0 to L(k1 −1) and the stage from L(k1 −1) to Lk1 .

∗
∗
Phase 3: Stage L(k2 −1) to Lk2 , Time t = 2: Each s2 ∗
only-reachable node in layer L(k2 −1) transmits a randomly
∗
chosen scaled copy of b. Each s1 -reachable node in L(k2 −1)
∗
that cannot reach v2 transmits a randomly chosen linear
transformation of its receptions over time slots t = 1 and
t = 2, as in Phase 2.
∗
On the other hand, the s1 -reachable parents of v2 are those
have to take care in forming their transmit linear combinations.
Each of them, say, u, will combine its received linear combinations over the time slots t = 1, 2 so that in the combination,
the contribution from source s1 is equal to A2 . Mathematically,
a
(1)
(2)
if A2 = GT2 s1 1 = gv∗ s1 a1 + gv∗ s1 a2 , then u will combine
v∗
2
2
a2
Yu [1] = gus1 [1]a1 + gus2 [1]b and Yu [2] = gus1 [2]a2 + gus2 [2]b
in the following way:

Xu [2] =

(1)
gv∗ s1
2

(Yu [1]/gus1 [1]) +

(2)
gv∗ s1
2

∗
Phase 1: Stage L0 to L(k1 −1) , Time t = 1, 2: At each
of the two time slots, each node in this stage (excluding
∗
L(k1 −1) ) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformation
of its reception at that time slot, with s1 sending {a1 , a2 } and
s2 sending {b1 , b2 } at time t = 1 and t = 2 respectively.

(Yu [2]/gus1 [2])

This operation is feasible under the CSI model, since the
(1)
(2)
effective channel gains gv∗ s1 and gv∗ s1 (which determine the
2
2
linear combination A2 ) only contain past channel coefﬁcients,
∗
and this knowledge is known to the s1 -reachable parents of v2
at this point.
∗
The received signal of v2 at time t = 2 becomes a linear
combination of A2 and b, and due to the i.i.d. fading channel
gains, this linear combination is not aligned to A2 + B2 with
∗
high probability. Hence v2 can decode b. Then within the cloud
∗
C2 , v2 can deliver b to d2 by routing.
As for destination d1 , it relies on the node w to deliver the
two symbols {a1 , a2 }. Note that w at time t = 2 receives a
scaled version of A2 plus some other randomly formed linear
combination of {a1 , a2 } if w has an s1 -reachable parent that

∗
∗
Phase 2: Stage L(k1 −1) to Lk1 , Time t = 1: Each node in
∗ −1) transmits a randomly chosen linear transformalayer L(k1
tion of its receptions over time slots t = 1 and t = 2.
∗
∗
Let us denote the received linear combination at v1 , Yv1 [1],
a1
b
by A1 + B1 , where A1 = GT1 s1
and B1 = GT1 s2 1 .

transmitter CSI. However, as shown in Section V, it is required in general.

b1
∗
, the column vector Gvs2 is not aligned to Gv1 s2
b2
with high probability.

∗
∗
In this case all nodes in Lk1 keep silent except v1 and v.
Note that the node v can decode B1 . The important thing is,
B1 and Bv (the contribution from s2 at time t = 1) are not
∗
aligned. We shall make use of v1 as the source of providing
{a1 , a2 } and v as the source of providing {b1 , b2 }. During the

ﬁrst time slot, we shut user 1 off, that is, keep v1 silent, and
let v deliver B1 to d2 by routing. During the second and the
third time slots, we mimic the (1, 1/2)-achievability scheme
∗
∗
in the case k1 = 0, k2 ≥ 2 in Section IV to deliver symbols
∗
{a1 , a2 } to d1 and Bv to d2 . v1 takes the role of s1 , and v takes
the role of s2 . The only difference is that, v may not be able
to decode {b1 , b2 }. As an alternative, during Phase 1 of the
scheme (described in Section IV) it sends out Av + Bv . Note
that now in Phase 2, the linear combination A2 will contain
the contribution from Av , but it is still a linear combination
of {a1 , a2 }. The rest of the scheme remains the same, and at
the end of the three phases, d2 can decode Bv . In summary,
at the end of the three time slots, d1 obtains {a1 , a2 } and d2
obtains {B1 , Bv } and hence {b1 , b2 }.

Phase 3: Stage L0 to L(k1 −1) , Time t = 3: Each node in
∗
this stage (excluding L(k1 −1) ) transmits a randomly chosen
linear transformation of its reception at time slot t = 3, with
s1 sending some linear combination of {a1 , a2 }, A (which is
not aligned to A1 ), and s2 sending B1 respectively.

Phase 4: Stage L(k1 −1) to Lk1 , Time t = 2, 3: At each of
∗
the two time slots, each node in layer L(k1 −1) transmits a
randomly chosen linear transformation of its reception at time
∗
slot t = 3. The received signals of v1 at time t = 2 and t = 3
are

The two linear combinations of {A, B1 } are linearly inde∗
pendent with high probability. Hence v1 can decode {A, B1 }.

Combined with Yv1 [1] = A1 + B1 , v1 can decode A1 and
hence {a1 , a2 }.

So far we have designed the scheme so that v1 is able to
decode {a1 , a2 } over three time slots. Next, the scheme in the
later stages has to guarantee that

i) Symbols {a1 , a2 } can be delivered to d1 from v1 , and
∗
ii) v2 can decode {b1 , b2 }

Though absence of an omniscient node enables performance
better than time-sharing, we still do not have a conclusive
DoF characterization of arbitrary two-unicast networks with
delayed CSIT. This is part of an ongoing study, where we are
exploring better outer bounds as well as new coding ideas.

In this case, the two critical nodes
and
are in the
same layer Lk∗ . Due to the deﬁnition of critical nodes, we
∗ ∗
can conclude that Lk∗ = {v1 , v2 }, that is, only these two
nodes are in layer Lk∗ .
Therefore, the node v described in the above scheme must
∗
∗
be v2 . Denote the received signal at time t = 1, Yv2 [1], by
a1

A2 + B2 , where A2 = GT2 s1

Since v1 is not omniscient, the two column vectors Gv1 s2

since v2 is not omniscient, the two column vectors Gv1 s1 and

We choose the transmitted linear combination of s1 at time

{a1 , a2 }, v2 can decode {b1 , b2 }, by ﬁrst decoding {A2 , B1 }

and then combining with Yv2 [1] = A2 + B2 to obtain B2 .

In layer Lk1 , v1 is able to decode {a1 , a2 , B1 } due to the
∗
∗
chosen scheme. If v1 cannot reach v2 , then inside the cloud C1 ,
we can deliver {a1 , a2 } to d1 without affecting the reception
∗
∗
∗
of v2 . If v1 can reach v2 , then the operation has to be more
careful. Hence, we shall distinguish further into two cases: a)
∗
∗
∗
∗
v1 can reach v2 , and b) v1 cannot reach v2 . In the latter case, a
more detailed discussion is required. Due to space constraint,
we leave it in the extended version of this paper [11]. Below
∗
∗
we focus on the case when v1 can reach v2 .
