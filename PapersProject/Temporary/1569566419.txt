convexity properties of the SER of such constellations are
relatively scarce in the literature, even though they could prove
to be useful in system optimization. It is known that the second
derivative of the SER of a constellation of dimensionality
greater than two is non-negative at sufﬁciently high SNR [2].
Although this result is a general one, it does not provide a
conclusive means of determining whether a given arbitrary
constellation has a convex SER or not. For certain higher
dimensional constellations, analytical expressions for the SER
have been derived in the literature, which can be used to
deduce the convexity of the SER. For example, the class of
constellations of dimensionality 2, 3, 4 and 5 described in [7]
can be veriﬁed to have convex SERs under AWGN. On the
other hand, verifying if a SER is completely monotone is
difﬁcult, even if a closed form expression for the SER is
available. In addition, there has been no investigation into
the complete monotonicity properties of the SER for higher
dimensional constellations, which can be used to simplify the
expressions for average SERs in fading channels, as well as
to establish useful comparisons of average SERs of a system
under two different fading channels [3], using the tools of
stochastic ordering, introduced in [3], [8].
In this work, it is shown that the SER of an arbitrary
multi-dimensional constellation impaired by additive independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Gaussian noise under
maximum likelihood detection is completely monotone in the
average SNR if the constellation matrix (i.e. the matrix with
column vectors as the constellation points) has a rank of one
or two. This includes all constellation of dimensionality one
and two, and also many constellations of higher dimensions.
The result on the complete monotonicity of SER is shown
generalize to the case where the noise follows a dependent
compound Gaussian distribution, which includes a number
of non-Gaussian models such as Cauchy, Middleton classA and symmetric alpha-stable distributions. Since complete
monotonicity implies convexity, it is seen that the SER is a
convex function of the SNR regardless of the constellation
dimensionality, provided that the constellation matrix has a
rank of one or two. The complete monotonicity of SER can be
used to compare the average SER over pairs of fading channels
at all values of average SNR, even for such cases where
the exact expression for the average error rate is intractable.
Therefore, the contributions of this work are threefold: (i)

Abstract—In this paper, it is shown that the symbol error
rate of an arbitrary multi-dimensional constellation impaired
by independent and identically distributed additive white Gaussian noise under maximum likelihood detection is completely
monotonic in the average SNR, if the rank of the constellation
matrix is either one or two. Further, under minimum distance
detection, this result generalizes to the case when the noise follows
a dependent and identically distributed compound Gaussian
distribution. Classes of constellations with dimensionality greater
than two, which have completely monotone and convex error
rates are also identiﬁed herein. The applications of the complete
monotonicity of the symbol error rate in obtaining generic
comparisons of average error rates over pairs of fading channels
are also discussed.

I. I NTRODUCTION
An important performance metric in digital communications
is the symbol error rate (SER). Its convexity in the signal to
noise ratio (SNR) plays a critical role in various optimization
problems [1]. When convex, the error rate has a negative ﬁrst
derivative and a positive second derivative. Additionally, if
all the successive derivatives of the SER alternate in sign
(referred to as complete monotonicity), then it is possible
to express error rates as a positive mixture of decaying
exponentials, which has applications in obtaining comparisons
of average error rates over fading channels. This motivates us
to explore the complete monotonicity properties of the SER of
arbitrary multi-dimensional constellations, which are stronger
than the corresponding convexity results in [2]. We now give
an overview of the literature addressing such properties of the
SER.
One-dimensional and two-dimensional constellations have
been adopted in many communication systems in the literature,
and investigations into the properties of the SER of these
constellations have revealed the conditions on the convexity of
the SER with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under
impairing additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) [2]. Some
special cases of two dimensional constellations such as M -ary
phase shift keying (M -PSK) and M -ary quadrature amplitude
modulation (M -QAM) have SERs which are known to be
completely monotonic functions of the SNR [3], [4], which is a
stronger condition than convexity. On the other hand, constellations of dimensionality greater than two (which we refer to
as “higher dimensional constellations” henceforth) have found
practical applications in satellite communications [5] and more
recently, in optical communications [6]. Investigations of the

the notion of complete monotonicity of SERs is investigated;
(ii) the concept of the reduced dimension of a constellation
is proposed as a relevant quantity that affects convexity and
complete monotonicity; (iii) stochastic ordering is proposed as
an alternative application to complement existing optimization
related applications of these results.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
II surveys some of the relevant mathematical background.
In Section III, we describe the system model considered in
this paper. The main results of this work on the complete
monotonicity of error rates are in Section IV. The applications
of complete monotonicity of error rates in ordering the average
error rates over two different fading channels is presented in
Section V. For the ease of readability, the proofs have been
delegated to the appendices.
Throughout this paper, sets are denoted using calligraphic
font, vectors are denoted using boldface lower-case notation,
and matrices are denoted using the boldface upper-case notation. E [f (X)] is used to denote the expectation of the
function f (·) over the distribution of the random variable X.
Pe,i (ρ) denotes the SER conditioned on the ith symbol of
the constellation being transmitted, Pe (ρ) denotes the SER
averaged over the entire constellation, ||·|| denotes the vector2 norm as well as the matrix-2 norm, and I[·] is the indicator
function, deﬁned as I[x ∈ S] = 1, if x ∈ S and 0 otherwise.

In this case, the decision region for any symbol si is a
polyhedron [10] denoted by Ωi , given by {x|Ai x ≤ bi }, i =
1 . . . , M . Further, the j th row of Ai is aT = (sj −
j,i
si )/ ||sj − si || and the j th element of bi : bj,i = ||sj − si || /2.
In what follows, the complete monotonicity properties of
the symbol error rate of an arbitrary N dimensional constellation are investigated. Before proceeding, the concept of an
equivalent constellation and reduced dimension is introduced,
which will be used in the results.
Deﬁnition : Let S := [s1 . . . sM ] ∈ RN ×M denote the
˜
constellation matrix whose rank is N ≤ N , and has a singular
˜
value decomposition S = UΣVT , where U ∈ RN ×N ,
˜ ˜
N ×N
˜ . We deﬁne the constellation
Σ ∈ R
and V ∈ M × N
˜
matrix S = ΣVT to be unitarily equivalent to S.
˜
The SER of S and S are identical for the minimum
˜
distance receiver under AWGN, since, S = UT S, is a unitary
transformation on S, which preserves the distances between
constellation points, and the energy of each constellation point.
Further, the noise statistics remain unchanged when multiplied
by a unitary matrix.

A function f : (0, ∞) → R is completely monotone (c.m.),
if it has derivatives of all orders, and satisﬁes

Now, the complete monotonicity properties of the symbol
error rate Pe (ρ) are discussed, which constitutes the main
theorem of the paper. Throughout, the aim of this paper is not
to obtain the exact performance analysis of multi-dimensional
constellations. Rather, its analytical properties are the main
focus.

Proof: See Appendix A. Appendix B has an alternate
proof.
Clearly, all constellations of dimensionality one and two
satisfy the conditions of Theorem 1. Thus, it is immediate
that some commonly used constellations such as the square
M -QAM and M -PSK have c.m. error rates, which is also
corroborated by [3], [4]. As a corollary of Theorem 1, it is
seen that all two dimensional constellations have convex SERs.
The convexity of error rates for two dimensional constellations
has been previously shown in [2]. A generalization of the
proof in [2] is provided in Appendix A. An alternate proof
of Theorem 1 is detailed in Appendix B, which relies on a
different approach.
In addition to one and two dimensional constellations,
Theorem 1 implies that any higher dimensional constellation
will have a c.m. and convex error rate provided it has a reduced

which is a Lebesgue integral with respect to a positive measure
µ on [0, ∞). It is straightforward to verify that c.m. functions
are positive and convex, and also that positive linear combinations of c.m. functions are also c.m.

where the transmitted symbol s ∈ RN is chosen from a set
S of M constellation points, with M ≥ N . The additive
noise is i.i.d Gaussian i.e. z := [z1 , . . . , zN ] can be written as
zi ∼ N (0, 1/ρ), where ρ is the average SNR. As mentioned,
ρ > 0 represents the average SNR, with the assumption that

dimension of one or two, which is seen to occur when the
constellation is unitarily equivalent to a constellation whose
points lie on a plane or a line. This is an important reﬁnement
to [2, Theorem 2].
Next, it is shown that Theorem 1 generalizes to the case
where the noise follows a dependent and identically distributed
compound Gaussian distribution, which has been used in the
wireless communications literature to model impulsive noise
[11]. The noise model is the following:
√
(5)
z = νg,

Now, consider the channel model
√
y = ρhs + z ,

where z := [z1 , z2 ] is the AWGN with unit variance, ρ > 0
represents the average SNR, h captures the effect of quasistatic fading and s is the transmitted symbol, chosen from a
˜
constellation matrix with reduced dimension N ≤ 2.
In order to compare the average symbol error rate of the
above system in two different fading environments, let the
instantaneous channel gain in the ﬁrst scenario is given by
X := |h|2 , while that in the second being Y := |h|2 . It
has been established in [3] that if X and Y represent the
instantaneous channel gains corresponding to Nakagami-m
fading with two different line of sight parameters mX ≤ mY ,
then X ≤Lt Y . The same is true for Rician fading with
parameters KX ≤ KY . Interpreting g(x) in (7) as the
instantaneous SER of a modulation scheme with c.m. SER,
through the deﬁnition of X ≤Lt Y , it is observed that if
the average error rate of differential phase shift keying is
consistently lesser in Y than in X ∀ρ, then so will be the
˜
average error rate of any constellation with N ≤ 2. In other
˜ ≤ 2, (7) implies that
words, for any constellation with N
E [Pe (ρY )] ≤ E [Pe (ρX)] ∀ρ > 0, whenever X ≤Lt Y . This
serves as a way of comparing the average error rates over two
fading channels, even in cases where the expression for the
average error rate is not analytically tractable.

where g := [g1 , . . . , gN ], with gj ∼ N (0, 1), j = 1, . . . , N
and ν is a positive random variable. The compound Gaussian
distribution includes a number of non-Gaussian noise models
based on the distribution of ν in (5). For example, when ν
is chosen as an afﬁne function of a Poisson random variable,
z follows the Middleton class-A distribution [12], and when
ν is chosen from a positive valued alpha-stable distribution,
z follows the symmetric alpha-stable distribution [13], which
includes Cauchy distributed noise as a special case.
Under this noise model, it is easy to verify that the SER of a
˜
constellation S and its unitarily equivalent constellation S will
be identical, since the distribution of UT z will be identical to
that of z. As a result, for any constellation of dimension N , we
˜
consider its unitarily equivalent constellation of dimension N .
Now, in order to extend Theorem 1 to the case of dependent
compound Gaussian noise, we restrict our attention to the
˜
case when N ≤ 2. Conditioning on ν in (5), the noise is
AWGN, and according to Theorem 1, for any constellation,
˜
Pe (ρ|ν) under minimum distance detection is c.m. if N ≤ 2.
Consequently, we see that Pe (ρ) = E [Pe (ρ|ν)] is c.m., which
can be veriﬁed by using the deﬁnition in (2). Although the
above extension of Theorem 1 applies to dependent compound
Gaussian noise, we note that it is possible to form a similar
extension to some special cases of i.i.d compound Gaussian
noise, using a minimum distance receiver. However, such a
generalization is beyond the scope of this paper.

VI. C ONCLUSIONS
In this paper, for the ﬁrst time in the literature, it is
established that the symbol error rate of any arbitrary multidimensional constellation which is unitarily equivalent to a
constellation whose points lie on a line or a plane is completely
monotonic in the average SNR parameter. This result is
stronger than the corresponding convexity results which have
been previously established. As an application of complete
monotonicity of symbol error rates, it is shown the stochastic
Laplace transform order can be systematically exploited in
order to obtain generic comparisons of the average symbol
error rate over a pair of parametric fading channels, even in
cases where the expressions for the same are intractable.

V. S TOCHASTIC O RDERING OF AVERAGE E RROR R ATES IN
FADING C HANNELS
Complete monotonicity of Pe (ρ) for arbitrary constella˜
tions with N ≤ 2 ﬁnds direct application in comparing the
average error rate of such constellations over two different
fading channels. Such generic comparisons are obtained using
the stochastic Laplace transform order, which is summarized
below. A detailed exposition of the theory of stochastic orders
can be found in [15].
For any two non-negative random variables X and Y , Y is
said to dominate X in the Laplace transform sense (denoted
by X ≤Lt Y ) if and only if
E [exp(−sY )] ≤ E [exp(−sX)] ∀ s ≥ 0 .

P ROOF OF T HEOREM 1
In this Appendix, we show that the proof for convexity of
the SER of arbitrary constellations in [2, Appendix] can be
generalized to establish its complete monotonicity.
For any given constellation S, we consider the its unitarily
˜
equivalent constellation S, since they have identical symbol
˜
error rates. Further, we restrict our proof to the case of N = 2,
˜
since constellations with N = 1 can be viewed as a special
˜
cases of constellations with N = 2.

One useful property of Laplace transform ordered random
variables is that for all c.m. functions g(·), we have

Let Pz (z; ρ) := (ρ/(2π)) exp(−(ρ/2)(z1 + z2 )) denote the
two dimensional Gaussian density function, and Pc,i (ρ) :=
1 − Pe,i (ρ) denote the probability of correct decision conditioned on the si being transmitted1 . The k th derivative of
Pc,i (ρ) for k = 1, 2, . . . is given by

Pz (z; ρ) dz ≤
dρk

when k is even, while the inequality in (16) is reversed when
k is odd. It is easy to see that the right hand side of (16) is
zero for both these cases, since the Gaussian PDF integrates to
unity, whose second k th differential equals zero. Thus, all even
order derivatives of Pc,i (ρ) are negative when ρ ≤ αk /d2
max,i ,
while all odd order derivatives are positive in this regime.

This SNR regime corresponds to {ρ|αk /d2
max,i ≤ ρ ≤

min,i
and (14) respectively. Deﬁne Ωcon as the region formed by
2
the intersection of the circle {z : ||z|| ≤ αk /ρ}, and the
Voronoi region Ωi . Clearly, Ωcon is the cone whose base
2
is the intersection of aT z = bj,i and ||z|| ≤ αk /ρ. Note
j,i
that Ωcon partitions the Voronoi region into two sub-regions:
Ωb := Ωi ∩ Ωcon and Ωa := Ωi − Ωb .
2
By deﬁnition, Ωb consists of {z : ||z|| ≤ αk /ρ}, which
2
together with (11) implies gk (||z|| ) ≤ 0. Thus, for z ∈ Ωb ,
(10) is negative for even k, and positive for odd k. Using this
in (9), we get

Since (10) depends on the value of ρ, we consider three different intervals for ρ, corresponding to high SNR, intermediate

each of these SNR regimes.

of (10) over Ωa for even k as follows:

is odd. Adding (17) and (21), we see that in the intermediate
SNR regime, (9) is negative, when k is even, and vice-versa,
when k is odd.
Combining the results from Cases (i), (ii) and (iii), we
conclude that the derivatives of Pc,i (ρ) alternate in sign, with
the ﬁrst derivative being positive. Consequently, Pe,i (ρ) is a
c.m. function. This implies Pe (ρ) := i Pr[s = si ]Pe,i (ρ)
is also a c.m. function, since c.m. functions are closed under
conic combinations.

following the procedure outlined in [16], the R2 space can be

each of which is formed by joining the origin and the vertices

As in Appendix A, we consider the unitarily equivalent

of N = 2, since constellations with N = 1 are special cases

of constellations with N = 2.
Since z is AWGN, the decision region for the symbol si
is a polygon, denoted by Ωi , and the corresponding SER is
