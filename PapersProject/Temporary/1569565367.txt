typically investigated either under a noiseless setting, or
based on statistical reconstruction measures (e.g. mean
squared error (MSE)). Berger et. al. [5] related MSEbased optimal sampling with capacity for several special
channels but did not derive the sampled capacity for
more general channels. Our recent work [6] established a
new framework that characterized sub-Nyquist sampled
channel capacity for a broad class of sampling methods,
including ﬁlter-bank and modulation-bank sampling [3],
[7]. For these sampling methods, we determined optimal
sampling structures based on capacity as a metric, illuminated intriguing connections between MIMO channel
capacity and capacity of undersampled channels, as well
as a new connection between capacity and MSE.
One interesting fact we discovered in this previous
work is the non-monotonicity of capacity with sampling rate under ﬁlter- and modulation-bank sampling,
assuming an equal sampling rate per branch for a given
number of branches. This indicates that more sophisticated sampling schemes, adaptive to the sampling rate,
are needed to maximize capacity under sub-Nyquist
rate constraints, including both uniform and nonuniform
sampling. Beurling pioneered the investigation of general
nonuniform sampling for bandlimited functions. However, it is unclear which sampling method can best exploit the channel structure, thereby maximizing sampled
capacity under a sub-Nyquist sampling rate constraint.
Although several classes of sampling methods were
shown in [6] to have a closed-form capacity solution,
the capacity limit might not exist for general sampling.
It remains unknown whether there exists a capacity upper
bound over a general class of sub-Nyquist sampling
systems and, if so, when the bound is achievable.
In this paper, we derive the sub-Nyquist sampled
channel capacity for a general class of time-preserving
nonuniform sampling methods. We demonstrate that the
fundamental limit can be achieved through ﬁlter-bank
sampling with varied sampling rate at different branches,
or a single branch of modulation and ﬁltering followed

Abstract—This paper develops the fundamental capacity
limits of a sampled analog channel under a sub-Nyquist
sampling rate constraint. In particular, we derive the
capacity of sampled analog channels over a general class
of time-preserving sampling methods including irregular
nonuniform sampling. Our results indicate that the optimal
sampling structures extract out the set of frequencies
that exhibits the highest SNR among all spectral sets of
support size equal to the sampling rate. The capacity under
sub-Nyquist sampling can be attained through ﬁlter-bank
sampling, or through a single branch of modulation and
ﬁltering followed by uniform sampling. The capacity under
sub-Nyquist sampling is a monotone function of the sampling rate. These results indicate that the optimal sampling
schemes suppress aliasing, and that employing irregular
nonuniform sampling does not provide capacity gain over
uniform sampling sets with appropriate preprocessing for
a large class of channels.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Capacity of analog channels along with the capacityachieving transmission strategies was pioneered by Shannon. These results have provided fundamental insights
for modern communication system design. Most Shannon capacity results (e.g. [1], [2]) focus on the analog capacity commensurate with sampling at or above twice the
channel bandwidth, which does not explicitly account for
the effects upon capacity of sub-Nyquist rate sampling.
In practice, however, hardware and power limitations
may preclude sampling at the Nyquist rate associated
with the channel bandwidth. On the other hand, although
the Nyquist sampling rate is necessary for perfect recovery of bandlimited functions, this rate can be excessive
when certain signal structures are properly exploited.
Inspired by recent “compressive sensing” ideas, subNyquist sampling approaches have been developed to
exploit the structure of various classes of input signals
with different structures (e.g. [3], [4]).
Although optimal sampling methods have been extensively explored in the sampling literature, they are

sampling sets, which are more complicated to realize
in hardware, do not provide capacity increase compared
with regular uniform sampling sets for a broad class of
channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal
sampling schemes suppress aliasing through ﬁlter bank,
modulation, or input optimization.

Given a preprocessed output yk (t), we can use Beurling density to characterize the sampling rate on yk (t).
However, since the preprocessor might distort the time
scale of the input, the resulting “sampling rate” might
not make physical sense, as illustrated below.
Example 1 (Compressor). Consider a preprocessor deﬁned by the relation y(t) = T (r(t)) = r (Lt) with
L ≥ 2 being a positive integer. If we apply a uniform
sampling set Λ = {tn : tn = n/fs } on y(t), then the
sampled sequence at a “sampling rate” fs is given by
y[n] = y (n/fs ) = r (nL/fs ), which corresponds to
sampling r(t) at rate fs /L. The compressor effectively
time-warps the signal, thus resulting in a mismatch of
the time scales between the input and output.

II. S AMPLED C HANNEL C APACITY
A. System Model
We consider a waveform channel, which is modeled as a linear time-invariant (LTI) ﬁlter with impulse response h(t) and frequency response H(f ) =
´∞
−j2πf t dt. The channel output is given by
−∞ h(t)e
r(t) = h(t) ∗ x(t) + η(t),

(1)

The example of the compressor illustrates that the
notion of a given sampling rate may be misleading for
systems that exhibit time warping. Hence, our results will
focus on sampling that preserves time scales. A class of
linear systems that preserves time scales are modulation
operators (y(t) = p(t)x(t), ∀t), which perform pointwise
scaling of the input, and hence do not change the time
scale. Another class are periodic systems which includes
LTI ﬁltering, and are deﬁned as follows.

where x(t) is the transmitted signal, and η(t) is stationary Gaussian noise with power spectral density Sη (f ).
We assume throughout that perfect channel state information is known at both the transmitter and receiver.
The analog channel output is passed through M (1 ≤
M ≤ ∞) linear preprocessing systems each followed
by a pointwise sampler, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The
preprocessed output yk (t) at the k th branch is obtained
by applying a linear operator Tk to r(t), i.e. yk (t) =
Tk (r(t)). The linear operators can be time-varying, and
include ﬁltering and modulation as special cases. We
deﬁne the impulse response q(t, τ ) of a time-varying
system as the output seen at time t due to an impulse
in the input at time τ . The pointwise sampler following
the preprocessor can be nonuniform. The preprocessed
output yk (t) is sampled at times tk,n (n ∈ Z), yielding
a sequence yk [n] = yk (tk,n ) . At the k th branch, the
sampling set is deﬁned by Λk := {tk,n | n ∈ Z} . When
tk,n = nTs , Λk is said to be uniform with period Ts .

Figure 1.
The input x(t) is constrained to [−T, T ] and passed
through an analog channel and contaminated by noise η(t). The analog channel output r(t) is then passed through a linear preprocessing
system T . The preprocessed output y(t) is observed over [−T, T ]
and sampled on the sampling set Λ = {tn | n ∈ Z}.

B. Sampling Rate
In general, the sampling set Λ may be irregular. This
calls for a generalized deﬁnition of the sampling rate.
One notion commonly used in sampling theory is the
Beurling density [8] as deﬁned below.

Deﬁnition 2 (Periodic System). A linear preprocessing
system is said to be periodic with period Tq if its impulse
response q(t, τ ) satisﬁes

Deﬁnition 1 (Beurling Density). For a sampling set Λ,
the upper and lower Beurling density are deﬁned as
￿
D+ (Λ) = limr→∞ supz∈R cardinality(Λ∩[z,z+r]) ,
r
D− (Λ) = limr→∞ inf z∈R cardinality(Λ∩[z,z+r]) .
r

q(t, τ ) = q(t + Tq , τ + Tq ),

∀t, τ ∈ R.

(2)

A more general class of systems that preserve the time
scale can be generated through modulation and periodic
subsystems. Speciﬁcally, we can deﬁne a general timepreserving system by connecting a set of modulation or
periodic operators in parallel or in serial. This leads to
the following deﬁnition.

When D+ (Λ) = D− (Λ), the sampling set Λ is said to
be of uniform Beurling density D (Λ) := D− (Λ).
When the sampling set is uniform with period Ts , the
Beurling density is D(Λ) = 1/Ts , which coincides with
our conventional deﬁnition of the sampling rate.

Deﬁnition 3 (Time-preserving System). Given an index
set I , a preprocessing system T : x(t) ￿→ {yk (t), k ∈ I}
is said to be time-preserving if
(1) The system input is passed through |I| (possibly
countably many) branches of linear preprocessors, yielding a set of analog outputs {yk (t) | k ∈ I}.
(2) In each branch, the preprocessor comprises a set
of periodic or modulation operators connected in serial.

deﬁne the sub-Nyquist sampled channel capacity for the
class of linear time-preserving systems as follows.
Deﬁnition 6 (Sampled Capacity under Time-preserving Linear Sampling). (1) C(fs , P ) is said to be the
sampled capacity of an analog channel under timepreserving linear sampling for a given sampling rate fs
if C(fs , P ) = supP C P (fs , P );
(2) Cu (P ) is said to be a capacity upper bound of
the sampled channel under this sampling if Cu (fs , P ) ≥
P
supP lim supT →∞ CT (fs , P ).
Here, the supremum on P is over all time-preserving
linear sampling systems.

With a preprocessing system that preserves the time
scale, we can now deﬁne the aggregate sampling rate
through Beurling density.
Deﬁnition 4. A sampling system is said to be timepreserving with sampling rate fs if
(1) Its preprocessing system T is time-preserving.
(2) The preprocessed output yk (t) is sampled by a
sampling set Λk = {tl,k | l ∈￿} with a uniform Beurling
Z
density fk,s , which satisﬁes k∈I fk,s = fs .

III. C APACITY A NALYSIS
A. An Upper Bound on Sampled Channel Capacity
A time-preserving sampling system preserves the time
scale of the signal, and hence does not compress or
expand the frequency response. We now determine an
upper limit on the sampled channel capacity for this class
of general nonuniform sampling systems.

C. Capacity Deﬁnition

Suppose that the transmit signal x(t) is constrained
to the time interval [−T, T ], and the received signal
y(t) is sampled and observed over [−T, T ]. For a given
sampling system P that consists of a preprocessor T
and a sampling set Λ, and a given time duration T , the
P
capacity CT (fs , P ) is deﬁned as

p(x) 2T

subject to a power constraint E( 2T −T |x(t)|2 dt) ≤ P .
Here, {y[tn ]}[−T,T ] denotes the set of samples obtained
within time [−T, T ]. The sub-Nyquist sampled channel
capacity for the given system can be studied by taking the limit as T → ∞. It was shown in [6] that
P
limT →∞ CT (fs , P ) exists for a broad class of sampling
methods. We caution, however, that the existence of the
limit is not guaranteed for all sampling methods, e.g. the
limit might not exist for an irregular sampling set. The
capacity and an upper bound under general nonuniform
sampling is deﬁned as follows.

Theorem 1 (Converse). Consider a time-preserving
sampling system with sampling rate fs . Suppose that the
output impulse response of the sampled channel is of
ﬁnite duration, and that there exists a frequency set Bm
that satisﬁes µ (Bm ) = fs and

where µ (·) denotes the Lebesgue measure. Then the

In other words, the upper limit is equivalent to the
maximum capacity of a channel whose spectral occupancy is no larger than fs . The above result basically
implies that even if we allow for more complex irregular
sampling sets, the sampled capacity cannot exceed the
one commensurate with the analog capacity when constraining all transmit signals to the interval of bandwidth
fs that experience the highest SNR. Accordingly, the
optimal input distribution will lie in this frequency set.
This theorem also indicates that the capacity is attained
when aliasing is suppressed by the sampling structure,

The above capacity is deﬁned for a speciﬁc sampling
system. Another metric of interest is the maximum date
rate for all sampling schemes within a general class
of nonuniform sampling systems. This motivates us to

Qk (f ) := −∞ q(tk , tk − t) exp(−j2πf t)dt, and introduce an fq Ts × ∞ dimensional matrix Fq (f ) and an
inﬁnite diagonal square matrix Fh (f ) such that for all
m, l ∈ Z and 1 ≤ k ≤ fq Ts ,

h(t)
as will be seen later in our capacity-achieving scheme.
When the optimal frequency interval Bm is selected, a
water ﬁlling power allocation strategy is performed over
the spectral domain with water level ν .
This theorem can be approximately interpreted based
on a Fourier domain analysis. The Fourier transform of
the analog channel output is given by H(f )X(f )+N (f ),
where X(f ) and N (f ) denote, respectively, the Fourier
response of x(t) and η(t). This output is passed through
the sampling system to yield a sequence at a rate fs ,
which can be further mapped to the space of bandlimited functions L2 (−fs /2, fs /2) through linear mapping
without frequency warping. The whitening operation
for the noise component, combined with the sampling
system operator, forms an orthonormal mapping from
L2 (−∞, ∞) to L2 (−fs /2, fs /2). The optimal orthonormal mapping that maximizes SNR is to extract out a
frequency set Bm of size fs that contains the frequency
components with the highest SNR, which leads to the
capacity upper bound (3).
The outline of the proof of Theorem 1 is sketched
below. We start from the capacity of periodic sampling
whose sampled channel capacity exists, and then derive
the upper bound through ﬁnite-duration approximation
of the true channels. Details can be found in [9].

(Fq )k,l (f ) := Qk (f + lfq ) ,

We can then express in closed form the sampled analog
capacity as given in the following theorem.

the sampling system P is periodic with period Tq = 1/fq
and sampling rate fs . Assume that |H(f )Qk (f )|2 /Sη (f )

We observe that the capacity of any periodic sampling
system cannot exceed the capacity (3).
Now we consider the more general sampling system
that might not be periodic. For a given input and
output duration [−T, T ], the impulse response h(t, τ )
(|t|, |τ | ≤ T ) can be extended periodically to generate
an impulse response of a periodic system. Suppose ﬁrst
that the impulse response is of ﬁnite duration, then for
sufﬁciently large T , the sampled capacity CT can be
upper bounded arbitrarily closely by the capacity of the
generated periodic system, which are further bounded
by the upper limit (3). Since the impulse response is
constrained in L2 space, the leakage signal between
different blocks can be made arbitrarily weak by introducing a guard zone with length T 1−￿ . This shows the
full generality of our upper bound.

is preﬁltered by a ﬁlter with impulse response p(t), modulated by
a sequence q(t), post-ﬁltered by another ﬁlter of impulse response

For most scenarios of physical interest, the capacity
upper bound given in Theorem 1 can be achieved through
ﬁlter-bank sampling.
Theorem 3 (Achievability). Suppose that the SNR
|H(f )|2 /Sη (f ) of the analog channel is continuous and
Riemann integrable. Then the maximizing frequency set
Bm deﬁned in Theorem 1 can be divided into Bm =
∪i Bi ∪ D, where D contains a set of singular points,
Bi is a continuous interval, and D and Bi (i ∈ N) are
non-overlapping sets. The upper bound in (3) can be
achieved by ﬁlter-bank sampling. Speciﬁcally, in the k th

Suppose ﬁrst that the whole sampling system is periodic, where the impulse response q(t, τ ) is periodic
with period Tq (fs Tq ∈ Z) and the sampling set
obeys tk+fs Tq = tk + Tq , ∀k ∈ Z. The periodicity
P
of the system guarantees the existence of limT →∞ CT .
Speciﬁcally, denote by Qk (f ) the Fourier transform

Alias suppression. Aliasing does not allow a higher
capacity to be achieved. The optimal sampling method
corresponds to the optimal alias-suppression strategy.
This is in contrast to the beneﬁts obtained through
scrambling of spectral contents in many sub-Nyquist
sampling schemes with unknown signal supports.
Perturbation of sampling set. If the optimal ﬁlterbank or modulation sampling is employed, mild perturbation of post-ﬁltering uniform sampling sets does
not degrade the sampled capacity. For example, suppose
ˆ￿
that a sampling rate fs is used in any branch and the

tion integrity. The sampled capacity is invariant under
mild perturbation of the sampling sets.
Hardware implementation. When the sampling rate
is increased from fs1 to fs2 , we need only to insert an
additional ﬁlter bank of overall sampling rate fs2 −fs1 to
select another set of spectral components with bandwidth
fs2 − fs1 . The adjustment of the hardware system for
ﬁlter-bank sampling is incremental with no need to
rebuild the whole system from scratch.

branch, the frequency response of the ﬁlter is given by
￿
1, if f ∈ Bk ,
Sk (f ) =
0, otherwise,
and the ﬁlter is followed by a uniform sampler with
sampling rate µ (Bk ).
Since the bandwidth of Bi may be irrational and the
system may require an inﬁnite number of ﬁlters, the
sampling system is in general aperiodic. However, ﬁlterbank sampling with varied sampling rates in different
branches outperforms all other sampling mechanisms in
maximizing capacity.
The optimality of ﬁlter-bank sampling immediately
leads to another optimal sampling structure. As we have
shown in [6], ﬁlter-bank sampling can be replaced by a
single branch of modulation and ﬁltering as illustrated
in Fig. 2, which can approach the capacity arbitrarily closely if the spectral support can be divided into
subbands with constant SNR. A channel of physical
interest can often be approximated as piecewise constant
in this way. Given the maximizing frequency set Bm ,
we ﬁrst suppress the frequency components outside Bm
using an LTI preﬁlter. A modulation module is then
applied to move all frequency components within Bm
to the baseband [−fs /2, fs /2]. The aliasing effect can
be signiﬁcantly mitigated by appropriate choices of
modulation weights for different spectral subbands. We
then employ another low-pass ﬁlter to suppress out-ofband signals, and sample the output using a pointwise
uniform sampler. The optimizing modulation sequence
can be found in [6], [9]. Compared with ﬁlter-bank
sampling, a single branch of modulation and ﬁltering
only requires the design of a low-pass ﬁlter, a band-pass
ﬁlter and a multiplication module, which are typically
lower complexity to implement than a ﬁlter bank.

IV. D ISCUSSION
The above analytical results characterize the sampled
capacity for a general class of sampling methods. Some
properties of the capacity results are as follows.
Monotonicity. It can be seen from (3) that increasing
˜
the sampling rate from fs to fs requires us to crop out
˜
˜m of size fs that has the highest
another frequency set B
SNRs. The original frequency set Bm we choose must
˜
be a subset of Bm , and hence the sampled capacity with
˜ is no lower than that with rate fs .
rate fs
Irregular sampling set. Sampling with irregular
sampling sets, while requiring complicated reconstruction techniques [8], does not outperform ﬁlter-bank or
modulation-bank sampling with regular uniform sampling sets in maximizing achievable data rate.
