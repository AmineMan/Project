Abstract—In this paper, for an odd prime p such that p ≡
3 mod 4, odd n, and d = (pn + 1)/(pk + 1) + (pn − 1)/2 with
k|n, the value distribution of the exponential sum S(a, b) when
a and b run through Fpn is calculated. The weight distribution
of the relevant cyclic code C over Fp with the length L = pn − 1
and the dimension dimFp C = 2n is also derived. Our result
generalizes the case in [5].

I. I NTRODUCTION
Cyclic codes are the most important class of linear block
codes for a wide variety of applications. However, not much is
known about the weight distributions of these codes except in
very speciﬁc cases. Especially, for an odd prime p, the value
distribution of the exponential sum and the weight distribution
of the relevant cyclic code are derived [3],[4]. Recently, the
value distribution of the exponential sum for d = (pn +1)/(p+
1) + (pn − 1)/2, odd prime p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4, and odd
n is derived in [5].
In this paper, the value distribution of the exponential sum
is calculated for d = (pn + 1)/(pk + 1) + (pn − 1)/2 with k|n,
an odd prime p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4, and odd n, which
contains the result of [5] as a special case. Deploying the
result, the weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code C is
also derived.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, some
preliminaries and notations are stated. In Section III, the value
distribution of the exponential sum is derived. In Section
IV, the weight distribution of the relevant cyclic code C is
calculated. In Section V, we conclude the paper.

Hw (c(a, b)) = {i|0 ≤ i ≤ L − 1, ci = 0} .
B. Quadratic Form
We deﬁne a quadratic form in k variables over Fps as a
homogeneous polynomial in Fps [x1 , . . . , xk ]
k

i,j=1

where p is an odd prime and aij = aji ∈ Fps . We then
associate f with the k × k symmetric matrix A whose (i, j)
entry is aij . The matrix A is called the coefﬁcient matrix of f
and r denotes the rank of A. Then, there exists a nonsingular
k × k matrix B over Fps such that C = BAB T is a diagonal
∗
matrix and C = diag(c1 , . . . , cr , 0, · · · , 0), where ci ∈ Fps .
Let ∆ = c1 · · · cr and η be the quadratic character of Fps ,
which will be used in the following lemmas. A quadratic form
f (x) in k variables over Fps can be regarded as a mapping
f (x) from Fpsk to Fps when xi ∈ Fps . Thus, we will also use
the term ‘quadratic form’ for this mapping f (x) in Fpsk .
Lemma 1: Consider the following function of x ∈ Fpn

II. N OTATIONS AND P RELIMINARIES

is a quadratic form over Fps .
Lemma 2 (Luo and Feng [3]): The rank r of the quadratic
form f (x) from Fpsk to Fps can be determined from the number of elements that the form is independent of, i.e., (ps )k−r is
the number of y ∈ Fpsk such that f (x + y) − f (x) − f (y) = 0
for all x ∈ Fpsk .

where x ∈ Fpn and m|n. Let α be a primitive element of Fpn

and Fpn = Fpn \ {0}.

e − 1, or e − 2, where e = n/k. Similarly, the corresponding
linearized polynomial of Q2 (x) is given as φ−a,b (x) and the
possible rank of Q2 (x) is also e, e − 1, or e − 2.

From the two techniques in [5], some exponential sum

values which actually do not occur can be ruled out for explicit
some parameters used in the remainder of this paper:

• p is an odd prime such that p ≡ 3 mod 4;

Lemma 3 (Luo and Feng [3]): Let f (x) be a mapping
from Fpsk to Fps corresponding to a quadratic form f (x) ∈
Fps [x1 , x2 , . . . , xk ] of rank r with ∆. Then we have

Lemma 5: At least one of φa,b (x) and φ−a,b (x) has a single
root in Fpn , i.e., one of the two quadratic forms Q1 (x) and
Q2 (x) must have the rank e.

• n is an odd integer;
• d = (pn + 1)/(pk + 1) + (pn − 1)/2 with k|n.
B. Evaluation of S(a, b)

Lemma 6 (Theorem 5.38 [6]): Let f (x) ∈ Fpn [x] be a
polynomial of degree l ≥ 1 with gcd(l, pn ) = 1 and let χ
be a nontrivial additive character of Fpn . Then

When either a or b is equal to zero, S(a, b) is given as the
following lemma.
Lemma 4: When either a or b is equal to zero, S(a, b) is
determined as

In [5], they used the wise method to exclude some exponential sum values which do not occur by using Weil’s bound
in Lemma 6. Similarly, the following lemma can be derived.

Note that gcd(pk + 1, pn − 1) = 2 and −1 is a nonsquare

in Fpn . Then, for a, b ∈ Fpn , S(a, b) can be transformed into
the exponential sums of the quadratic forms as

So far, it is derived that the exponential sum S(a, b) can
have the ten candidate values as in Theorem 8. Let vi , 0 ≤
i ≤ 9, be the i-th value in (4) through the given order. Let
Ωi , 0 ≤ i ≤ 9, be the number of occurrences of vi when a
and b run through Fpn . Note that each conjugate pair has the
same number of occurrences. Hence we need ﬁve independent
equations in terms of Ωi to determine the distribution. It is easy
to derive the following three equations

able to calculate the exponential sums S1 (a, b) and S2 (a, b).
From Lemma 2, in order to derive the rank of the quadratic
form Q1 (x), we need to calculate the number of solutions
x ∈ Fpn satisfying

From the results in [7], the distribution of the ranks of the
quadratic forms Q1 (x) and Q2 (x) when a and b run through

Fpn can be derived. Hence the remaining two equations in
terms of Ωi ’s can be obtained from the rank distribution.
From the above lemma, the following lemma is derived.

In this paper, the value distribution of the exponential
sum S(a, b) when a and b run through Fpn and the weight
distribution of the relevant cyclic code C over Fp with the
length L = pn − 1 and the dimension dimFp C = 2n
are derived for an odd prime p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4,
d = (pn + 1)/(pk + 1) + (pn − 1)/2 with k|n, and odd n. Our
result includes the result in [5] as a special case.
