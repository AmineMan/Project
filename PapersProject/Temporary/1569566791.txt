Given a character χ of the additive group (R, +) and a ring
element b in R, we observe that χb (x) := χ(bx) is again a
character of (R, +).

Abstract—Quantum error-correcting codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds
have been widely studied, but quantum codes over rings have
been left largely unexplored. This paper introduces stabilizer
codes over ﬁnite Frobenius rings and establishes their connection
to classical code. Structural properties of stabilizer codes over
ﬁnite Frobenius rings are established. It is proved that free
stabilizer codes over ﬁnite commutative chain rings cannot
outperform stabilizer codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds.

Proposition 1. The operators E = {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ R}
form an orthonormal basis with respect to the normalized
Hilbert-Schmidt inner product if and only if C = {χb | b ∈ R}
is the set of all irreducible characters of the additive group
(R, +).

I. I NTRODUCTION

Proof: See [3, Lemma 2]
Let R be a ﬁnite ring. We denote by Irr(R) =
Hom((R, +), C× ) the set of irreducible characters of the
additive group (R, +). We say that an irreducible character χ
of (R, +) is generating if and only if Irr(R) = {χb | b ∈ R},
where χb (x) = χ(bx) for all x in R. A ﬁnite ring R does not
necessarily have a generating character. We call a ring nice if
and only if it has a generating character. From the deﬁnition
of Frobenius rings which says a ring is Frobenius if and only
if it admits a left or a right generating character it implies that
a Frobenius ring is a nice ring. Thus for a Frobenius ring, the
operators X(a)Z(b) form an orthonormal basis.

Stabilizer codes over ﬁnite ﬁelds found numerous applications, but stabilizer codes over rings remained so far a
largely unexplored territory. This is unfortunate, since the
arithmetic over rings can be much simpler when compared
to the arithmetic over the ﬁelds. Therefore, stabilizer codes
over rings might be an interesting choice in applications of
fault-tolerant quantum computing.
In this paper, we develop the theory of stabilizer codes over
Frobenius rings. We brieﬂy discuss the discretization using
nice error bases. Then we establish the connection of stabilizer
codes to classical codes. Subsequently we restrict our attention
to the ﬁnite chain rings to get good estimates for the minimum
distance of stabilizer codes over such rings.

Lemma 2. If R is a ﬁnite Frobenius ring with generating
character χ, then the set E = {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ R} is a
nice error basis on Cq .

II. D ISCRETIZATION
Let R be a ﬁnite ring with q elements. We denote by B =
{|x | x ∈ R} an orthonormal basis of Cq with respect to the
usual hermitian inner product.
The addition and multiplication in the ring R will be used
to deﬁne unitary shift and multiplication operators on Cq . For
each a, b in R, we deﬁne a shift operator X(a) : Cq → Cq
and a multiplication operator Z(b) : Cq → Cq by
X(a)|x = |x + a ,

Proof: A Frobenius ring is a nice ring by [3, Theorem
7], hence E is a nice error basis.
III. B ILINEAR F ORMS
Let a = (a1 , . . . , an ) and b = (b1 , . . . , bn ) in Rn . By slight
abuse of notation, we deﬁne shift and multiplication operators
n
on n quantum system with state space Cq ⊗ · · · ⊗ Cq ∼ Cq
=
by
X(a) = X(a1 ) ⊗ X(a2 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ X(an ),
Z(b) = Z(b1 ) ⊗ Z(b2 ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Z(bn ).

Z(b)|x = χ(bx)|x ,

where x in R, and χ is an irreducible character of the additive
abelian group (R, +).
Let us consider the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt inner product A | B = 1 tr(A† B) on the set of linear operators of Cq ,
q
where tr denotes the trace of a matrix, and A† is the adjoint
of the operator A. Our goal is to determine when the set

n

Having deﬁned the operators on the space Cq , and the proof
for nice error basis above we state the following corollary.
Corollary 3. The set E = {X(a)Z(b)|a, b ∈ Rn } is a nice
n
error basis on Cq .
Now let us consider the error group generated by the the
nice error basis above. By including scalar multiples of the
operators of the error basis, we get its associated error group
as follows:

E = {X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ R}
forms an orthonormal basis of the set of linear operators on
Cq .

right ideal ui R must be contained in the kernel of χ if i is in
the range n ≤ i ≤ 2n − 1. Since χ is a generating character,
any right or left ideal contained in the kernel of χ must be
{0}, so ui must be 0, contradicting our assumption that u = 0.
The property (5) can be proved in a similar way.
We call u and v in R2n orthogonal, written u ⊥ v, if and
only if u | v χ = 0. For a subset S of R2n , we deﬁne

where ω = exp(2πi/m) is a primitive root of unity and m is
the exponent of the group (R, +).
The next proposition gives a convenient criterion to decide
whether two operators of the error group commute.
Proposition 4. Let R be a nice ring with generating character
χ. Let a, b and a , b be elements of Rn . Then the operators
X(a)Z(b) and X(a )Z(b ) of the error group commute if and
only if χ(b · a − b · a) = 1 (where ’.’ represents the regular
inner product) holds.

S ⊥ = {u ∈ R2n | s | u
S = {u ∈ R2n | u | s

⊥

(a|b) | (a |b )

X(a)Z(b)|x = X(a)χ(b · x)|x = χ(b · x)|x + a ,

We write u ⊥s v iff u | v
follows:

Z(b)X(a)|x = Z(b)|x + a = χ(b · x)χ(b · a)|x + a ,
hence χ(b · a)X(a)Z(b) = Z(b)X(a). It follows that
=
=

χ(b · a)X(a + a )Z(b + b ).

(a|b) | (a |b )

χ

= 0. The forms are related as

Lemma 6. Let R be a nice ring with generating character χ.
Let C be a subgroup of (R2n , +). Then
|C| |C ⊥ | = |R2n |

and

|C| |⊥ C| = |R2n |

Proof: For each v in R2n , the map Φv : R2n → C given
by

χ(x) = exp(2πiψ(x)).
χ:

s

= b · a − b · a.

The following lemma establishes the relationship between
the cardinality of code C and its dual codes C ⊥ and ⊥ C.

Therefore, we can conclude that X(a)Z(b) and X(a )Z(b )
commute if and only if χ(b · a − b · a) = 1, as claimed.
Consider the additive group of the ring R. For each character χ in Hom(R, C× ) there exists a unique function ψ in
Hom(R, Q/Z) such that

We can deﬁne a form · | ·

s

χ( u | v s ) = χ(b · a − b · a) = exp(2πi u | v χ ).

X(a )Z(b )X(a)Z(b)

χ

= 0 for all s ∈ S}
= 0 for all s ∈ S}.

In addition to · | · χ , it will be convenient to deﬁne a form
· | · s : R2n × R2n → R by

Proof: For any x ∈ Rn , we have

X(a)Z(b)X(a )Z(b )

χ

Φv (x) = χ( x | v s ) = exp(2πi x | v χ )

R2n × R2n → Q/Z such that

is an irreducible character of (R2n , +). The set {Φv | v ∈
R2n } actually contains all irreducible characters of (R2n , +),
since it follows from Lemma 5 (5) that Φv = Φv if and only
if v = v .
The set of characters of (R2n , +) that are equal to 1 when
restricted to C is given by {Φv | v ∈ C ⊥ }, hence there
are precisely |C ⊥ | such characters. On the other hand, the
characters of (R2n , +) that are equal to 1 when restricted to C
correspond to the inﬂations of characters of the quotient group
R2n /C, hence there are [R2n : C] such characters. Therefore,
we have |C||C ⊥ | = |C|[R2n : C] = |R2n |, as claimed.
One can show that |C| |⊥ C| = |R2n | in a similar way.

= ψ(b · a − b · a)

for all (a|b) and (a |b ) in R .
The properties (1), (2), and (3) of the next lemma show
that · | · χ is a Z-bilinear form, and the properties (4) and (5)
show that the form is left- and right nondegenerate.
Lemma 5. Let R be a nice ring with generating character χ.
Then
(1) u1 + u2 | v χ = u1 | v χ + u2 | v χ
(2) u | v1 + v2 χ = u | v1 χ + u | v2 χ
(3) nu | v χ = u | nv χ = n u | v χ
holds for all u1 , u2 , v and u, v1 , v2 in R2n , and all n in Z.
Furthermore,
(4) if u | v χ = 0 holds for all v in R2n , then u = 0.
(5) if u | v χ = 0 holds for all u in R2n , then v = 0.

IV. S TABILIZER C ODES
Let R be a nice ring and n a positive integer. Suppose
that the group X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ Rn has exponent m. Let
ω denote a primitive mth root of unity, ω = exp(2πi/m).
We deﬁne the error group Gn generated by the operators
X(a)Z(b), a, b ∈ Rn , as

Proof: The properties (1), (2), and (3) follow from the
biadditivity of the dot product, the distributive law, and the
fact that ψ is a homomorphism.
To prove property (4), consider an element u =
(u0 , . . . , un−1 |un , . . . , u2n−1 ) in R2n . Seeking a contradiction, suppose that u = 0 but u | v χ = 0 holds for all v in R2n .
Let i be the smallest index such that ui = 0. Let di denote
the element in R2n that takes the value 1 at coordinate i + n
(mod 2n) and is 0 everywhere else. Then u | di r χ = 0 for
all r in R shows that (i) the left ideal Rui must be contained
in the kernel of χ if i is in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1; (ii) the

Gn = ω c X(a)Z(b) | a, b ∈ Rn , c ∈ Z .
The center Z(Gn ) of the group Gn is given by Z(Gn ) =
{ω c 1 | c ∈ Z}, a group of order m.
We deﬁne the weight wt(g) of an element g in Gn to be
the number of non-scalar tensor components of g. For (a|b)
in R2n , we deﬁne its symplectic weight swt((a|b)) to be the
number of indices i such that ai = 0 or bi = 0. It follows that
wt(ω c X(a)Z(b)) = swt((a|b)).

Let R be a ring with q elements. Let S be a subgroup of
Gn . The stabilizer code Fix(S) associated with S is given by

stabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain rings to stabilizer codes over
ﬁnite ﬁelds.
A ﬁnite chain ring is a ﬁnite local principal ideal ring. Let J
denote the Jacobson radical of a ﬁnite chain ring R, that is,
J is the unique maximal ideal of R. The smallest positive
integer ν such that J ν = {0} is called the nilpotency index
of J. The nilpotency index of J and the size of the ﬁnite ﬁeld
R/J are two crucial parameters of a ﬁnite chain ring R, as
the following well-known lemma shows.

n

Fix(S) = {v ∈ Cq | Ev = v for all E ∈ S}.
n

In general, a quantum code Q is a subspace of Cq . We call
Q a stabilizer code if and only if there exists a subgroup S of
Gn such that Fix(S) = Q.
Theorem 7. An ((n, K, d))R stabilizer code exists if and only
if there exists an additive code C ≤ R2n of size |C| =
|R|n /K such that C ≤ C ⊥ and swt(C ⊥ \ C) = d if K > 1,
and swt(C⊥ − {0}) = d if K = 1.

Lemma 8. Let R be a ﬁnite chain ring with Jacobson radical
J. If the ﬁnite ﬁeld R/J has q elements, and J has nilpotency
index ν, then

Proof: Suppose that an ((n, K, d))R stabilizer code Q
exists. This implies that there exists a subgroup S of Gn
of order |R|n /K such that Fix(S) = Q. Let C be the
subgroup of R2n given by C ∼ SZ(Gn )/Z(Gn ). Then
=
|C| = |S| = |R|n /K. We have C ⊥ ∼ CGn (S)/Z(Gn ). Since
=
S is an abelian group, we have SZ(Gn ) ≤ CGn (S), and
hence C ≤ C ⊥ . The weight of an element ω c X(a)Z(b) is
equal to the swt(a|b). If K = 1 then Q is a pure quantum
code, thus wt(CGn (S) \ Z(Gn )) = swt(C ⊥ − {0}) = d. If
K > 1, then the elements of CGn (S) \ SZ(Gn ) have at least
weight d so that swt(C ⊥ \ C) = d.
Conversely, suppose that C is an additive code of R2n such
that |C| = |R|n /K, C ≤ C ⊥ , and swt(C ⊥ \C) = d if K > 1,
and swt(C ⊥ − {0}) = d if K=1. Let N = {ω c X(a)Z(b)|c ∈
Z and (a|b) ∈ C}. This is an abelian normal subgroup of the
group Gn ; indeed, it is normal because it is the pre-image of
C = N/Z(Gn ), and abelian since C is self-orthogonal.
Choose a character φ of N such that φ(ω c 1) = ω c for
c ∈ Z. Then

|J i | = q ν−i

and |R/J i | = q i

for 1 ≤ i ≤ ν. In particular, the number of elements of the
ring R and of its Jacobson radical J are respectively given
by |R| = q ν and |J| = q ν−1 .
Proof: Since J annihilates J i /J i+1 for all i in the range
1 ≤ i < ν, we can regard J i /J i+1 as an R/J-module, so it
is a vector space over the ﬁeld F = R/J. Since R is a ﬁnite
chain ring, there exists an element γ in R such that J i = Rγ i ,
so J i is a cyclic R-module. Therefore, J i /J i+1 = J i /JJ i is
a one-dimensional vector space over F ; hence, it follows that
|J i /J i+1 | = q for all 1 ≤ i < ν. Therefore, we can conclude
that |J i | = q ν−i holds for all i in the range 1 ≤ i ≤ ν, as
claimed.
Since J i is the annihilator of J ν−i , we have R/J i ∼ J ν−i
=
as left R-modules; hence, |R/J i | = |J ν−i | = q i for all i in the
range 1 ≤ i < ν. Furthermore, |R| = |R/J||J| = ppν−1 =
pν . Therefore, |R/J i | = q i holds for the full range 1 ≤ i ≤ ν,
as claimed.
Linear codes are deﬁned as modules over rings. The next
lemma shows that for a linear code C over a ﬁnite commutative chain ring, we have C ⊥ = C ⊥s and later we proceed to
establish the structure of modules over ﬁnite chain ring.

E∈N

is an orthogonal projector onto a vector space Q, because PN
is idempotent in the group ring C[Gn ]. We have
dim Q = Tr PN = |Z(Gn )||Rn |/|N | = |Rn |/|C| = K.

Lemma 9. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring with
generating character χ. Let C and D be R-submodules of
R2n . Then C ⊥ D if and only if C ⊥s D.

Each coset of N modulo Z(Gn ) contains exactly one matrix
E such that Ev = v for all v in Q. Let S = {E ∈ N |Ev =
v for all ∈ Q}. Then S is an abelian subgroup of Gn and its
order is given by |S| = |C| = |R|n /K. The vector space Q
is clearly a subspace of Fix(S) and dim Q = |R|n /|S|, hence
Q = Fix(S).
If K > 1, then an element ω c X(a)Z(b) in CGn \SZ(Gn )
cannot have weight less than d, because this would imply that
(a|b) ∈ C which is not possible. If K = 1, then the same
follows for K = 1. Hence Q is an ((n, K, d))R stabilizer
code.

Proof: It follows from the deﬁnitions that C ⊥s D
implies C ⊥ D.
Conversely, suppose that C ⊥ D. Let x in C and y in D be
arbitrary elements. Since C is a module, rx in C for all r in
R. Since · | · s is a bilinear R-form when R is a commutative
ring, we have 1 = χ( rx | y s ) = χ(r x | y s ) = χr ( x | y s
for all r in R. As χ is a generating character, this means that
x | y s is in the kernel of all irreducible characters of (R, +),
and therefore x | y s = 0. This proves that C ⊥ D implies
that C ⊥s D.

V. F INITE C HAIN R INGS
In this section, we focus on stabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain
rings. Finite chain rings are local rings with the additional
constraint that its lattice of left ideals forms a chain. Classical
linear codes over ﬁnite chain rings have been studied extensively in the past, see e.g. [4], [5], [6]. Our goal it to relate

Proposition 10. Let R be a ﬁnite chain ring and R M a left Rmodule of ﬁnite cardinality |R M |. Suppose that the Jacobson
radical J of the ring R has nilpotency index ν. The there exists
a unique partition (λ1 , . . . , λr ) of logq |R M | with ν ≥ λ1 ≥

λ2 ≥ · · · ≥ λr ≥ 1 such that
RM

∼ R/J λ1 ⊕ R/J λ2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ R/J λr
=

Let us ﬁx some terminology. For an R-module M and an
element x ∈ M , we say that (a) x has period γ i iff i is the
smallest integer in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ ν satisfying γ i x = 0,
and (b) x has height i iff i ∈ {0, 1, ..., ν} is the largest integer
satisfying x = γ i y for some y ∈ M . Furthermore, we deﬁne

(1)

as a left R-module.
Proof: For any Artinian principal ideal ring R and left
R-module R M there exists a unique family (Pi , ni )i∈I such
that
(i) the Pi are maximal ideals of R;
(ii) the ni are positive integers such that ni does not exceed
the nilpotency index of the ideal Pi ;
(iii) R M ∼ ⊕i∈I R/Pi ni ;
=
see [Theorem 6.9] in [1]. A ﬁnite chain ring has a unique
maximal ideal J. The claimed decomposition (1) of R M
follows from this result. By Lemma 8, we have |R M | =
q λ1 +λ2 +···+λr , which proves that (λ1 , . . . , λr ) is a partition
of logq |R M |.
The partition λ = (λ1 , λ2 , ..., λn ) of logq |R M | is called the
shape of the module M . We call (ν − λn , . . . , ν − λ2 , ν − λ1 )
the complementary shape of λ. The conjugate λ of a partition
λ is the partition λ = (λ1 , . . . , λλ1 ) of logq |R M | with λi =
|{j; λj ≥ i}|. The largest part λ1 of the conjugate shape λ is
equal to the total number of parts of λ and is called the rank
of the module.
The next theorem establishes a relation between the shape
of the code and the shape of its dual code.

γ i M = {γ i x; x ∈ M },
M [γ i ] = {x ∈ M ; γ i x = 0}.
If M is free, the M [γ i ] = γ ν−i M for 0 ≤ i ≤ ν, cf. [6].
Lemma 12. Let C be an R-submodule of R2n of shape λ.
Suppose C has shape λ. Then dim (C : γ i ) = k0 +k1 +...+ki
where k denotes the number of parts of λ equal to ν − .
Proof: Let k be the rank of C. Then there exists a basis
c1 , c2 , ...ck of C with periods γ λ1 , γ λ2 , . . . γ λk , respectively.
We assume that the basis elements are arranged in the decreasing order of their periods. Let e be an element in (C : γ i );
hence γ i e ∈ C. Thus, there exist r1 , r2 , ....rk ∈ R such that
γ i e = r1 c1 + r2 c2 + ... + rk ck .
Since R2n is a free module we have R2n [γ i ] = γ ν−i R2n .
Hence every basis element ci can be written as ci =
(γ ν−λi ci1 , γ ν−λi ci2 , ..., γ ν−λi cin ). Therefore we can write
γ i e in the form
γie

Theorem 11. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring. Let
C ≤ R2n be a linear code over R of shape λ. Then the shape
of C ⊥ is the complementary shape of λ.

= r1 c1 + r2 c2 + ... + rj cj
+γ i (γ ν−λj+1 −i rj+1 cj+1 + .... + γ ν−λk −i rk ck )

where the index j is chosen such that λj ≥ ν − i and λj+1 <
ν − i. Hence r1 c1 + r2 c2 + ... + rj cj is also divisible by γ i .
Thus

Proof: For each v ∈ R2n , we have a linear map
φv : CR → RR , u → u|v s . Since R is commutative,
Θ : R2n → C # = Hom(C, R)R is linear map with kernel
ker Θ = C ⊥s , hence ker Θ = C ⊥ by Lemma 9. Furthermore,
Θ is surjective, see [7, Lemma 13]. Therefore, R2n /C ⊥ ∼
=
C # , and the shapes of C # and C ⊥ are complementary. A
module C and its dual C # have the same shape. Hence the
shape of C ⊥ is complementary to the shape of C.

Reducing modulo the Jacobson radical, we have e =

(C : γ i ). Since this set is independent, we have dim (C : γ i ) =
k0 + k1 + ... + ki .
Lemma 13. dim (C ⊥ : γ i ) + dim (C : γ ν−i−1 ) = 2n.

VI. S UBMODULE Q UOTIENTS
Let R be a ring and C be a submodule of the R-module
R2n . Given a ring element r, we deﬁne the submodule quotient
(C : r) as

We omit the proof to save space. The argument relies on the
complementarity of the shapes of C and C ⊥ , and determining
the ranks of the codes involved from the shape data, see [7].

(C : r) = {e ∈ (R2n ) | re ∈ C}.

Lemma 14. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring, γ an
element of R generating the Jacobson radical J of R, and ν
the smallest positive integer such that J ν = {0}. Let C be an
⊥
R-submodule of R2n . Then (C : γ ν−i−1 ) = (C ⊥ : γ i ) holds
for all i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ ν − 1.

Let R be a ﬁnite chain ring whose Jacobson radical J is
generated by γ. Let ν denote the nilpotency index of J, that
is J ν = 0 and J ν−1 = 0. Consider the submodule quotient
(C : γ). We can form the chain of submodule quotients:

Proof: Let u = (a|b) be an arbitrary element of (C ⊥ :
γ ). It follows from the deﬁnition of a submodule quotient
that rγ i u = (rγ i a|rγ i b) ∈ C ⊥ holds for all r in R. For any
element v = (c|d) in the submodule quotient (C : γ ν−i−1 ),
we have γ ν−i−1 v ∈ C. Therefore,

C ⊆ (C : γ) ⊆ . . . ⊆ (C : γ ν−1 ).

i

We denote by C the image of C under reduction modulo J(R).
This chain of codes and their reductions modulo J(R) will
allow us to compare stabilizer code over rings with stabilizer
codes over ﬁelds.

belongs to the kernel of χ. In other words, γ ν−1 (a.d − b.c)
is in the kernel of all characters χb with b ∈ R, hence in the
kernel of all irreducible characters, so it must be 0. By [5,
Corollary 2.3], it follows that a.d − b.c must be a multiple of
γ, so it is in the Jacobson radical J(R). Therefore, we can
conclude
(C ⊥ : γ i ) ⊥ (C : γ ν−i−1 ).

Theorem 16. Let R be a ﬁnite commutative chain ring. If
an (n, K, d)R free stabilizer code exists over the ring, then a
corresponding (n, K, ≥ d) stabilizer code exists over the ﬁeld
R/J(R) with equality achieved in the case of pure codes.
Proof: Since C ⊥ is a free code, C is also a free code. A
free code satisﬁes the property that C γ i Rn = γ i C. Hence
we have (C : γ i ) = C f or i = 0, ..., v − 1. This implies
that (C ⊥ − (C : α) = (C ⊥ − C). Hence d((C ⊥ − (C : α)) =
d((C ⊥ − C)). By Proposition 15, we have d(C ⊥ − C) ≤
d(C ⊥ − C) since the codes are free. The parameters n and K
remain preserved when the free code is projected onto the ﬁeld.
Therefore, the ﬁrst part of the claim follows from Theorem 7.
We claim that the minimum distance is preserved for pure
codes. Indeed, in the case of pure codes we have d(C ⊥ ) =
d(C ⊥ − C). Since C ⊥ −C ⊆ C ⊥ , we have d(C ⊥ ) ≤ d(C ⊥ −
C). From the properties of free codes we can write d(C ⊥ ) =
d(C ⊥ ). Therefore, d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d(C ⊥ − C), and we can
conclude that d(C ⊥ − C) = d(C ⊥ − C).

The claim follows, since dim (C ⊥ : γ i )+dim (C : γ ν−i−1 ) =
2n by Lemma 13.
Having established the orthogonality of the submodule
quotients, we are now ready to give a comparison of the
minimum distances of the quantum codes over these rings
to that over the ﬁnite ﬁelds. Recall that the weight of the
error X(a)Z(b) is characterized by the symplectic weight of
the corresponding vector (a|b). Also the minimum distance
of the stabilizer code equals swt(C ⊥ − C). Let us denote
d(C ⊥ − C) to be the minimum of all the swt(a|b) where
(a|b) ∈ (C ⊥ − C). Thus we are interested in estimating the
d(C ⊥ − C) as this yields the distance of the stabilizer code
over the ring.

VII. C ONCLUSION
We established the existence of stabilizer codes over Frobenius rings. In particular, we related quantum codes over rings
to classical codes. This allowed us to give the ﬁrst systematic
construction of quantum codes over rings. Subsequently, we
studied the structure of stabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain rings.
By developing the structure theory of modules over ﬁnite
chain rings, we were able to obtain numerous structural results
on stabilizer codes over ﬁnite chain rings. In particular, we
established that the minimum distance of stabilizer codes
corresponding to free codes over ﬁnite chain rings cannot
exceed the minimum distance of stabilizer codes over ﬁnite
ﬁeld.

Proposition 15. Let R be a ﬁnite local principal ideal ring,
γ an element of R generating the Jacobson radical J of R,
and ν the smallest positive integer such that J ν = {0}. Let
C be an R-submodule of R2n satisfying C ≤ C ⊥ , that is, C
is a self-orthogonal linear code over the ring R. Then
d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d((C ⊥ − (C : α))
where α = γ ν−1 .
Proof: Let C ⊥ − (C : α) = {x|x ∈ C ⊥ and αx ∈ C}.
/
Let us consider an element x ∈ C ⊥ − (C : α), then αx ∈
C ⊥ − C. This implies that α(C ⊥ − (C : α)) ⊂ C ⊥ − C.
Therefore we have d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d(α(C ⊥ − (C : α))).
From the above we have d(C ⊥ −C) ≤ d(α(C ⊥ −(C : α))).
Since R is a ﬁnite local ring with Jacobson radical J, its
quotient ring F = R/J is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. We can deﬁne a map
ψ : αR2n → F 2n by

ψ((αr1 , . . . , αr2n )) = (r1 + J, . . . , r2n + J).
Since the annihilator of α in R is given by J, this is a welldeﬁned homomorphisms of R-modules. Since ψ is surjective
and ker ψ = {0}, it follows that ψ is an isomorphism.
We have ψ(α((C ⊥ − (C : α)) = (C ⊥ − (C : α)). Since
swt(αc) = swt ψ(αc)) = swt(c), we have
d(C ⊥ − C) ≤ d(α(C ⊥ − (C : α))) = d((C ⊥ − (C : α).
Therefore, we can conclude that d(C ⊥ − C)
≤
d((C ⊥ − (C : α), as claimed.
The above bounds on the minimum distance have been
established using the classical objects. However in order to
generalize the comparison to stabilizer codes, we need the
code over the ﬁeld also to be self orthogonal. This is possible
when the projected code over the ﬁeld contains its dual, which
is the case for free codes.
