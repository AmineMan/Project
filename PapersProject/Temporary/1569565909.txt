of the cooperation schemes for the point-to-point communication link have been presented from an information-theoretic
viewpoint in [1], [2].
With the growing popularity of mobile multimedia applications, the importance of investigating cooperation for a multicast/broadcast setting can not be over-emphasized. Several recent works have focused on the cooperative multicast problem
(see [4] and references therein). More recently, a cooperative
wireless multicast setting was investigated in [5] using the
traditional two-hop multicast scheme with ﬁxed-rate codes.
As opposed to the ﬁxed-rate cooperation of [5], we propose
a cooperation strategy based on rateless coding, due to which
the users can decode adaptively and forward the information
the moment decoding is successful. In addition, we present a
hybrid relaying strategy which uses a combination of AF and
DF, thus making sure that users start relaying even if they have
not decoded the source message – we call it the ADF strategy.
We employ the bucket-ﬁlling approach of [6] for performance
evaluation in terms of the outage behavior. Simulation results
indicate the superiority of our hybrid approach over individual
rateless coded AF and DF schemes, as well as the ﬁxed-rate
two-hop scheme of [5].

Abstract—We consider a cooperative wireless multicast channel
with no channel state information available at the transmitters,
and where all wireless links undergo independent identically
distributed quasi-static Rayleigh fading. For cooperation, we
propose a rateless coded approach and identify its beneﬁts over a
conventional ﬁxed-rate two-hop strategy. In addition to providing
robust communications under fading conditions, rateless coding
is able to exploit the cooperation beneﬁts to a greater degree.
A hybrid rateless coded cooperation scheme is proposed which
employs amplify-and-forward (AF) in conjunction with decodeand-forward (DF) strategy. Results based on Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that the rateless coded hybrid scheme is able
to signiﬁcantly outperform two-hop cooperation, as well as the
individual AF and DF strategies.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication has
in recent years emerged as the technology of choice for
combating the effects of multipath fading, shadowing, and
interference in wireless networks. However, the shrinking size
of mobile devices poses a serious threat to the viability of this
technique. Alternatively, spatio-temporal diversity can also be
exploited using cooperative communications [1]. In a cooperative communication system, dedicated relays are introduced
which receive, process and forward the source message to
the destination nodes. Alternatively, the network nodes might
cooperate amongst themselves while sending and/or receiving
information. This cooperative diversity offers advantages over
traditional wireless networks in terms of an increased throughput and/or a higher reliability. It also provides the multiplexing
and diversity gains which are typically associated with multiantenna communications [2].
In order to exploit spatial diversity in wireless networks,
various cooperation protocols have been proposed (see [3]
and references therein). These protocols can generally be
divided into three categories, namely, Decode-and-Forward
(DF), Amplify-and-Forward (AF), and Compress-and-Forward
(CF). In DF, a cooperating node attempts to decode the information from a source before re-encoding it and forwarding to
the destination. On the other hand, in AF and CF strategies, the
nodes need not decode the source information to cooperate.
In AF, the nodes simply amplify and forward the received
analog signal, whereas in CF, the nodes quantize the received
information before compressing the quantization indices and
forwarding to the destination. Detailed comparative analyses

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a Gaussian multicast channel consisting of a
base-station (source) and a cluster of N users, where all the
users need the same message from the source. All the users
as well as the base-station are assumed to employ a single
receive/transmit antenna. Let ci be the complex channel gain
between the base-station and user i, i = 1, . . . , N , and cij be
the complex channel gain between user i and j, with cij = cji .
All links are assumed to experience independent identically
distributed (i.i.d) block ﬂat Rayleigh fading with E[|cij |2 ] = 1
and E[|ci |2 ] = 1/ξ where ξ ≥ 1 accommodates the fact
that the source-user links may experience a greater path loss
compared with the inter-user links (possibly because the interuser distances may be smaller compared to the source-to-user
distances). It is assumed that nodes have no channel state
information (CSI) except as required for decoding. Let X[n]
and Xi [n] be the transmitted signal from the base-station and
user i at time n, respectively. The received signal Yi [n] at user

1

i is then given by

On the other hand, the outage rate for a given outage probability p can be determined from (3) as

N

Yi [n] = ci X[n] +

cij Xj [n] + Zi [n]

Ro (p, SNRt ) = log2 1 −

j=1,j=i

where Zi [n] denotes the zero-mean, additive i.i.d circularly
symmetric complex Gaussian noise. Without loss in generality,
we assume that the noise is of unit variance. In addition, we
assume that the source as well as all the users employ the
same average transmit power P , and therefore have the same
average transmit signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. SNRs = SNRu =
SNR = P . The total system signal-to-noise ratio is then given
as SNRt = (N + 1)SNR. For evaluating the performance of
the proposed cooperation strategies, we consider the outage
behavior at the individual users. A user declares an outage if
it is not able to decode at the target rate R. Let Ri (c, SNR) be
the achievable rate at user i as a function of the SNR and the
set c of all channel gains. The outage probability pi (R, SNR)
at user i is then deﬁned as the probability that the achievable
rate Ri (c, SNR) is less than the target rate R. Another outage
measure we will employ is the outage rate. The outage rate
at user i for a given outage probability p is deﬁned as the
maximum rate at which the base-station could transmit such
that the user is able to decode it with an outage probability
not exceeding p. Mathematically,
o
Ri (p, SNR) = max R Pr (Ri (c, SNR) < R) ≤ p

An upper bound on the achievable rate at a given user can
be obtained using the cut-set arguments [7]. This upper bound
for user 1 is given as

The outage probability and the outage rate corresponding to
the upper bound can be evaluated numerically.
C. Rateless coded Cooperation
Most works on cooperative wireless multicast (see [5] and
references therein) consider the ﬁxed-rate two-hop DF relaying
strategy in which the base-station broadcasts in the ﬁrst stage
using ﬁxed-rate codes while the users attempt to decode the
source message. In the second stage, only those users which
have decoded the message correctly in the ﬁrst stage are
allowed to relay, while the base-station and remaining users
remain silent. We argue that this scheme fails to enhance
user cooperation due to its non-adaptive nature. The biggest
drawback is that only those users are allowed to relay who
successfully decode the source message at the end of the ﬁrst
stage. This effectively bars all the remaining users from cooperating even though they could possibly decode the message in
the second stage. Similarly, the successful users have to wait
till the start of the second stage before they could participate in
relaying. As opposed to the ﬁxed-rate two-hop scheme of [5],
we propose a cooperative multicast scheme which incorporates
rateless coding at all the nodes. It can leverage the cooperative
advantages as the users decode adaptively and are allowed to
start relaying/cooperating as soon as they succeed in decoding.
In addition, rateless codes can adapt to channel variations and
thus provide reliable yet efﬁcient communication. We now
present the proposed rateless-coded relaying strategies.
1) DF Cooperation: We ﬁrst explain the rateless-coded
DF scheme. In this scheme, the base-station broadcasts the
message using rateless codes with a signal-to-noise ratio
SNRs , while the users try to decode the source message. Let
D be the set of users to have decoded the message at any given
time while Dc be {1, ..., N }/D, where / implies subtraction.
If a user succeeds in decoding the source message, it stops
listening and starts forwarding the decoded information using
SNRu . It is further assumed that the base-station as well as
the users transmit from independent rateless codebooks.

(1)

In non-cooperative multicast, the users do not transmit. The
achievable rate at user i is simply given as
(2)

where we have assumed that the base-station uses all available
system power. This ensures a fair comparison of cooperative
and non-cooperative multicast since both employ the same
system power. Since |ci |2 follows an exponential distribution,
the outage probability for a given target rate R is given as

For outage detection, we use the bucket ﬁlling approach of
[6] where each user is assigned an information bucket of
unit volume. A full information bucket indicates that the user
is capable of decoding the source message. If the users are
subjected to a peak power constraint, the information bucket
ﬁll-rate for user i ∈ Dc can be expressed as


Fi(DF ) = log2 1 + |ci |2 SNRs +

|cij |2 SNRu 

the received symbols while simultaneously trying to decode
the source message. When a user succeeds in decoding the
source message, it stops amplifying and starts forwarding the
decoded version using a rateless code.1 Meanwhile, the basestation also continues to transmit using an independent rateless
code. It is assumed that the base-station transmits until either
all the users have decoded the message, or a certain maximum
time is elapsed. We propose two different ADF strategies
which are described below in detail.
Multi-Slot ADF (ADF-MS): In multi-slot ADF, the total
available bandwidth is initially divided into N+1 orthogonal
bands(slots) of equal width – one for the base-station and one
for each of the N users. In order to improve the spectral
efﬁciency, the users/base-station are allowed to redistribute
their bandwidth such that there are |Dc | + 1 orthogonal bands
at any given time: The base-station and the users belonging to
the set D transmit in the same band (we call it the source
band) from independent rateless codebooks while each of
the remaining users (belonging to the set Dc ) employ their
respective bands to amplify and forward what they receive
in the source band. It should be noted that each user listens
to the transmission in all the bands except the one in which
it transmits – thus ADF-MS is half-duplex. The signal Yis
received in the source band at user i is given as

(6)

j∈D

However, in case of an energy or an average power constraint at the individual users, the modiﬁed ﬁll-rate expression
is given as



|cij | SNRu 
(7)
Fi(DF ) = log2 1 + |ci |2 SNRs +
1 − Rtd [j]
j∈D

where td [j] is the normalized time at which user j ∈ D
decodes its message and R is the target rate. As a user
does not transmit till it decodes, the normalization factor
(1 − Rtd [j]) ensures that it consumes all of its available
energy in relaying. We refer to the DF schemes corresponding
to (6) and (7) as (un-normalized) DF, and normalized DF,
respectively. As opposed to normalized DF where each user
is allowed to use a scaled transmit power P/(1 − Rtd [i]])
while relaying, un-normalized DF requires all the users to
relay with a transmit power not greater than P , regardless
of the time at which they decode the source message. It
can be veriﬁed that if SNRu = 0, and SNRs = SNRt , both
(6) and (7) degenerate to the ﬁll-rates corresponding to the
direct non-cooperative multicast case. We now describe the
bucket-ﬁlling algorithm that we use for outage detection:

Similar to the previous scheme, we can use the bucket-ﬁlling
algorithm to detect outages for ADF-MS. In order to obtain the
expression for the ﬁll-rate, we represent the signals received
at a user i∈ Dc in matrix form as:

Using Monte-Carlo simulations, this outage-detection
algorithm can be used to calculate the outage probability, as
well as the outage rate.
2) Hybrid ADF Cooperation: In DF, users start to cooperate only after they have decoded the source message. However,
it is possible to have further improvement in performance if the
users yet to decode also participate in relaying. With this motivation, we propose a hybrid Amplify/Decode-and-Forward
(ADF) relaying strategy in which AF is used in conjunction
with DF. In ADF, the users transmit the ampliﬁed versions of

Yi = H i X + Zi

where the vector Y consists of the received signal in each of
the (|Dc | + 1) receiving bands at user i, with each signal component scaled by the standard deviation of the corresponding

The vector X = [Xs , · · · , Xj , · · · ]T ∀j ∈ D is a collection b/s/Hz and ξ = 5. It can be observed that cooperative schemes
of the signals being transmitted from the source and the users provide an appreciable gain in performance compared to the

the rateless coded hybrid ADF cooperation outperforms the
individual AF2 and DF schemes. For instance, at an outage
probability of p = 0.02, ADF-MS outperforms rateless coded
AF and normalized DF cooperation by approximately 1.3 and

users continue to relay using AF even if they have decoded the message.

2.5 dB, respectively. Moreover, the performance gap between
ADF and rateless-coded DF cooperation increases further (by
approximately 0.3 dB at p = 0.02) if we impose a peak power
constraint at individual users. This is because un-normalized
DF fails to consume the total available energy at the nodes
and performs worse than the normalized DF scheme.
For a ﬁxed outage probability p=0.02, Fig. 2 shows the outage
rate plotted against the system energy per bit Eb = (N +1)SNR
Ro (p,SNR)
for N =10 users and ξ = 5. It is evident that the ADF schemes
provide signiﬁcant reduction in the required Eb compared
to individual AF and DF strategies as well as the two-hop
scheme, specially in the low-power/low-rate regime. For example, with ADF-MS, the energy per bit required to achieve an
outage rate of 0.05 b/s/Hz is 1.6, 2.8 and 3.4 dB less than that
required by rateless coded AF, rateless coded normalized DF
cooperation, and two-hop DF cooperation, respectively. Thus
the proposed cooperation strategies are of particular interest
in applications such as wireless sensor networks where nodes
have limited energy resources and/or the required spectral
efﬁciencies are low. It can also be seen that at relatively higher
rates, ADF-DS performs better than ADF-MS. This makes
intuitive sense since in ADF-DS the total bandwidth is divided
into only two equal slots, as opposed to (Dc +1) slots in ADFMS which plays a role in decreasing the spectral efﬁciency
of ADF-MS over ADF-DS at relatively higher signal-to-noise
ratios. Also, the curves for AF and both the ADF schemes
exhibit a dipping behavior (near the axis) indicating that the
minimum value of Eb is achieved for a non-zero spectral
efﬁciency. This is consistent with the results in [10] in which a
similar behavior was observed for AF cooperation in a threenode relay network under an ergodic rate setting.
Figs. 3 and 4 show similar results for ξ = 2 where
the performance of rateless coded AF degrades compared to
normalized DF. However, the hybrid ADF still outperforms its
nearest competitor by a handsome margin. For example, it can
be seen from Fig. 3 that the performance gap between ADFMS and normalized DF is approximately 1.42 dB at p = 0.02.
Similarly, in Fig. 4 ADF-MS outperforms normalized DF by
1.35 dB at an outage rate of 0.05 b/s/Hz.

V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we explored an i.i.d fading cooperative multicast channel employing rateless coding at each node. We
proposed a hybrid ADF cooperation that uses amplify-forward
in conjunction with decode-forward cooperation. Using outage
probability and outage rate as performance measures, the proposed hybrid scheme was shown to signiﬁcantly outperform
the individual ratless-coded AF and DF schemes, as well as
the ﬁxed-rate two-hop relaying strategy.
