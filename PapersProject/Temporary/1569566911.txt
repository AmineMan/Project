To avoid the total loss of packets in case of collision in
the slotted ALOHA system, Medard et al. in [7] considered
a random access channel and developed a layered coding
scheme. Their coding scheme is opportunistic in the sense
that as the number of active users decreases, the number of
layers which can be decoded at the receiver increases.

Abstract—A random access interference channel in which
transmitters are active with a certain probability is considered.
By adopting the deterministic channel model, the optimum
transmission strategy which yields the maximum achievable
expected sum-rate, or channel throughput, is characterized for
the symmetric case. The optimal transmission strategy achieves
the sum-capacity of the deterministic interference channel when
both users are active, and opportunistically increases the expected
sum-rate when transmitters may not always be active.

Recently, Minero, Franceschetti and Tse [8] also studied
the random access MAC from an information-theoretic perspective. They assumed that each user in the MAC is active
with probability p which is assumed to be known at all
transmitters. Using a multilayer coding scheme, they showed
that to obtain the throughput of the system, each user should
opportunistically adjust its transmission strategy based on the
value of p. In speciﬁc, in order to obtain the throughput of the
system, each transmitter only requires to employ two different
transmission strategies corresponding to the cases of p ≤ 1/2
and p > 1/2.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Sharing a common medium among several unicast connections is the main source of interference in wireless communication. There are different ways to manage the interference
including avoiding it through time or frequency multiplexing,
treating other transmitters’ interference as noise, or decoding
the interference. Finding the optimal way to manage the
interference has been a focus of research for the past few
decades. Even for the simplest case of the two-user Gaussian
interference channel (IC), the optimal interference management method is still out of reach. Speciﬁcally, the capacity
region of the two-user IC is only known when the interference
is strong [1]. For all other cases, the best achievable result
is due to Han and Kobayashi [2]. By using a simple HanKobayashi scheme, Etkin et al. [3] characterized the capacity
region of IC to within 1 bit/s/Hz.
To make progress, Avestimehr et al. [4] introduced a deterministic channel model to simplify the analysis of interference
in multi-user wireless networks. This approximate model is
simple to analyse, and at the same time is powerful enough
to predict the behaviour of many multi-user channels including multiple access channel (MAC), broadcast channel, relay
channel and so on. As an example, Bresler and Tse [5] showed
that this model can provide the capacity region of the two-user
Gaussian IC to within constant bits.
In a wireless network, it is usually assumed that transmitters
always have data to send. However, in a more realistic model,
one needs to consider the randomness of message arrivals
at transmitters. The ﬂexibility of ALOHA [6] makes it the
ﬁrst option used in wireless networks with random message
arrivals. In ALOHA systems, if a collision occurs, receiver
totally discards the sent packets.

In this paper, a two-user interference channel with random
access is investigated. As the ﬁrst step, a symmetric binary
deterministic interference channel with crossover parameter
α in which each transmitter is active with probability p is
considered. Using the machinery developed in [8], it is shown
that in order to achieve the throughput of the channel, each
transmitter needs to change its transmission strategy based
on the pair (p, α). Speciﬁcally, the decision region of each
transmitter, D = {0 ≤ p ≤ 1, α > 0}, is divided into six subregions, and for each sub-region, a transmission strategy that
maximizes the expected sum-rate of the system is proposed.
This paper is organized as follows: section II deﬁnes the
system model and notations used throughout the paper. Section
III presents two theorems which are the main results of this
paper. The ﬁrst theorem characterizes the capacity region of
the system, and the second theorem determines the channel
throughput for all values of channel parameters. The converse
part of the ﬁrst theorem is proved in section IV, and section
V is the proof of the achievability part. Finally, conclusions
and direction for further research are presented in section VI.
Throughout this paper, all vectors are assumed to be column
vectors, X[a : b] is a vector which includes elements of vector
X from ath to bth position, and X[a : b, c : d] is a concatenation
of X[a : b] and X[c : d].

where the maximization is over all the rate quadruples
r1 ({1}), r1 ({1, 2}), r2 ({2}), r2 ({1, 2}) .
To ﬁnd the channel throughput, the region of rate quadruples
r1 ({1}), r1 ({1, 2}), r2 ({2}), r2 ({1, 2}) needs to be characterized. To characterize this region, we require to model
different channel states. To this aim, a network with two
interfering broadcast channels is used. This network depicted
in Fig. 1 has two transmitters and four receivers, and models
all states of the channel. In this network, RxP2P , i ∈ {1, 2}, are
i
used to model the channel state in which only the transmitter
i is active, and Rx1 , Rx2 are used to model the channel state
in which both transmitters are active.
As the ﬁrst step to analyse RAIC, the binary deterministic
channel is used to model the point-to-point channels as well
as the interference channel. The resulted network is called
binary deterministic - random access interference channel
(BD-RAIC). It is clear that if a message can be decoded
by Rxi , it can also be decoded at RxP2P . So, without loss of
i
generality, it is assumed that

In a two-user random access interference channel (RAIC),
it is assumed that both transmitters have two states which are
called active and inactive. In each transmission, the active
transmitter sends a codeword to its intended receiver while
the inactive transmitter remains silent. The receivers know the
state of both transmitters while each transmitter only knows
its own state, and the state of transmitters does not change
during each transmission. The transmitters’ states in each time
slot are independent from each other. Furthermore, the states
of each transmitter during different time slots are assumed to
be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). When both
transmitters are active, each transmitter communicates with its
corresponding receiver through an interference channel, and
when only one transmitter is active, the active transmitter is
connected to its intended receiver via a point-to-point channel.

where Wi,j are independent messages and uniformly distributed over a set with cardinality 2nRi,j , i ∈ {1, 2} and
j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , |Wi |}. Also, let Wi {A} ⊆ Wi denote the
set of those messages of Txi which can be reliably decoded
at Rxi when set A ⊆ {1, 2} of transmitters are active, and
ri (A) denote the sum-rate of the messages in Wi (A). Note
that transmitters are not aware of each other’s state and
consequently the set A. Hence, each transmitter uses the same

the messages in the set Wi {1, 2} with vanishing probability of
error. Let CW be the set of all achievable rate quadruples for
the message structure W. Note that depending on the values
of |W1 | and |W2 |, we have many possible message structures
for a given channel. For each message structure, we can deﬁne
CW . The capacity region of the channel in Fig. 1 is deﬁned as

probability p, the maximum expected sum-rate happens in
one of the corner points. The corner points can be found by
using linear programming methods, and in order to ﬁnd the
maximum expected sum-rate, it is sufﬁcient to compute and
compare the expected sum-rate in corner points. This ends in
(17). In Fig. 2, the corner points achieving the throughput in
different regions of (p, α) are presented.
In Theorem 2, the system throughput is compared by
2np which is the throughput of the system including two
independent channels in which transmitters are active with
probability p, and capacity of each channel is n bits. In Fig.
TP
3, 2np is depicted in terms of α for different p and different
transmission strategies. In ALOHA strategy, each transmitter
ignores the presence of other transmitter, so the Throughput
is 2np(1 − p). In IC strategy, each transmitter assumes that
the other transmitter is always active, so TP is equal to the
p
sum-capacity of the binary deterministic interference channel.

B. Discussion
In this part, we explain some implications of Theorem 2.
Recall that the only parameters that a transmitter can base its
transmission strategy on, are (p, α). According to Theorem 2,
in order to achieve the channel throughput each transmitter
needs to divide its decision region in (p, α) plane into six
sub-regions as depicted in Fig. 2. In each sub-region of Fig.
IC
RA
IC
RA
2, the rate quadruple (R1 , R1 , R2 , R2 ) which achieves
the channel throughput in that sub-region is provided. The
following observations can be made from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3:
• In the very strong interference regime (α > 2), there is no
possibility for opportunistic transmission regardless of p. This
is predictable because the very strong interference is equivalent
to no interference [1].
• When 2/3 < α < 2 and p > 1/2, a conservative strategy,
IC strategy, in which each transmitter adjusts its transmission
strategy based on the activeness of both users yields the
channel throughput.
• For all the remaining cases, the opportunistic transmission
provides a throughput gain compare to the other strategies.
• The ALOHA strategy in which each transmitter ignores the
existence of the other transmitter is always suboptimal in the
sense of channel throughput.

(22) and (23) are direct results of the channel model and

deterministic interference channel which have been previously
proved in [5] and [9]. To prove other bounds, we deﬁne

(34)

We used a binary deterministic model to analyse the random access interference channel. For the symmetric case, we
proved that a coding scheme which splits the rate among
three messages can achieve the throughput of the channel.
In this coding scheme, two messages are always decoded
while the third one is opportunistically decoded when only
one transmitter is active. Extending this work to the Gaussian
channel model is the focus of another research paper.

The proof of achievability of (R1 , R1 , R2 , R2 )
is equivalent to the proof of achievability of
r1 ({1}), r1 ({1, 2}), r2 ({2}), r2 ({1, 2}) ,
because
they
are linearly related. To show that the region stated in
Theorem 1 is achievable, we need to show that its corner
points are achievable. The number of corner points of the
region C depends on α. A corner point T1 is said to be
dominated by a corner point T2 , if each coordinate of T1
is less than or equal to the corresponding coordinate of
T2 . The achievability proof is consequently reduced to the
achievability of dominant corner points. Due to the space
limitation, we prove the achievability of a dominant corner
point for 0 < α < 2 in the following. For the complete
achievability scheme please refer to the full version of this
paper [10].
