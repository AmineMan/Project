results in suboptimal end-to-end performance of analog network coding, as we establish in this paper and was also previously indicated in [5], [6]. Further, even in low-SNR regimes
amplify-and-forward relaying can be capacity achieving relay
strategy in some scenarios, [7]. Therefore, in this paper we are
concerned with analyzing the performance of analog network
coding in layered networks, without above two assumptions on
input signal scaling factors and received SNRs. Computing the
maximum rate achievable with analog network coding without
these two assumptions, however, results in a computationally
intractable problem, in general [4], [6].
Our main contribution is a result that a globally optimal set
of scaling factors for the nodes that maximizes the end-to-end
rate in a general layered relay network can be computed layerby-layer. In particular, a rate-optimal set of scaling factors for
the nodes in a layer is the one that maximizes the sum-rate
of the nodes in the next layer. This result allows us to exactly
compute the optimal end-to-end rate achievable with analog
network coding, over all possible choices of scaling factors
for the nodes, in a class of layered networks that cannot be
so addressed using existing approaches. We illustrate this by
computing the maximum ANC rate in different scenarios for
one particular layered network. Further, for general layered
relay networks, our result signiﬁcantly reduces the computational complexity of solving this problem.
In this paper, we provide the summary of our work. We have
omitted most proofs or give only brief outlines. The details can
be found in our arXiv submission [8].
Organization: In Section II we introduce a general wireless
layered relay network model and formulate the problem of
maximum rate achievable with ANC in such a network. Section III discusses the computational hardness of this problem
and existing approaches to address it. In Section IV we ﬁrst
motivate and then state and prove the key lemma of this
paper that allows us to compute a rate-optimal set of scaling
factors for the nodes in a layered network in a layer-bylayer manner. Then Section V illustrates the computation of
the maximum ANC rate in one particular layered network in
various scenarios. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

Abstract—The problem of maximum rate achievable with
analog network coding for a unicast communication over a
layered wireless relay network with directed links is considered.
A relay node performing analog network coding scales and
forwards the signals received at its input. Recently this problem
has been considered under two assumptions: (A) each relay node
scales its received signal to the upper bound of its transmit power
constraint, (B) the relay nodes in speciﬁc subsets of the network
operate in the high-SNR regime. We establish that assumption
(A), in general, leads to suboptimal end-to-end rate. We also
characterize the performance of analog network coding in a class
of symmetric layered networks without assumption (B).
The key contribution of this work is a lemma that states that in
a layered relay network a globally optimal set of scaling factors
for the nodes that maximizes the end-to-end rate can be computed
layer-by-layer. Speciﬁcally, a rate-optimal set of scaling factors
for the nodes in a layer is the one that maximizes the sum-rate
of the nodes in the next layer. This critical insight allows us
to characterize analog network coding performance in network
scenarios beyond those that can be analyzed using the existing
approaches. We illustrate this by computing the maximum rate
achievable with analog network coding in one particular layered
network, in various communication scenarios.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Analog network coding (ANC) extends to multihop wireless
networks the idea of linear network coding [1] where an intermediate node sends out a linear combination of its incoming
packets. In a wireless network, signals transmitted simultaneously by multiple sources add in the air. Each node receives
a noisy sum of these signals, i.e. a linear combination of the
received signals and noise. A multihop relay scheme where
an intermediate relay node merely ampliﬁes and forwards this
noisy sum is referred to as analog network coding [2], [3].
The performance of the analog network coding in layered
relay networks is previously analyzed in [3], [4]. In [3],
the achievable rate is computed under two assumptions: (A)
each relay node scales the received signal to the maximum
extent possible subject to its transmit power constraint, (B)
the nodes in all layers operate in the high-SNR regime,
where the received signal power PR,k at the k th node satisﬁes
mink∈l PR,k ≥ 1/δ, l = 1, . . . , L for some small δ ≥ 0, where
L is the number of layers of relay nodes. It is shown that the
rate achieved under these two assumptions approaches network
capacity as the source power increases. The authors in [4]
extend this work to the scenarios where the nodes in at most
one layer do not satisfy these two assumptions and show that
achievable rates in such scenarios also approach the network
capacity as the source power increases.
However, requiring each relay node to amplify its received
signal to the upper bound of its transmit power constraint

Consider a (L + 2)-layer wireless relay network with directed links1 . Source s is at layer ‘0’, destination t is at
layer ‘L + 1’, and a set R of relay nodes are arranged in
L layers between them. The lth layer contains nl relay nodes,

signal subtraction notion we introduced in [6]. However, for the ease of
presentation we do not discuss such networks in this paper.

III. A NALYZING THE OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE OF ANALOG
NETWORK CODING IN GENERAL LAYERED NETWORKS

The problem (11) is a hard optimization problem. In terms
of Geometric Programming [10], [11], SN Rt is a ratio of
posynomials that is a nonlinear (neither convex nor concave)
function of l nl variables in β, in general. It is well-known
that maximizing such ratios of posynomials is an intractable
problem with no efﬁcient and global solution methods [10,
Page 85]. However, globally optimal solutions of such problems can be approximated using heuristic methods based on
signomial programming condensation that solves a sequence
of geometric programs, as in [10, Section 3.3]. Such heuristics
though useful in providing good numerical approximations to
the optimal SN Rt , do not provide non-trivial characterization
of the optimal SN Rt (or a βopt that achieves it) in terms of
various system parameters. We argue that such characterization
however, is highly desired not only for the accurate analysis
of ANC performance in general layered networks, but also for
various reasons of signiﬁcant practical consequences, [8].

where Ks is the set of L-tuples of node indices corresponding
to all paths from source s to destination t with path delay L.
Similarly, Klj is the set of L − l + 1-tuples of node indices
corresponding to all paths from the j th relay of lth layer to
destination t with path delay L − l + 1.
For all the paths between source s and destination t, and all
the paths between the j th relay of the lth layer to destination
t with path delay L − l + 1, we introduce modiﬁed channel
gains, respectively, as follows

The maximum information-rate IAN C (Ps ) achievable in a

where SN Rt , the signal-to-noise ratio at destination t is:

where PR,i is the received power at the node i.
In layered networks, all copies of a source signal and a noise
symbol introduced at a node and traveling along different paths
arrive at the destination with the same respective time delays.
Therefore, the outputs of the source-destination channel are
free of intersymbol interference. This simpliﬁes the relation
between input and output of the channel and allows us to omit
the time-index while denoting the input and output signals.
Using (1) and (3), the input-output channel between the
source and destination can be written as
yt =

In [8] we provide an example to illustrate the derivation
of the source-destination channel expression in (7) for a
speciﬁc layered network in terms of the modiﬁed channel gains
introduced above.
Problem Formulation: For a given network-wide scaling
vector β = (βli )1≤l≤L,1≤i≤nl , the achievable rate for the
channel in (7) with i.i.d. Gaussian input is ([3], [4], [6]):

In analog network coding each relay node ampliﬁes and
forwards the noisy signal sum received at its input. More
precisely, a relay node i at instant n + 1 transmits the scaled
version of yi [n], its input at time instant n, as follows
xi [n + 1] = βi yi [n],

hlj zlj + zt
l=1 j=1

where xj [n] is the channel input of the node j in the neighbor
set N (i) of node i. In (1), hji is a real number representing
the channel gain along the link from node j to node i. It is
assumed to be ﬁxed (for example, as in a single realization of a
fading process) and known throughout the network. The source
symbols xs [n], −∞ < n < ∞, are i.i.d. Gaussian random
variables with zero mean and variance Ps that satisfy an
average source power constraint, xs [n] ∼ N (0, Ps ). Further,
{zi [n]} is a sequence (in n) of i.i.d. Gaussian random variables
with zi [n] ∼ N (0, σ 2 ). We also assume that zi are independent
of the input signal and of each other. We assume that the ith
relay’s transmit power is constrained as:

Towards this goal, in [3], [4] the performance of analog
network coding is analyzed under assumptions A and B
discussed earlier about per node scaling factor and received
SNR at each node, respectively. In the following, we provide
an example to establish that assumption A, in general, leads
to suboptimal ANC rates.
Example 1: Let us consider the 2-relay Gaussian diamond
network, [3], [5]. It is deﬁned as a directed graph G = (V, E)
with V = {s, t, 1, 2} and E = {(s, 1), (s, 2), (1, t), (2, t)}. Let
he be the channel gain along the link e, e ∈ E. The problem
of maximum rate achievable with analog network coding for
this network can be formulated as (using (11)), [8]:

that for a given (β1 , . . . , βL−1 ), SN Rt increases with βL .
However, as the maximum value that βL can take is βL,max ,
so SN Rt attains it maximum value at βL,max .
Step 2: Using (15) we can express SN Rt only in terms of
(β1 , . . . , βL−1 ) as SN Rt (β1 , . . . , βL−1 ) given below as

In a linear AF network, both the source signal and the
noise introduced at each intermediate relay node can reach
the destination along only one path. Therefore using (5), (6),
(7), and (9), for a given scaling vector β, the received SNR
at destination t or any relay node l can be written as

β1,max and β2 < β2,max being satisﬁed lead to a whole class
of scenarios where the global optimum solutions are achieved
when a relay node transmits strictly below its maximum
transmit power constraint, thus contradicting assumption A.
In [6], we provide an instance of such parameter choices.
Next, we introduce our result that allows us to characterize
the optimal performance of analog network coding in general
layered networks without assumption B or its limited relaxation in [4]. This result also provides some key insights into
the nature of βopt in terms of system parameters.

IV. C OMPUTING βopt LAYER - BY- LAYER
In this section we prove that in an end-to-end rate optimal
network-wide scaling vector βopt , the component scaling factors corresponding to the relay nodes in the layer l, 1 ≤ l ≤ L,
maximize the sum-rate of the nodes in the layer l + 1.
However before discussing this result formally, we motivate it
by computing the maximum rate of information transfer over
a linear amplify-and-forward relay network.

It follows from (17) and (18) that SN Rt (β1 , . . . , βL−1 ) and
SN RL are increasing functions of βL−1 . Therefore both attain
their respective maximum at βL−1,max , the maximum value of
βL−1 . In other words, a value of βL−1 that maximizes SN RL
also maximizes SN Rt .
Following the same sequence of steps as in the proof of
above lemma with SN Rt and SN RL replaced by SN RL
and SN RL−1 , respectively, we can also prove that the
same value of βL−2 (speciﬁcally βL−2,max ) maximizes both,
SN RL and SN RL−1 . This along with Lemma 1 that allows us to express both, SN RL and SN Rt as functions
of (β1 , . . . , βL−2 ), proves that the same value of βL−2,max
maximizes SN RL−1 , SN RL and SN Rt . Furthermore carrying out this reasoning recursively allows us to express
SN Ri , 2 ≤ i ≤ L + 1, only in terms of β1 and to prove
that the same value of β1 (speciﬁcally β1,max ) maximizes all
of them. We summarize this in the following proposition.

A. Linear AF Networks
We consider a linear amplify-and-forward network of L
relay nodes between source s and destination t, as shown in
the Figure 1.
Consider a feasible scaling vector β = (β1 , . . . , βL ) such
that the output of each relay node satisﬁes the corresponding
transmit power constraint (2). Then the maximum scaling
factor for the lth , 1 ≤ l ≤ L, relay is (from (3)):

S 2 . Let the noise components at the two nodes be denoted as
N1 and N2 , respectively, with var(N1 ) = var(N2 ) = N 2 .
The SNRs at the nodes in layers k and k + 1 are given as:

We now discuss our result for the general layered networks,
discussed in Section II, in general SNR regime.

Remark 1: Lemma 2, in other words, states that the subvector of the optimal scaling vector βopt corresponding to
the scaling factors of the nodes in the lth layer, is one that
nl+1
maximizes the product i=1 (1 + SN Rl+1,i ) over the nodes
nl+1
in the next layer. However, log i=1 (1 + SN Rl+1,i ) equals
nl+1
i=1 Rl+1,i , the sum of the information rates to the nodes in
the l+1st layer. Therefore an interpretation of the Lemma 2 is:
if starting with the ﬁrst layer, the scaling factors for the nodes
in each successive layer are chosen such that the sum-rate of
the nodes in the next layer is maximized, then such a choice
also leads to a globally optimal solution of the problem (11).
Remark 2: The problem (11) is a hard optimization problem
in l nl variables as noted in Section III. However, Lemma 2
leads to the decomposition of this problem into a cascade of
L such subproblems, where the lth subproblem involves nl
variables. This results in exponential reduction in search space
required to solve (11) in general layered networks.
Proof: For the ease of presentation, we discuss the proof
for a class of layered networks where channel gains along all
links between the nodes in two adjacent layers are equal, as in
Figure 2. We call such layered networks as “Equal Channel
Gains between Adjacent Layers (ECGAL)” networks.

βk−1,2 as SN Rk+1 . Consider the following two problems.

that (βk−1,max , βk−1,max ) is the only solution of both the
problems (20) and (21). Thus proving our claim.
Carrying out the above procedure in the proof of our claim
recursively for all k layers, 1 ≤ k ≤ L, proves the lemma for
the ECGAL networks.

input of the nodes in every layer are identical.

V. I LLUSTRATION
In the following, we illustrate the usefulness of Lemma 2 by
computing the maximum achievable ANC rate in a network
scenario without any a priori assumption on input signal
scaling factors and the received SNRs, as in [3], [4].
Example 2: Consider the ECGAL network of Figure 2 with
L layers of relay nodes between the source and the destination
and N nodes in each layer. We assume all relay nodes have the
same transmit power constraint EX 2 ≤ P . We assume that the
channels gains along all links are equal and denoted as h. From
2
2
the symmetry of the network, it follows that βli,max = βl,max ,
1 ≤ l ≤ L, 1 ≤ i ≤ N , where

as parameter x = Nσ2 P increases. The number of nodes in each layer is
N = 5. We observe that for a given number of layers in the network the
gap approaches a constant value. As the number of layers in the network
increases, the corresponding gap also increases.

Using Lemma 2, we can solve problem (11) for this network.
The solution βopt is such that all relays in a layer use the
same scaling factor and it is equal to the maximum value of
2
2
the scaling factor for the nodes in the layer, i.e. βli = βl,max ,
1 ≤ l ≤ L, 1 ≤ i ≤ N . The corresponding SN Rt is:

ANC rate in a class of symmetric layered network without
these two assumptions. Further, our result signiﬁcantly reduces
the computational complexity of this problem for general
layered networks. We illustrate the signiﬁcance of our result
by computing the maximum ANC rate for one particular relay
network in a scenario that cannot be addressed using existing
approaches. In the future, we plan to extend this work to
general wireless networks.

The received SNR at the lth layer varies with the number of
preceding layers as SN R ∼ (1 + l−1 )−1 . Therefore, for any

ﬁxed δ as in [3], [4], an arbitrarily large number of layers
may violate the high-SNR regime condition mink∈l PR,k ≥
1/δ, l = 1, . . . , L as L grows. Thus the approaches in [3], [4]
cannot be used to exactly compute SN Rt,opt as above or the
optimal ANC rate in such networks.

VI. C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK
We consider the problem of maximum rate achievable with
analog network coding in general layered networks. Previously, this problem was addressed assuming that the nodes
in all but at most one layer in the network are in the highSNR regime, and each node forwards the received signal at
the upper bound of its transmit power constraint. We provide
a key result that allows us to exactly compute the maximum
