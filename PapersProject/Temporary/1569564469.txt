Abstract—1 . We present computationally efﬁcient and provably
correct algorithms with near-optimal sample-complexity for noisy
non-adaptive group testing. Group testing involves grouping arbitrary subsets of items into pools. Each pool is then tested to identify
the defective items, which are usually assumed to be sparsely
distributed. We consider random non-adaptive pooling where pools
are selected randomly and independently of the test outcomes. Our
noisy scenario accounts for both false negatives and false positives
for the test outcomes. Inspired by compressive sensing algorithms
we introduce four novel computationally efﬁcient decoding algorithms for group testing, CBP via Linear Programming (CBP-LP),
NCBP-LP (Noisy CBP-LP), and the two related algorithms NCBPSLP+ and NCBP-SLP- (“Simple” NCBP-LP). The ﬁrst of these
algorithms deals with the noiseless measurement scenario, and the
next three with the noisy measurement scenario. We derive explicit
sample-complexity bounds—with all constants made explicit—for
these algorithms as a function of the desired error probability;
the noise parameters; the number of items; and the size of the
defective set (or an upper bound on it). We show that the samplecomplexities of our algorithms are near-optimal with respect to
known information-theoretic bounds.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The goal of group testing is to identify a small unknown
subset D of defective items embedded in a much larger set N
(usually in the setting where d = |D| is much smaller than
n = |N |, i.e., d is o(n)). This problem was ﬁrst considered by
Dorfman [1] in scenarios where multiple items in a group can
be simultaneously tested, with a binary output depending on
whether or not a “defective” item is present in the group being
tested. In general, the goal of group testing algorithms is to
identify the defective set with as few measurements as possible.
As demonstrated in [1] and later work [2], with judicious
grouping and testing, far fewer than the trivial upper bound
of n tests may be required to identify D.
We consider non-adaptive group testing, where the set of
items being tested in each test is required to be independent
of the outcome of every other test [2]. This restriction is often
useful in practice, since this enables parallelization of the testing
process. We describe computationally efﬁcient algorithms with
near-optimal performance for noiseless and noisy non-adaptive
group testing problems. We describe the different aspects of the
paper in some detail next.

“Noisy” measurements: We also consider the “noisy” variant
of the group testing problem. In this scenario the result of
each test may differ from the true result (in an independent
and identically distributed manner) with a certain pre-speciﬁed
probability q. This leads to both false positives and negatives in
the test outcomes. Much of the existing work either considers
one-sided noise, namely false positives [3] but no false negatives
or a “worst-case” noise [4] wherein the number of false positives
and negatives are assumed bounded.2 Since the measurements
are noisy, the problem of estimating the set of defective items
is more challenging, and is known to require more tests.3 The
work closest to this work is [7], where explicit upper and lower
bounds for the group-testing problem were ﬁrst derived.
Computationally efﬁcient and near-optimal algorithms:
Most algorithms in the literature focus on optimizing the number
of measurements required – in some cases, this leads to algorithms that may not be computationally efﬁcient to implement
(for e.g. [3]). In this paper we present algorithms that are not
only computationally efﬁcient but are also near-optimal in the
number of measurements required.
We analyze three different types of algorithms (the last one
has two ﬂavors), related to those described in the compressive
sensing literature (see Section I-A).
Our algorithms are related to linear programming relaxations
used in the compressive sensing (CS) literature. In CS the 0
norm minimization is relaxed to an 1 norm minimization. In the
noise-free case this relaxation results in a linear program since
the measurements are linear. In contrast, in group testing, the
measurements are non-linear and boolean. Furthermore, noise
in the group testing scenario is also boolean unlike additive
noises encountered in CS. Consequently, we also have to relax
boolean measurements. We do so by using a novel combination
of inequality and positivity constraints. Our LP formulation and
analysis is related to LP decoding of error-correcting codes [8],
where one uses a “minimum distance” decoding criteria based
2 For instance [4] considers group-testing algorithms that are resilient to all
noise patterns wherein at most a fraction q of the results differ from their true
values, rather than the probabilistic guarantee we give against most fractionq errors. This is analogous to the difference between combinatorial codingtheoretic error-correcting codes (for instance Gilbert-Varshamov codes [5]) and
probabilistic information-theoretic codes (for instance [6]). In this work we
concern ourselves only with the latter, though it is possible that our techniques
can also be used to analyzed the former.
3 We wish to highlight the difference between noise and errors. We use the
former term to refer to noise in the outcomes of the group-test, regardless
of the group-testing algorithm used. The latter term is used to refer to the
error due to the estimation process of the group-testing algorithm.

on perturbation analysis of the norm of the error vector. The
idea is to decode to a vector pair consisting of defective items,
x, and the error vector, η such that the error-vector η is as
“small” as possible by solving a sequence of LPs. We call
this algorithm the Noisy Combinatorial Basis Pursuit via LP
decoding (NCBP-LP). Using standard concentration results we
show that the solution to our LP decoding algorithm recovers
the true defective items with high probability. Furthermore, we
achieve near-optimal performance in the sense that our sample
complexity for NCBP-LP match the lower bounds within a
constant factor, where the constant is independent of the number
of items n and the defective set size d (but may depend on
the noise parameter q, and the error probability ). Based
on this analysis, we can directly derive the performance of
two other LP-based decoding algorithms. In particular CBP-LP
considers the noiseless measurement scenario, and NCBP-SLP+
and NCBP-SLP- consider the noisy measurement scenario, but
only use constraints corresponding to positive and negative test
outcomes respectively. 4
“Small-error” probability: To gain new insights into the constants involved in sample-complexity we admit a small but ﬁxed
error probability, . Thus our sample complexity bounds have to
be interpreted probabilistically, namely, with T measurements,
we can identify the true set of defectives with probability at
least (1 − ), where the probability is taken over all the sources
on randomness. With this new perspective we can derive upper
bounds that hold not only in an order-wise sense but also where
the constants involved in these order-wise bounds can be made
explicit.
Explicit Sample Complexity Bounds: Our sample complexity
bounds are of the form T ≥ β(q, )d log(n). The function
β(q, ) is an explicitly computed function of the noise parameter
q and admissible error probability . In the literature, orderoptimal upper and lower bounds on the number of tests required
are known for the problems we consider (for instance [3],
[10]). In both the noiseless and noisy variants, the number of
measurements required to identify the set of defective items is
known to be T = Θ(d log(n)) – here n = |N | is the total
number of items and d = |D| is the size of the defective
subset. In fact, if only D, an upper bound on d, is known, then
T = Θ(D log(n)) measurements are also known to be necessary
and sufﬁcient. In our algorithms we explicitly demonstrate that
we require only a knowledge of D rather than the exact value of
d. Furthermore, in the noisy variant, we show that the number
of tests required is in general at most a constant factor larger
than in the noiseless case (where this constant β is independent
of both n and d, but may depend on the noise parameter q and
the allowable error-probability of the algorithm).
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the model and corresponding notation, and describe the
4 Work by [9] has considered LP decoding for graph constrained group-testing
with noiseless measurements. However, there are signiﬁcant differences in the
model (we allow noisy measurements with no constraints on the measurement
set), analytical techniques (we have a probabilistic perturbation analysis), and
results (the number of measurements required in our setting is signiﬁcantly
smaller).

algorithms analyzed in this work. In Section III, we describe
the main results of this work. Section IV contains the analysis
of the group-testing algorithms considered.
A. Compressive Sensing
Compressive sensing has received signiﬁcant attention over
the last decade. We describe the version most related to the topic
of this paper [11], [12]. This version considers the following
problem. Let x be an exactly d-sparse vector in Rn , i.e., a vector
with at most d non-zero components (in general in the situations
of interest d = o(n)).
Let z correspond to a noise vector added to the measurement
M x. One is given a set of “compressed noisy measurements” of
x as y = M x+z. (The noise is guaranteed to be not “too large”
(||z||2 ≤ c2 ).) The T ×n matrix M is designed by choosing each
entry i.i.d. from a suitable probability distribution (for instance,
the set of zero-mean, 1/n variance Gaussian random variables).
The decoder must use the resulting noisy measurement vector
y ∈ RT and the matrix M to estimate in a computationally
efﬁcient manner the underlying vector x. The challenge is to do
so with as few measurements as possible, i.e., with the number
of rows T of M being as small as possible.
1) Basis Pursuit: An alternate decoding procedure proceeds
by relaxing the compressive sensing problem into the convex
optimization problem called Basis Pursuit (BP).
x = arg min ||x||1

(1)

subject to ||y − M x||2 ≤ c2

(2)

It can be shown (for instance [11], [12]) that there exist
constants c4 , c5 and c6 such that with T = c4 d log(n), with
probability at least 1 − 2c5 n , the solution x∗ to BP satisﬁes
||x∗ − x||2 ≤ c6 ||z||2 .
II. BACKGROUND
A. Model and Notation
A set N contains n items, of which an unknown subset D are
said to be “defective”.5 The goal of group-testing is to correctly
identify the set of defective items via a minimal number of
“group tests”, as deﬁned below.
Each row of a T × n binary group-testing matrix M corresponds to a distinct test, and each column corresponds to a
distinct item. Hence the items that comprise the group being
tested in the ith test are exactly those corresponding to columns
containing a 1 in the ith location. The method of generating
such a matrix M is part of the design of the group test. This
along with the method of estimating the set D, is described in
Section II-B.
The length-n binary input vector x represents the set N , and
contains 1s exactly in the locations corresponding to the items
5 It is common (see for example [13]) to assume that the number d of defective
items in D is known, or at least a good upper bound D on d, is known a priori.
If not, other work (for example [14]) considers non-adaptive algorithms with
low query complexity that help estimate d. However, in this work we explicitly
consider algorithms that do not require such foreknowledge of d – rather, our
algorithms have “good” performance with O(D log(n)) measurements.

Fig. 1. NCBP-LP: Constraint (7) relaxes the constraint that each xj ∈ {0, 1},
¯
¯
and constraint (6) indicates that there are exactly d defective items in the dth
iteration of the LP. The variables ηi are “slack variables” in the equations (4)
and (5). For instance, if test i is truly negative, then all the variables in an
equation of the form (4) are zero. However, if the test is a false negative, then
the variable ηi is then set to equal the number of defective items in test i.
Similarly, if a test i is truly positive, then ηi is zero, and equations of the form
(5) are satisﬁed. However, if the test is a false positive, then ηi is set to equal
1 (and the xj variables tested in test j are set to 0). Note that ηi is bounded
above by 1 in the case of (false) positives, but is only bounded above by D
in the case of (false) negatives. This is due to the asymmetry of positive and
negative test outcomes – multiple positive items tested simultaneously do not
give a different outcome from a single positive item tested.

of D. 6 The outcomes of the noiseless tests correspond to the
length-T binary noiseless result vector y, with a 1 in the ith
location if and only if the ith test contains at least one defective
item. The observed vector of test outcomes in the noisy scenario
ˆ
is denoted by the length-T binary noisy result vector y – the
probability that each entry yi of y differs from the corresponding
ˆ
entry yi in y is q, where q is the noise parameter. The locations
ˆ
where the noiseless and the noisy result vectors differ is denoted
by the length-T binary noise vector ν, with 1s in the locations
where they differ. The estimate of the locations of the defective
ˆ
items is encoded in the length-n binary estimate vector x, with
1s in the locations where the group-testing algorithms described
in Section II-B estimate the defective items to be.
The probability of error of any group-testing algorithm is
deﬁned as the probability (over the input vector x, group-testing
matrix M , and noise vector ν) that the estimated vector differs
from the input vector.
B. Algorithms
We now describe our algorithms in both the noiseless and
noisy settings. The algorithms are speciﬁed by the choices of
encoding matrices and decoding algorithms. The T × n grouptesting matrix M is deﬁned by randomly selecting each entry
in it in an i.i.d. manner to equal 1 with probability p = 1/D,
and 0 otherwise.
Noisy CBP-LP (NCBP-LP):
A linear relaxation of the group-testing problem leads naturally to NCBP-LP (3-9). In particular, each xi is relaxed to
¯
satisfy 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1, d represents our “guess” for the value of
6 The locations with ones/defective items are said to be positive – the other
locations are said to be negative. We use these terms interchangeably.

Fig. 2. CBP-LP: This LP simply attempts to ﬁnd any feasible solution for
¯
any value of d ∈ {0, . . . , D}

d ≤ D, and the non-linear measurements are linearized in (4)(5). Also, we deﬁne “slack” variables ηi for all i ∈ {1, . . . , T }
to account for errors in the test outcome. For a particular test i
this ηi is deﬁned to be zero if a particular test result is correct,
and positive (and at least 1) if the test result is incorrect. Of
course, the decoder does not know a priori which scenario
a particular test outcome falls under, and hence has to also
decode η. Nonetheless, as is common in the ﬁeld of errorcorrection [15], often using a “minimum distance” decoding
criteria (decoding to a vector pair (x, η) such that the errorvector η is as “small” as possible) leads to good decoding
performance. Our LP decoder attempts to do so.
To be more precise, we deﬁne the pair (ˆ , η ) to be feasible
x ˆ
ˆ
if x is a binary vector of weight at most D, and η ∈ RT is
ˆ
a vector of Hamming weight at most T q(1 + τ ). (The value
of τ is a code-design parameter to be speciﬁed later.) We then
¯
solve the sequence of LPs in (3–9) for each d ∈ {1, . . . , D}
¯ η (d)) in the sequence
¯
and output the ﬁrst feasible pair (ˆ (d), ˆ
x
(and output an error if there are none). That is, the decoder
sequentially attempts to ﬁnd valid solutions for the above LP
¯
for sequentially increasing integers starting from d = 0. If no
feasible solution is found, or if an infeasible solution is found,
¯
the decoder increments d by 1 and continues until it ﬁnds a valid
¯
solution for any value of d ≤ D (if so, the decoder stops and
¯
outputs that) or it reaches d > D (if so, the decoder declares
an error). Our analysis demonstrates that this algorithm has a
“small” probability of error.
Combinatorial Basis Pursuit via LP decoding (CBP-LP):
CBP-LP, which analyzes the scenario with noiseless measurements, is a special case of NCBP-LP with each ηj variable set
to zero. Hence it reduces to the problem of ﬁnding any feasible
point in the constraint set (11-14)
NCBP via Simpler LP decoding (NCBP-SLP):
In fact, it turns out that simpler LPs still gives essentially
the same performance as NCBP-LP. Consider the two LPs
given above. The intuition is that if NCBP-LP and works by
ﬁnding a η vector with low Hamming weight, then NCBP-SLP+
(respectively NCBP-SLP-) does the same by ﬁnding a η vector
with low Hamming weight restricted just to the set of positive
(respectively negative) outcomes. Since the noise that converts
ˆ
y to y is probabilistic, by standard concentration results these
two approaches should, with high probability, lead to the same
result.

III. M AIN R ESULTS
The analysis of the constants in the three main theorems
are not optimized7 but the constants are given to demonstrate
the functional dependence on δ and q. Our algorithms’ sample
complexities are commensurate (up to a constant factor) with
the information-theoretic lower bound [7], which we restate it
here for the sake of completion.
Theorem 1 (Lower Bound): Any group-testing algorithm that
has measurements that are noisy i.i.d. with probability q and
that has a probability of error at most requires at least of
(1−n−δ )
1−H(q) (D log(n/D)) tests.
We next derive upper bounds based on LP. We observe that
when 1 − 2q → 0, the lower and upper bounds have the same
functional dependence on (1−2q). We deﬁne Γ as ln(D)/ ln(n)
and γ as (2Γ + δ)/(1 + Γ + δ) (note that in the limit of large n,
Γ lies in the interval [0, 1) and γ in the interval (δ/(δ + 1), 1].

IV. A NALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS
We sketch the proof of Theorem 2 (full details are in [16]),
and note that Theorems 3 and 4 are direct corollaries.
Proof sketch of Theorem 2: Without loss of generality, let x
be the vector with 1s in the ﬁrst d locations, and 0s in the last
n − d locations.8

For the purpose of exposition we break the main ideas into
ﬁve steps below. First, we consider the easier case when the
exact value of d is known.
(1) Finite set of Perturbation Vectors: For the known d case we
deﬁne a ﬁnite set Φ (that depends on the true x) containing sod(n−d)
called “perturbation vectors”.9 In particular, Φ = {φ }k =1
is the set of d(n − d) vectors with a single −1 in the support of x, a single 1 outside the support of x, and zeroes
everywhere else. For instance, the ﬁrst φ in the set equals
(−1, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), where the 1 is in the (d + 1)th
¯
location. We demonstrate that any x in the feasible set of the
constraint set of NCBP-LP can be written as the true x plus a
non-negative linear combination of perturbation vectors from
this set. The physical intuition behind the proof is that the
vectors from Φ correspond to a “mass-conserving” perturbation
of x. The property of non-negativity of the linear combinations
arises from a physical argument demonstrating that there is
a path from x to any point in the feasible set using these
perturbations, over which one never has to “back-track”. The
linear combination property is important, since this enables
us to characterize the directions in which a vector can be
perturbed from x to another vector that satisﬁes the constraints
of NCBP-LP, in a “ﬁnite” manner (instead of having to consider
the uncountably inﬁnite number of directions that x could be
perturbed to). The non-negativity of the linear combination is
also crucial since, as we explain below, this property ensures
that the objective function of the LP can only increase when
perturbed in a convex combination of the directions in Φ .
(2) Expected Perturbation Cost: The heart of our argument then
lies in the characterization with an exhaustive case-analysis
of the expected change (over randomness in the matrix M
and noise ν) in the value of each slack variable ηi when x
¯
is perturbed to some x by a vector in Φ . In particular, we
demonstrate that for each such individual perturbation vector,
the expected change in the value of each slack variable ηi is
strictly positive with high probability. The actual proof follows
from a case-analysis similar to that in the example in Table I.
(3) Concentration & Union Bounding: With slightly careful use
of standard concentration inequalities (speciﬁcally, we need to
use both the additive and multiplicative forms of the Chernoff
bound) we show that the probability distributions derived above
concentrate. We then take the union bound over all vectors in
Φ (in fact, there are a total of d(n − d) such vectors in Φ )
and show that with high probability the expected change in the
value of the objective function (which equals the weighted sum
of the changes in the values of the slack variables ηi ) for each
vector in Φ is also strictly positive.
(4) Generalization Based on Convexity: We then note that the
set of feasible (¯ , η) of NCBP-LP forms a convex set. Hence if
x
η strictly increases along every direction in Φ , then in fact η
strictly increases when the true x is perturbed in any direction
(since, as noted before, any vector in the feasible set can be
written as x plus a non-negative linear combination of vectors

7 Doing

so is analytically very cumbersome. Detailed calculations are in [16].
can be veriﬁed, our analysis is agnostic to the actual choice of x, as long
as it is a vector in {0, 1}n of weight any d ≤ D.

TABLE I. Suppose x = (1, 1, 0). Choose some x = x (in this example, x = x + φ , where φ = (−1, 0, 1) is a perturbation vector). This example analyzes
the expectation (over the randomness in the particular row mi of the measurement matrix M ) of the difference in value of the corresponding slack variables ηi (x)
and ηi (x ) in column 8(b). To compute these, we consider the columns of the table above sequentially from left to right. Column 1 considers the two possible
values of the observed vector yi . Column 2 gives the corresponding values of the slack variables corresponding to the ith test, as returned by the constraints (4)
ˆ
and (5) of NCBP-LP – here (f (x))+ denotes the function max{f (x), 0}. Column 3 indexes the possibilities of the (noiseless) test outcomes yi , and column 4
enumerates possible values for mi , the i-th row of M , that could have generated the values of yi in column 3, given that x = (1, 1, 0). Column 5 computes
the probability of a particular observation yi and a row mi , given that the noiseless output yi equaled a particular value. Column 6 computes the function in
ˆ
column 2, given that mi equals the value given in Column 4. Columns 7 and 8(a) respectively explicitly compute the value of the function in column 6 for the
vectors x and x – the red entries in column 8(a) index those locations where η(x ), the slack variable for the perturbed vector, is less than η(x), and the green
cells indicate those locations where the situation is reverse. Column 8(b) then computes the product of column 5 with the difference of the entries in column 7
from those of column 8(a), i.e., the expected change in the value of the slack variable ηi (.). The value (1 − 2q)(1 − p)2 p in blue at the bottom represents the
expected change (averaged over all possible tuples (yi , mi , yi )).
ˆ

in Φ ). Hence the true x must be the solution to NCBP-LP.
(5) Extension to unknown d: Finally, we invoke Theorem 4
from [7] that demonstrates that in fact, with high probability
(for appropriate choice of parameters τ and T ) there is exactly
¯
one value of d ≤ D for which a feasible pair (ˆ , η (d)) exists,
x ˆ ¯
ˆ
(and this pair is unique, and the corresponding x = x), and in
¯
fact this d = d. The proof in [16] is information-theoretic in
spirit, and is analogous to “nearest-neighbour decoding”. Hence
in our proof we can assume that the sequence of LPs returns
infeasible solutions for each D = d, and a feasible (and correct)
solution only for the correct D.
Proof of Theorem 3: We substitute q = 0 into Theorem 2 and
choose the largest term.
Proof of Theorem 4: The proof is essentially the same as in
the case of Theorem 2. Details in [16].
