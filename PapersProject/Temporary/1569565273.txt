Abstract—This work addresses the problem of correlation
detection in a group of elliptically-contoured variables, when the
number p of variates greatly exceeds the number n of observed
samples. We exploit the properties inherent to the Z-score
representation of the data set to devise two different decision
tests, whose performances are assessed by upper bounding the
Type I and Type II error probabilities. The results speciﬁcally
apply to the asymptotic regime where the number of variates p
is large, and the number of samples n is ﬁnite and ﬁxed.

I. I NTRODUCTION
An increasing number of practical applications require the
solution of inference problems on high dimensional data sets,
where the amount of considered features is large (some examples are sensor networks, gene expressions arrays, multimedia
databases, multivariate ﬁnancial time series, and trafﬁc in
communication networks). Their unifying trait is the small
number n of available samples, in comparison to the feature
dimension p. In this context, especially challenging tasks are
the correlation screening problem [1], i.e. the identiﬁcation
of signiﬁcant levels of linear dependence, and the covariance
structure testing problem [2]. In gene expression analysis, for
example, a biologist might be interested to test for structure
of the gene regulatory network, but only has a handful (n)
of samples to construct the sample correlation matrix between
tens of thousands (p) of gene probes. In this situation classical
large n asymptotic techniques cannot be reliably applied.
This work addresses the simpler problem of deciding
whether the high dimensional data set is completely uncorrelated. Building upon the U -score representation introduced in
[1] we test properties of the empirical distribution to decide
the diagonality of the covariance matrix. This work extends
previous results that hold only in the limiting asymptotic
regime p → ∞, n → ∞. For normal multivariate samples,
for instance, [3] provides the asymptotic distribution of the
maximum eigenvalue of the sample correlation matrix. This
statistic, however, is only meaningful for p < n. In [4] a
quadratic form of the sample covariance matrix is shown to
be a consistent statistic even for p > n, if n and p have equal
growth rate. Under the same conditions, [5] and [6] derive the
asymptotic distribution of the maximum sample correlation
coefﬁcient, test statistic ﬁrst considered in [7], [8].
Differently from this approach, the results presented here
speciﬁcally apply to the asymptotic regime p → ∞ with
n ﬁxed and ﬁnite, also considered in [1], [9]. Unlike in
correlation screening for sparse correlation matrices [1], we
are interested in global tests for diagonal covariance, here

derived applying the theory of exchangeability and the method
of types.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews the
U -score representation of the data set introduced in [1].
The decision problem is formally deﬁned in Section III.
In Section III-A and Section III-B two different tests are
proposed, whose performances are characterized by means of
the respective Type I and Type II error exponents. Section IV
provides experimental results.
II. T HE GEOMETRY OF CORRELATION
Let the size p random vector X be distributed according to
an elliptically-contoured density fX (x) (e.g. the multivariate
normal, or the multivariate t-distribution, see [10, Sec. 2.7]
and references therein). The elliptically-contoured density is
speciﬁed by the parameters µ, Σ, and g(·), where g(·) is a
non-negative monotonic function:
fX (x) = |Σ|−1/2 g (x − µ)T Σ−1 (x − µ) .
The elements of X are assumed to have ﬁnite ﬁrst and second
moments. This section introduces different possible representations of the data set collected by making n independent
drawings from the a priori distribution fX (x).
A. Z-score and U -score representations of the data
Raw data set: The matrix X[n×p] is formed by (vertically)
stacking n independent drawings from fX (x).
Z-scores: The matrix Z[n×p] is obtained centering and normalizing the columns of X with respect to their sample mean
and standard deviation. Let mi = (n)−1 1T x(i) denote the i-th
sample mean, and s2 = (n − 1)−1 (x(i) − mi 1)T (x(i) − mi 1)
i
the i-th sample variance. The columns of Z are obtained from
the columns of X as
x(i) − mi 1
,
∀i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , p}.
(1)
z (i) =
(n − 1) si
Geometrically, the columns of Z are points living in the Rn
space. Each z (i) belongs to the intersection of the hyperplane
Mn−1 = {z ∈ Rn : 1T z = 0} with the unit hypersphere
Sn−1 = {z ∈ Rn : z = 1}.
U -scores [1]: The matrix U[(n−1)×p] is obtained from
Z as a result of the rotation by H∗ of its columns, and
of their subsequent projection over Mn−1 . Deﬁne H∗ as
an orthonormal matrix1 whose ﬁrst row is parallel to 1T ,
1 As explained in [1], the matrix H∗ can be easily obtained via GramSchmidt orthogonalization of the matrix composed by 1T and any other
arbitrarily chosen n − 1 linearly independent row vectors.

the vector orthogonal to Mn−1 . The ﬁrst row in H∗ Z is
identically null, and is removed by the projection onto Mn−1 .
The U -score matrix is given by U = HZ, where H is H∗
deprived of its ﬁrst row. Geometrically, the columns of U are
points in the Rn−1 space. The transformation Hz (i) is norm
preserving, so that the columns of U belong to Sn−2 .
The geometry of correlation [1]: In [1, Sec. 2] the analysis
of the properties of the U -scores for elliptically-contoured
fX (x) is presented. When the elements of X are uncorrelated,
and Σ is diagonal, the distribution of the columns of U is
uniform on Sn−2 . For non-diagonal Σ the distribution is,
in general, far from uniform. This property is the key to
establishing the correlation detection procedure proposed here.

labeling) of the random variables is redundant, and can be
discarded. This conceptual operation is formalized as the
resampling (without replacement) of the data set U. The
resampled data set V is deﬁned by V = UP , where the matrix
P is random and uniformly distributed over the set P ⊂ Bp×p
of permutation matrices. Therefore, for p = 2 the density of
V for the arguments (v, w) is equal to

B. Statistical properties

Proposition 3. The probability density function of the resampled data set fV (v (1) , · · · , v (p) ) has form

In this subsection some relevant statistical properties of the
matrices X, Z and U are derived. The matrix X, composed
of independent drawings from fX (x), is row–exchangeable
[11], i.e. its probability law is unchanged upon row permutation. The conversion in Z-scores, detailed in (1), preserves
exchangeability (though not independence) of the rows of Z.
These considerations justify the following proposition.
Proposition 1. The matrix Γ(ij) = cov Z (i),Z (j) has the form
Γ(ij) = β (ij) 11T + (α(ij) − β (ij) ) I.
If Xi and Xj are uncorrelated, then α

f (1) (2) (v, w) + fU (2) U (1) (v, w),

where 1/2 is the probability of choosing any of the two
permutation matrices. Extending this argument to general
values of p yields the following proposition.

)=
fUP |P =P a v (1) , · · · , v (p) .
p! a=1

As it is evident from (5), the distribution fV (v (1) , · · · , v (p) )
is invariant upon permutation of the arguments. The resampled
data set V is hence an exchangeable sequence [11] of random
points in the Rn−1 space. This implies, in particular, that each
column in V is distributed according to the same marginal
fV (v). The covariance between any pair of columns of V is
given by

Proposition 2. The matrix Υ(ij)= cov U (i),U (j) has the form
Υ(ij) = (α(ij) − β (ij) ) I.
If Xi and Xj are uncorrelated, then Υ

(ij)

(3)

Proof: The U -scores covariance matrix can be represented
as Υ(ij) = HΓ(ij) HT . Combining this representation with (2)
yields Υ(ij) = β (ij) H11T HT + (α(ij) − β (ij) )HHT . Recall
that the rows of the matrix H belong, by construction, to the
hyperplane Mn−1 . This implies H1 = 0, and hence (3).
III. C ORRELATION DETECTION
Making use of the representation of the data set exposed
in Section II we formulate the hypothesis test in the R(n−1)
space associated with the U -scores. From now on we denote
U = U (1) , · · · , U (p) the vector of random points belonging
to Sn−2 . The proposed hypotheses to be tested are
H1 : fU (u(1) , · · · , u(p) ) = U (Sn−2 )

,

(4)

where U (Sn−2 ) is the uniform distribution on Sn−2 . As a
consequence of the properties of the elliptically-contoured
density fX (x), H0 is veriﬁed only if Σ is diagonal. The
testing of the hypotheses (4) is difﬁcult, since the observed
matrix U represents a single drawing from fU (u(1) , · · · , u(p) ).
We propose a simple testing strategy, based on the following
observation: since the test aims to detect the presence of
correlated variables in the vector X, but not to identify the
correlated pairs, the information about the identities (i.e. the

2

The testing procedure will be performed on V. It
is straightforward to verify that, when H0 is in force,
fV (v (1) , · · · , v (p) ) = fU (v (1) , · · · , v (p) ). The hypotesis testing
problem on fV (v (1) , · · · , v (p) ) can now be solved easily, as
shown below. Since exchangeability allows to consider each
column of V as a drawing from fV (v), the high dimensionality
p of the problem can be exploited to test, without requiring
large sample size n.
A. The empirical squared distance test
Let Q∗ = {(i, j) : i, j ∈ {1, · · · , p}, i < j}. The vector
D(V) = (D1 , · · · , Dp(p−1)/2 ) is constructed by stacking
in sequence, ∀(i, j) ∈ Q∗ , the pairwise squared Euclidean
distances Dk = V (i) − V (j) 2 . As consequence of the
exchangeability of V, the distribution fD (d1 , · · · , dp(p−1)/2 )
is invariant with respect to the permutation of the arguments,
and D is exchangeable as well. The explicit expression of
E[D], i.e. the expectation of the marginal distribution of D, is
given in the following proposition.
Proposition 4. The expectation of the random variable D is
given by
E[D] = 2 1 − tr cov (V , W ) − E [V ]
where γ = tr cov (V , W ) + E[V ] 2 .

2

= 2(1 − γ), (7)

Proof: Because of the exchangeability of the elements in
V, E [D] = E V − W 2 . Consider the following relation
tr cov (V , W ) = E V T W − E[V ] 2
(8)
1
= 1 − E V −W 2 − E[V ] 2 , (9)
2
where (8) is a consequence of the linearity of the trace and of
the expectation, and (9) is due to the fact that V 2 = W 2 =
1. Rearranging (9) yields (7).
The value E [D] belongs to the interval [0, 2]. When H0 is
true, E[V ] 2 = 0, and Υ(ij) = 0 I, ∀(i, j) ∈ Q, so that, after
(6), tr cov (V , W ) = 0. As a consequence E D H0 = 2,
i.e. the expectation E [D] is maximized when H0 is true. This
motivates using the average of the vector D(V) as the test
statistic T

(11)

The threshold value τ will satisfy τ ≥ 2/(p − 1).
The performance of the test is characterized evaluating the
Type I and Type II error probabilities.
Proposition 5. The Type I error probability relative to the
threshold test (11) is bounded by

where (16) is deduced using the relation 2 = E [D] + 2γ
introduced in (7). Lemma 7 in Appendix A allows to establish
the relation 2γ ≥ −2/(p − 1). As a consequence of the
threshold choice τ ≥ 2/(p − 1) it is concluded 2γ + τ ≥ 0.
This justiﬁes (17), derived making use of the upper tail bound
(30) in Lemma 9 in Appendix A.
For 2γ < τ , the last term in (17) is evaluated using the
lower tail bound (31) derived in Lemma 9, and this yields the
second part of (13). For 2γ ≥ τ , (17) can be developed as
1

2

PII = 1 − e− 4 p(p−1)(2γ+τ ) − 1 + P(T − E [D] > 2γ − τ ),
from which the ﬁrst part of (13) is ﬁnally obtained by
substitution of (31).
As it is clear from (12) and (13), for 2γ ≥ τ the test is
characterized by a fast decrease of the error probability as
the dimension p increases, forcing it to zero for p → ∞.
The constant γ is null when H0 is in force, and, for high
dimensional problems (i.e. when the modelization p → ∞
is allowed), is always positive (Lemma 7 in Appendix A). It
increases whenever there is correlation among the elements
of V, and/or the marginal fV (v (1) , · · · , v (p) ) over Sn−2 deviates from symmetry about the origin of Rn−1 . Thus γ can
be understood as a measure of divergence of the empirical
fV (v (1) , · · · , v (p) ) from the uniform distribution on Sn−2 , as
a function of its ﬁrst and second order statistics. If 2γ < τ ,
this will almost surely induce a Type II error, for p → ∞.
B. The empirical entropy test

As discussed above, testing the average of the squared distance between the columns of V allows to detect the deviation,
expressed by γ, of the empirical distribution from the uniform
The Type II error probability is bounded by
distribution on the sphere. For some a priori densities fX (x),

vector X is composed of elements that are both positively
(13) and negatively correlated2 , or for the sparse correlation regime,
Proof: The proof relies on Lemma 8 and Lemma 9 when only κ ≪ p elements are correlated. Under these circumin Appendix A. Lemma 8 proves that the variables in D stances the test on the empirical squared distances will have
have negative association [12]. This property is intuitively reduced power of rejecting the null hypothesis for symmetric,
clear: since the surface Sn−2 is bounded, the increase of but not uniform, marginal distributions. This section outlines
the distance of one point on Sn−2 with another induces an alternative test, based on the method of types [13]. As it

important consequence of negative association of the variables in p, but allows a Type II error exponent that is better behaved
in D is that it permits the application of Chernoff-type large for symmetric marginals under the alternative hypothesis.

Proof: Consider the set of probability mass functions
deﬁned on the support {1, · · · , m}, and deﬁne its partition
(F, F c ). We establish convexity of F and F c . By convexity of the Kullback-Lieber divergence [14, Thm. 2.7.2], for
µ3 = αµ1 + (1 − α)µ2 , with µ1 , µ2 ∈ F and α ∈ [0, 1]
D(µ3 ||µ0 ) ≤ αD(µ1 ||µ0 ) + (1 − α)D(µ2 ||µ0 ) ≤ log m − τ
so that µ3 ∈ F . Similarly, by concavity of the entropy [14,
Thm. 2.7.3], for µ1 , µ2 ∈ F c
H(µ3 ) ≥ αH(µ1 ) + (1 − α)H(µ2 ) ≥ τ,

so that µ3 ∈ F is established.
Finally the Type I probability of error (19) can be evaluated
using Sanov’s theorem [14, Thm. 12.4.1] as

As pointed out above, the test will almost surely induce a

The Type II probability of error can be decreased by increasing

IV. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section presents an experimental assessment of the
performance of the empirical squared distance test for ﬁnite
dimension. The ROC curves are obtained generating 104 data
matrices, each given by n i.i.d. drawings from a Gaussian pvariate distribution with random covariance matrix and mean
vector. In Figure 1 the performance of the empirical squared
distance (SqDist) test proposed in Section III-A is compared

4

with the ROC curves for the maximum Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient (MaxCor) and maximum Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient (MaxRCor) tests [7], and for the S biggest
correlation coefﬁcients test (MaxCorS) [8], where S = 5. All
the tests have comparable complexity.
For p = 50 and n = 12 the SqDist test outperforms the
alternatives. Figure 1 presents also the SqDist ROC curves for
n = 6 and n = 3: it can be observed that the SqDist test
(n = 3) achieves a performance comparable to the MaxCor
and MaxCorS tests (n = 12), but requiring only 1/4 the
number of samples. For comparison, the SqDist curve for
p = 100 and n = 3 is depicted as well, showing that, as
expected, increasing p for ﬁxed n improves the performance.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this work two tests for correlation detection in large data
sets of elliptically-contoured variables are presented. Their
performance is characterized for ﬁnite values of n, using
Chernoff and Sanov bounds. The properties of the U -scores
allow to take advantage of the high dimension of the problem
without requiring n to go to inﬁnity. Using vector quantization
to discretize the empirical distribution of the U -scores leads to
a simple test statistic whose Type I and Type II error exponents
can be computed using the method of types.

Lemma 7. The trace of the covariance cov (V , W ) is lower
bounded by −1/(p − 1) ≤ tr cov (V , W ) .
Proof: In order to derive the lower bound, some prelimip
nary results are needed. Deﬁne U = i=1 U (i) . Positiveness
is established by
of the quantity tr cov U , U

where (21) is obtained by linearity of the trace and of the
expectation. The inequality in (22) follows applying Jensen’s
inequality to the convex function · 2 . Now consider the
following expression:
tr cov U , U

The ﬁrst term in (23) is obtained by linearity of the trace and
of the expectation, and using the relation E U (i) 2 = 1;
the second term is obtained applying (6). Rearranging (23)
yields
tr cov U , U

E[U ]

where I is a random variable identifying the minimum valued
component in the vector D. The distribution fD|U,I is a
permutation distribution in the sense deﬁned in [12, Def.
2.10], and hence is negatively associated [12, Thm. 2.11].
This implies that the ﬁrst term in the right hand of (25) is
negative. The negativity of the second term follows by the
same argument in the proof to [12, Thm. 2.11].
Lemma 9. The average of the random vector D obeys
Chernoff-type large deviation bounds. In particular, for ǫ > 0

Proof: The proof is obtained via a slight modiﬁcation of
the proof of [12, Thm. 2.11]. Let D 1 , D 2 denote an arbitrary
partition of the vector D, and let f1 (·), f2 (·) denote a pair
of non-decreasing, permutation invariant functions. Using [12,
(1.1)] it is possible to write
cov (f1 (D 1 ), f2 (D 2 )) = E [cov (f1 (D 1 ), f2 (D 2 )|U, I)]
(25)
+ cov (E [f1 (D 1 )|U, I] , E [f2 (D 2 )|U, I]) ,

where the last equality is obtained because E [Di ] = E [Xi ].
Inspection of (27) conﬁrms that condition (ii) in [15, Def. 3.1]
is veriﬁed as well for λ = 1.
Now that the elements of D have been established to be
λ-correlated, [15, Thm. 3.2] can be used to evaluate the upper
tail bound as follows:

Lemma 8. The elements of the random vector D are negatively associated, i.e. for every pair A1 , A2 of disjoint subsets
of {1, 2, · · · , p(p − 1)/2}, and for any pair of non-decreasing
functions f1 (·), f2 (·), the following holds:

Noticing that the ﬁrst term is positive, because of (22), yields
the lower bound.

p(p−1) ǫ2

Proof: The proof relies on [15, Thm. 3.2]. Recall that the
elements of D are positive, bounded in the interval [0, 2]. In order to apply [15, Thm. 3.2] we need to prove that the elements
in D are λ-correlated, as deﬁned in [15, Def. 3.1]. Deﬁne a
vector X of p(p − 1)/2 independent random variables on the
support [0, 2], and such that E [Xi ] = E [D] , ∀i. This implies
p(p−1)/2

E Di = i=1
E Xi . Using linearity of the
i=1
expectation it is easy to see that condition (i) in [15, Def.
3.1] is satisﬁed. Now consider a non-negative function f (·).
Since the variables in D are negatively associated, invoking
[12, Property 2] gives

cov (f1 (Di , i ∈ A1 ), f2 (Dj , j ∈ A2 )) ≤ 0.

where (28) follows directly from [15, Thm. 3.2], obtained for
E [Xi ] = E [Di ] = E [D], λ = 1, Di ∈ [0, 2]. Algebraic
manipulation yields (29), and the substitution ǫ = ε E [D]
yields (30).
The lower tail bound is obtained as follows. Deﬁne the
random variables Ci = E [D]+1−Di and Yi = E [X]+1−Xi .
It is straightforward to verify that the elements of the vector
C are λ-correlated for λ = 1. Hence, apply [15, Thm. 3.2] to
obtain, in a similar manner to (29),

Substitution of the expression Ci in (31) shows that the
lower tail bound is equal to the upper tail bound (30). This
establishes (26).
