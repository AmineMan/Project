The two user MIMO IC, where user k (k = 1,2) has Mk
transmit and Nk receive antennas, was shown in [5] to have
min(M1+M2 ,N1+N2 ,max(M1 , N2 ),max(M2 , N1 )) DoF. For
this result, the achievability is based on linear zero forcing
beamforming schemes, and the converse is based on DoF outer
bounds for the multiple access channel. In [2], Cadambe and
Jafar introduced an asymptotic interference alignment scheme,
referred to as the [CJ08] scheme, leading to the result that
in the K-user MIMO IC, each user can access half-the-cake
almost surely (the “cake” refers to the maximum DoF of a
user when all interfering users are absent), when all nodes
are equipped with the same number of antennas and channels
are time-varying or frequency-selective. In [9], Motahari et al.
introduced the rational dimensions framework based on the
diophantine approximation theory wherein the [CJ08] scheme
is again applied to establish the same DoF result with constant
channels. For the 3-user MIMO IC with MT = MR = M > 1,
Cadambe and Jafar also present a closed form linear scheme
in [2] to achieve the DoF outer bound value of M/2 per
user, without the need for channel variations in time/frequency.
The DoF outer bound in each of these cases is based on the
pairwise outer bounds for any two users.
In [3], Gou and Jafar studied the DoF of the K-user MT ×
T ,MR )
MR MIMO IC under the assumption that η = max(MT ,MR )
min(M
η
is an integer and showed that each user has a fraction η+1
of the cake, almost surely, when K > η. While they use the
[CJ08] scheme over time-varying/frequency-selective channels
to show the optimal DoF achievability, in [9] Motahari et al.
employ the rational dimensions framework combined with the
[CJ08] scheme to establish the same DoF result with constant
channels and without channel extensions. Further, they show
η
that each user has a fraction η+1 of the cake, even when
max(MT ,MR )
MT +MR
η = min(MT ,MR ) is not an integer, provided K ≥ gcd(M ,M ) .

Interestingly, the achievability of η+1 min(MT , MR ) DoF or
M MR
equivalently MTT+MR DoF per user, follows from the application of the [CJ08] scheme for every MT , MR value, and requires no joint signal processing between multiple antennas at
either the transmitter or receiver sides. However, the optimality

of the DoF has been shown only when K ≥ gcd(M ,M ) .

Their outer bounds are merely based on cooperation DoF outer

paper we will explore DoF of these cases. Moreover, since
outer bounds based on full cooperation are not enough in these

Abstract— We show that the 3 user MT × MR MIMO interference channel where each transmitter is equipped with
MT and each receiver is equipped with MR antennas has
M
N
min 2−1/κ , 2+1/κ degrees of freedom (DoF) per user normalized by time, frequency, and space dimensions, where N =
max(MT , MR ), M = min(MT , MR ), κ = N M . While the
−M
information theoretic DoF outer bound is established for every
M, N value, the achievability, relying only on linear interference
alignment, is established in general subject to a normalization
with respect to spatial-extensions, i.e., the scaling of the number
of antennas at all nodes. In the absence of spatial extensions,
we can also show through examples how essentially the same
alignment scheme may be applied over time or frequency
extensions. The central new insight to emerge from this work is
the notion of subspace alignment chains as DoF bottlenecks. The
subspace alignment chains are instrumental both in identifying
the extra dimensions provided by a genie to a receiver for the
DoF outer bound, as well as constructing the optimal interference
alignment schemes. In addition, our results also settle the question
of feasibility of linear interference alignment for the 3 user
MT ×MR MIMO interference channel, for all values of MT , MR .

I. I NTRODUCTION
The number of degrees of freedom (DoF) of a communication network provides a lens into the most essential aspects
of the communication problem. In this work we are interested
primarily in interference channels (IC). The DoF of IC are
known when all nodes are equipped with the same number
of antennas for almost all channel realizations. However, if
each node may have an arbitrary number of antennas, then
a general DoF characterization is unavailable beyond the 2
user IC, due to the explosion of the number of parameters
in considering arbitrary antenna conﬁgurations. However, as
we show in this work, the problem involves fundamental
challenges even when the number of parameters is restricted by
symmetry. In particular, the difﬁculty is to deal with the new
notion of “depth” of overlap between vector subspaces that
come into play on the one hand, and of translating this notion
into information theoretic bounds on the other. Speciﬁcally,
we will explore the simplest setting for MIMO IC where the
DoF are unknown.
As the smallest and the most elementary IC setting where
interference alignment becomes relevant, the 3 user IC has
special signiﬁcance. The assumption of global channel knowledge, and comparable signal strengths from all transmitters to
receivers that follows from the deﬁnition of the DoF metric, is
most relevant to small clusters of (no more than 3) mutually
interfering users. Let us start with a summary of related work.

will lead us to the desired conclusion.
II. S YSTEM M ODEL AND M ETRICS
Consider a fully connected three-user MIMO interference
channel where there are MT and MR antennas at each transmitter and receiver, respectively, each transmitter sending one
independent message to its desired receiver. Denote by Hji
the MR × MT channel matrix from transmitter i to receiver
j where i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We assume that the channel coefﬁcients are independently drawn from continuous distributions.
While our results are valid regardless of whether the channel
coefﬁcients are constant or varying in time/frequency, we will
assume the channels are constant in the exposition. Global
channel knowledge is assumed to be available at all nodes.
At time index t ∈ Z+ , Transmitter i sends a complex-valued
¯
MT × 1 signal vector Xi (t), which satisﬁes an average power
T

¯
constraint T t=1 E[ Xi (t) 2 ] ≤ ρ for T channel uses. At
the receiver side, User j receives an MR × 1 signal vector
¯
Yj (t) at time index t, which is given by:

beamforming over constant channels without the need for
symbol extensions in time, frequency or space.
Proof: Due to the space limitation, we only provide the
proofs for Lemma 1 through two speciﬁc examples in the
next section, to shed light on intuition behind the complicated
mathematic derivations. The general proofs of Lemma 1 and
Lemma 2 are presented in the full paper [1].
Theorem 1 (Spatially-Normalized DoF): For the 3-user
MT × MR MIMO IC, the spatially-normalized degrees of
freedom value per user is given by DoF = DoF .
Theorem 1 can also be equivalently explicitly represented as:

where Zj (t) an MR × 1 column vector representing the
i.i.d. circularly symmetric complex additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) at Receiver j, each entry of which is an i.i.d.
Gaussian random variable with zero-mean and unit-variance.
Let Rk (ρ) denote the achievable rate of User k where
ρ is also referred to as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
The concepts of capacity and DoF follow from the standard
deﬁnitions thus omitted here. Assume that the sum rate of this
channel is denoted as RΣ , and R = RΣ /3 denotes the rate
normalized per user. The sum DoF of this channel are deﬁned
as dΣ (MT , MR ), and d = dΣ /3 stands for the DoF per user.
Also, we use dk to denote the number of DoF associated with
User k, and the user index k is interpreted modulo 3 so that,
e.g., User 0 is the same as User 3. Furthermore, we deﬁne the
DoF normalized by the spatial dimension, DoFΣ (MT , MR ) as
DoFΣ (MT , MR )

A. Subspace Alignment Chains
Consider an arbitrary (MT , MR ) pair. If M = N , then halfthe-cake DoF results are reported in [2]. Since the DoF results
for 2M ≤ N are simple where interference alignment is not
required, we only consider 2M > N in the following.
We now introduce the key new concept of subspace alignment chains from the linear dimension counting argument. For
brevity, we ﬁrst suppose MR ≥ MT , which implies that zeroforcing at the transmitters is not possible. Since interference

Theorem 2 (Feasibility of Linear Interference Alignment):
For the 3-user MT × MR MIMO IC, the DoF value demand
per user, d, is feasible with linear interference alignment if
and only if d ≤ DoF .
Proof: The proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 follow directly
from Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, and are presented in [1].
Remark 1: The information theoretic DoF outer bound
holds for arbitrary values of MT , MR without any spatial
normalization. On the other hand, the DoF achievability is established in general subject to a normalization with respect to
spatial-extensions, i.e., the scaling of the number of antennas at
all nodes. Moreover, symbol extensions in time or frequency
over constant channels combined with asymmetric complex
signaling are sufﬁcient to achieve the optimal DoF. We carry
out this test to establish the DoF values for all (M, N ) values
up to M, N ≤ 10. In general, we end with the conjecture that
in all cases, the DoF outer bound value in Lemma 1 is tight1 .

and DoF(MT , MR ) = DoFΣ (MT , MR )/3 is similarly deﬁned.
The dependence on MT , MR may be dropped when no ambiguity would be caused. Also, the notation o(x) represents any
function f (x) such that limx→∞ f (x)/x = 0.

where M = min(MT , MR ), N = max(MT , MR ), κ =

N −M . The quantity κ denotes the length of the subspace
alignment chain, to be described later. Clearly, as N and M
become approximately equal (κ → 1), DoF converges to the
“half the cake” value, M/2. To arrive at the main result of this
paper, we proceed through two intermediate lemmas here.
Lemma 1 (Outer Bound): For the 3-user MT ×MR MIMO
IC, the DoF value per user is bounded above as d ≤ DoF .
Lemma 2 (Inner Bound): For the 3-user MT × MR MIMO
IC, the DoF per user value DoF is achievable with linear

1 Independent and concurrent work on linear outer bounds for integer DoF
values, was reported by Bresler et al at 2011 Allerton Conference and posted
on ArXiv shortly after the posting of our full paper [1]. To the best of our
understanding, all their results can be obtained as special cases of our results,
since we cover information theoretic outer bounds which imply linear bounds
as well as and non-integer DoF values. Also, the linear achievability results
of M. Amir, A. El-Keyi and M. Naﬁe, obtained independently prior to our
work, are recovered as special cases of our results as well.

cannot be eliminated, it is desirable to align interference. Let
us consider a vector V1(1) sent by T1 that causes interference
at R2 . This vector should align with a vector V3(1) sent by
T3 , which is also undesired at R2 . Since V3(1) also causes
interference at R1 , it should align there with a vector V2(1)
sent by T2 . The vector V2(1) in turn also causes interference
to R3 , so it should align with a vector V1(2) sent from T1 .
Continuing like this, we create a chain of desired alignments:

O

The main question is can we extend this subspace alignment
chain indeﬁnitely? Consider the setting M = N previously
solved in [2]. Cadambe and Jafar create this inﬁnite chain of
alignments using the asymptotic alignment scheme for M =
N = 1, and implicitly create an inﬁnite alignment chain in the
non-asymptotic solution for, e.g., M = N = 2, as the chain
closes upon itself to form a loop, i.e., V1(1) = V1(2) . The
chain closes upon itself mainly because the optimal signal
vectors are eigenvectors of the cumulative channel encountered
in traversing the alignment chain starting from any transmitter
and continuing until we return to the same transmitter. Thus,
the ideal solution of perfect alignment, achieved by an inﬁnite
(or closed-loop) alignment chain, is possible if M = N [2].
For general M, N , the subspace alignment chain can neither
be continued indeﬁnitely, nor be made to close upon itself.
While we show the chain in detail in [1], here we provide
an intuition behind the results in Theorem 1. For any values
p
MT
κN
of MR ∈ [ p−1 , p+1 ], the ﬁrst bound d ≤ 2κ+1 is from the
p
MT < MR setting. In this case, the length of the subspace
alignment chains, deﬁned as the times of the chain appearing
at the transmitter side, cannot be larger than κ = p = N M .
−M
This observation yields the intuition that if a total of κd0
dimensions are sent, they will create interference spaces of
(κ + 1)d0 dimensions. The desired signals and interference
together need a total of κd0+(κ+1)d0 = (2κ+1)d0 dimensions.
Since only 3N dimensions are available, we must have d0 ≤
3N
2κ+1 . Because each user sends κd0 /3 dimensions, we obtain
κN
κM
the N -bound d ≤ 2κ+1 . The second M -bound, d ≤ 2κ−1 can
be understood for the MT > MR setting with 2κ+1 in previous
case replaced with 2κ − 1. We provide an example in Fig.1
to show how we obtain the N -bound and M -bound, where
we use the solid lines to denote the corresponding subspace
involving in the alignment operations. The subspace alignment
Rx 3
Rx 1
Rx 2
chain, for example in Fig.1(a), is V1(1) ↔ V2(1) ↔ V3(1) ↔
V1(2) , which has length 4. Therefore, the limited length of
the subspace alignment chain creates the bottleneck on the
extent to which interference can be aligned, and is ultimately
the main factor determining the DoF value.

for which there is redundancy in both

there is no redundancy in either M or N . Because A and B
represent settings with maximum and minimum redundancy,
essentially they are the basis for the DoF outer bounds and
inner bounds, respectively. Take (M, N ) = (35, 50) as an
example. This channel lies in the range 2 ≤ M ≤ 5 . Now, we
3

know that the 35 × 50 setting has exactly 21 DoF. However,
note that the 35×49 setting also has only 21 DoF. Incidentally,
the 35 × 49 setting achieves the 21 DoF with only linear
beamforming based interference alignment. Therefore, clearly,
the 50th receive antenna is redundant from a DoF perspective.
2) The DoF Beneﬁt of MIMO Processing: In the K user
MIMO IC with M = N , there is no DoF beneﬁt of joint
processing among multiple antennas [2]. For the K-user
MT × MR MIMO IC, Ghasemi et al. have shown in [4] that
MT MR
MT +MR
MN
MT +MR = M +N DoF are optimal if K ≥ gcd(MT ,MR ) and
the achievability also does not need joint processing among
multiple antennas. In this paper, we show that A contains the
only M values for which there is no DoF beneﬁt of joint
N
processing among co-located antennas at the transmitters or
receivers. Consider (M, N ) = (3, 5) as an example. We show
that each user has 2 DoF purely through linear alignment based
MN
on beamforming, which is strictly larger than M +N = 15
8
reported in [4]. In fact, this may also be seen as a consequence
of the maximum redundancy in the M/N ∈ A settings.
IV. I NFORMATION - THEORETIC D O F O UTER B OUNDS
In this section, we show the information theoretic DoF outer
bound proofs only for (M, N ) = (2, 3) and (3, 4) cases, and
shed light on the intuition behind the proofs.
A. Case: (M, N ) = (2, 3) ⇒ DoF ≤

6
5

We take invertible linear transformations at each transmitter
and receiver, which do not affect the DoF of the channel.
The detailed process, due to the space limitation, is omitted
in this paper and presented in [1]. After the change of basis
operation, we obtain the network with connectivity in Fig.3,
where we only show the interference-carrying links. Since
each receiver can decode its own message, it can subtract the
signal caused by its own message from the received signal
Yk(·) of each antenna, to obtain the interference Sk(·) , as a
function of corresponding transmit signals and noise.

B. Observation
1) Redundant Dimensions: A particularly interesting observation from Theorem 1 and Fig.2 is that within each piecewise
linear interval, the DoF value depends only on either M or N .
This makes the other parameter somewhat redundant, i.e., it
can be reduced without reducing the DoF. The corner points
of these piecewise linear segments correspond to two sets,
A = { 1 , 2 , 3 , · · · } and B = { 1 , 3 , 5 , · · · }. The set A contains

First, a genie provides G1 = X2a to R1 . Note that all the
genie signal in this paper also includes noise. For brevity
and also because we are interested only in DoF, we do not
explicitly mention the noise term in the genie and received
signals. Let us consider R1 . Since we are dealing with a
converse argument, it follows by assumption that the receiver
is able to decode and subtract out its desired signal. It
n
therefore has X2c at the antenna “1c”. Thus, with G1 , R1 can
n
n
n
decode W2 from the observation (X2a , S1c (X2c )) subject to
2
the noise distortion . After decoding W2 it can reconstruct the
n
n
n
transmitted signals (X2a , X2c ) and subtract them from S1b to
n
obtain S1b which is a linear combination of transmitted signals
n
n
(X3a , X3c ). Now by the two linearly independent observations

n
of (S1a (X3a ), S1b (X3a , X3c )), R1 can resolve (X3a , X3c ) and
thus can decode W3 as well, subject to the noise distortion.
Since the genie information G1 provided to R1 allows it to
decode all three messages, we have:

where (4) follows from Fano’s inequality. (8) holds because

obtain the following three inequalities:

use compact notations R = RΣ /3 and h(X(·) ) = [h(X1(·) ) +
h(X2(·) ) + h(X3(·) )]/3, where quantities without user index

of generic polynomial equations, to classify an alignment
problem as proper if and only if the number of independent
variables in every set of equations is at least as large as
the number of equations in that set. While the polynomial
equations are not strictly generic, they appeal to the intuition
that proper systems are likely to be feasible and improper
systems to be infeasible. For a K user MT × MR MIMO
IC where each user desires d DoF, Cenk et al. identiﬁed
T +M
the system as proper if and only if d ≤ MK+1 R . Recent
works in [7], [8] show that linear interference alignment
is indeed infeasible for improper systems. Also, they show
that if MT = MR or if MT , MR are divisible by d, then
proper systems are feasible. However, the feasibility of proper
systems is in general not known, even for K = 3 users.
Our results in [1] settle the question of feasibility of linear
interference alignment for the 3 user MT × MR MIMO
IC, for all values of MT , MR . Somewhat surprisingly within
this setting, especially considering systems near the threshold
of proper/improper distinction, we show that most proper
systems are infeasible. Speciﬁcally, we show that the linear
interference alignment problem (MT × MR , d)3 (as deﬁned
in previous work by Cenk et al.) is feasible if and only if
d ≤ DoF (M, N ) . For every value of γ = M/N , except for
γ ∈ B = {1/3, 3/5, 5/7, · · · }, we show that there are proper
systems that are not feasible (see the red solid boundary in
Fig.2). As a related result, for every value of γ except γ ∈ B,
there is redundancy either at the transmitter or receiver side,
in the sense that some signal dimensions can be sacriﬁced
without reducing the DoF value. Evidently this redundancy
manifests itself as superﬂuous variables that are not discounted
in the deﬁnition of proper systems, thus creating a discrepancy
between proper and feasible systems.

Now adding up the four inequalities (30) to (33) we have:
12nR ≤ 4N n log ρ + 3nR + n o(log ρ) + o(n).

By arranging terms of (34), dividing log ρ and n on both
sides, and letting ρ → ∞ and n → ∞, we have:
d ≤ 4N/9 = 20/9.

all signals from the outer shell antennas (denoted as a2 , c2 ) of
each user. Intuitively if we remove the two outer shell antennas
at each transmitter and receiver in the 4 × 5 setting, then the
remaining core is the 2 × 3 setting.

V. F EASIBILITY OF L INEAR I NTERFERENCE A LIGNMENT
In the abundance of linear beamforming schemes designed
for MIMO IC, one of the central questions is the feasibility of
linear interference alignment based on only spatial beamforming, i.e., without the need for channel extensions or variations
in time/frequency. The feasibility problem was introduced by
Gomadam, Cadambe and Jafar and they proposed iterative
algorithms to test the feasibility of desired alignments. Recognizing the feasibility problem as equivalent to the solvability of
a system of polynomial equations, Cenk et al. in [6] draw upon
classical results in algebraic geometry about the solvability
