Abstract—A relay channel is one in which a Source and
Destination use an intermediate Relay station in order to improve
communication rates. We propose the study of relay channels
with classical inputs and quantum outputs and prove that
a “partial decode and forward” strategy is achievable. We
divide the channel uses into many blocks and build codes in
a randomized, block-Markov manner within each block. The
Relay performs a standard Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland
quantum measurement on each block in order to decode part
of the Source’s message and then forwards this partial message
in the next block. The Destination performs a novel “slidingwindow” quantum measurement on two adjacent blocks in order
to decode the Source’s message. This strategy achieves non-trivial
rates for classical communication over a quantum relay channel.

quantum aspects of optical communication channels, where
information is encoded into continuous degrees of freedom. It
is known that collective quantum measurements on bosonicchannel outputs outperform classical strategies, particularly in
the low-photon-number regime [11]. In other words, quantum
measurements are necessary to achieve their ultimate capacity.
Ref. [11] also demonstrates that classical encoding is sufﬁcient
to achieve the Holevo capacity of the lossy bosonic channel,
giving further motivation for the theoretical study of classicalquantum models.
In this paper, we develop a “partial decode and forward”
strategy for classical-quantum relay channels. Our results here
are the ﬁrst extension of the quantum simultaneous decoding
techniques used in [8], [9] to multi-hop networks. In the
partial-decode-and-forward strategy given here, the Relay decodes part of the Source’s message in one block and forwards
it in the next. The Destination performs a novel “slidingwindow” quantum measurement to decode both parts of the
Source’s message in two consecutive blocks [12], [2] and in
doing so allows for the Source and Destination to achieve nontrivial communication rates. We state our main result in the
Section II, introduce the necessary background on quantum
systems and quantum decoding in Section III, and give the
proof in Section IV. We conclude and discuss open problems
in Section V.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Suppose that a Source wishes to communicate with a remote
Destination. Suppose further that a Relay is available that can
decode the messages transmitted by the Source during one
time slot and forward them to the Destination during the next
time slot. With the Relay’s help, the Source and Destination
can improve communication rates because the Destination can
decode the intended messages in parallel from the channel
outputs at two consecutive time slots. In this way, useful
information is received both from the Source and the Relay.
The relay channel has been studied extensively in the
context of classical information theory [1], [2], [3]. There,
the discrete memoryless relay channel is modelled as a conditional probability distribution p(y1 , y|x, x1 ), where y1 and
y are the respective outputs at the Relay and Destination
whenever the Source and Relay input symbols x and x1 . Two
important families of coding strategies exist for relay channels:
compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward [1], [3]. The
partial decode-and-forward strategy differs from the decodeand-forward strategy in that it has the Relay decode only part
of the message from the Source [1].
The study of quantum channels with information-theoretic
techniques has been an active area for some time now [4].
Theoretical interest has focused on classical-quantum channels
of the form (X , N X→B (x) ≡ ρB , HB ), where, for each of the
x
inputs x ∈ X , there corresponds an output quantum state, described by a density operator ρB in a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
x
space HB . Classical-quantum channels are a useful abstraction
for studying general quantum channels and correspond to
the transmitters being restricted to classical encodings. In
this setting, single-letter formulas characterize the capacity of
point-to-point [5], [6] and multiple-access channels [7] and
give achievable rates for other network channels [8], [9], [10].
The study of quantum channels ﬁnds practical applications in optical communications. Bosonic channels model the

II. R ESULTS
A classical-quantum relay channel N is a map with two
classical inputs x and x1 and two output quantum systems
B1 and B. For each pair of possible input symbols (x, x1 ) ∈
X × X1 , the channel prepares a density operator ρB1 B deﬁned
x,x1
on the tensor-product Hilbert space HB1 ⊗ HB :
B1
ρx,xB ≡ N XX1 →B1 B (x, x1 ),
1

(1)

where B1 is the Relay output and B is the Destination output.
The theorem below captures the main result of our paper:
Theorem 1 (Partial decode-forward inner bound). Let {ρx,x1 }
be a cc-qq relay channel as in (1). Then a rate R is achievable,
provided that the following inequality holds:
R ≤ max min
p(u,x,x1 )

I(XX1 ; B)θ ,
I(U ; B1 |X1 )θ + I(X; B|X1 U )θ

classical-quantum state θU XX1 B1 B ≡

x,x1

Our code construction employs codebooks {xn },
1
{un }, and {xn } generated according to the distribution
p(x1 )p(u|x1 )p(x|u, x1 ). We split the message for each
block into two parts (m, ) ∈ M × L such that the rate
R = Rm + R . The Relay fully decodes the message and reencodes it directly in the next block (without using binning).
The Destination exploits a “sliding-window” decoding
strategy [12], [2] by performing a collective measurement on
two consecutive blocks. In this approach, the message pair
(mj , j ) sent during block j is decoded from the outputs of
blocks j and j + 1, using an “AND-measurement.”

3) Error analysis: In the context of our coding strategy, we
analyze the average probability of error at the Relay:

We give a proof in the appendix of Ref. [14].
The decoding at the Destination is a variant of the quantum
simultaneous decoder from [8], [9]. To decode the message
(mj , j ), the Destination uses a “sliding-window” decoder,
implemented as an “AND-measurement” on the outputs of
blocks j and j + 1. This coding technique does not require
binning at the Relay or backwards decoding at the Destination
[12], [2].
In this section, we give the details of the coding strategy
and analyze the probability of error at the Destination.

The channel is used for b blocks, each indexed by j ∈
{1, . . . , b}. Our error analysis shows that:
• The Relay can decode the message j during block j.
• The Destination can simultaneously decode (mj , j ) from
a collective measurement on the output systems of blocks
j and j + 1.
The error analysis at the Relay is similar to that of the
Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland theorem [5], [6]. The message j can be decoded reliably, if the rate R obeys the
following inequality:

The error analysis of a square-root measurement is greatly
simpliﬁed by using the Hayashi-Nagaoka operator inequality.

2) Quantum decoding: In a communication scenario, the
decoding operations performed by the receivers correspond
to quantum measurements on the outputs of the channel. A
quantum measurement is a positive operator-valued measure
(POVM) {Λm }m∈M on the system B n . To be a valid POVM,
the set {Λm } of |M| operators should all be positive semideﬁnite and sum to the identity: Λm ≥ 0,
m Λm = I.
Suppose we are given positive operators {Pm }m∈M that
are apt at detecting (Tr[Pm ρm ] ≥ 1 − ) and distinguishing
(Tr[Pm ρm =m ] ≤ ) the output states produced by each message. We can construct a valid POVM (known as the squareroot measurement [5], [6]) by normalizing these operators:
Λm ≡

n
B1(j)

The operators I − Γ j and I − Λmj , j correspond to the
complements of the correct decoding outcomes.

Proof: This follows from a variational characterization of trace distance as the distinguishability of the
states under an optimal measurement M [4]: ρ − σ 1 =

III. P RELIMINARIES
In this section, we introduce the notation used in our paper
and some background information on quantum decoding.
1) Quantum systems: We denote quantum systems as B1
and B and the corresponding Hilbert spaces as HB1 and HB .
We represent quantum states of a system B with a density
operator ρB , which is a positive semi-deﬁnite operator with
unit trace. Let H(B)ρ ≡ −Tr ρB log2 ρB denote the von
Neumann entropy of the state ρB . In order to describe the
“distance” between two quantum states, we use the notion of
trace distance. The trace distance between states σ and ρ is
√
σ − ρ 1 = Tr|σ − ρ|, where |X| = X † X [4]. Two states
can substitute for one another up to a penalty proportional to
the trace distance between them:

Tr [Λρ] ≤ Tr [Λσ] + ρ − σ

Decoding at the Destination. We now determine a decoding POVM that the Destination can perform on the output
systems spanning blocks j and j +1. The Destination is trying
to recover messages j and mj given knowledge of j−1 .
First let us consider forming decoding operators for block

the messages that they encode, and the codewords are implicit.

Finally, we combine the positive operators from (9) and (11)
to form the “sliding-window” positive operator:

During block j +1, the Source transmits (mj+1 , j+1 ) given
, whereas the Relay sends j , leading to the state:
j
ρmj+1 ,

j | j−1

We can then form a positive operator “sandwich”:

Transmission. The transmission of ( j , mj ) to the Destination happens during blocks j and j + 1. At the beginning
of block j, we assume that the Relay has correctly decoded
the message j−1 . During block j, the Source inputs the new
messages mj and j , and the Relay forwards the old message
j−1 . That is, their inputs to the channel for block j are
the codewords xn (mj , j , j−1 ) and xn( j−1 ), leading to the

We proved achievability of the rates given by the partial
decode and forward inner bound, thus extending the study of
classical-quantum channels to multi-hop scenarios. An interesting open question is to determine a compress-and-forward
strategy for the quantum setting. Another avenue for research
would be to consider quantum communication scenarios, and
results here might have applications for the design of quantum
repeaters. I. Savov acknowledges support from FQRNT and

The result of the expectation in z is ρ| j−1 , and we can bound
the expression in { using (19). The ﬁrst inequality follows
because all the other terms in the trace are positive operators
less than the identity. The ﬁnal inequality follows from (18).
