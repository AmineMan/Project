region1 of CARA for the non-identical two-node case. Note
that even for the original ALOHA with static channels, an
exact stability analysis is available only for the two-node case
and only bounds are known for the cases with arbitrary number
of nodes [2]–[7]. This is due to the complicated interaction
between queues, i.e., the service process of a queue depends
on the status of the other queues.
On the other hand, all the above-mentioned results on
CARA assumed the availability of perfect CSI at each node.
In practice, however, the channel states may not be directly
observable but rather needs to be estimated. Subsequently,
errors in estimation will result in the performance degradation,
which is what we focus on in this paper. In [13], the stability
region of CARA with imperfect CSI was obtained for the twonode case but under the simplistic collision channel model. It
also did not obtain the closure of the stability region which is
a common criterion for comparison between different systems.
In this work, an exact characterization of the stability region
of CARA with arbitrary error rates is obtained for the twonode case with a receiver having MPR capability. The obtained
results, therefore, generalize the cases of having perfect CSI
with either the collision channel or the channel with MPR
capability. Unlike the constant MPR model considered in [5]–
[7], the MPR probabilities in our model depend not only on
the set of transmitters but also on their instantaneous channel
conditions. The effect of channel uncertainty on the stability
of CARA is identiﬁed by comparing with the cases of having
perfect CSI and no CSI. Finally, we make a comparison
with the class of stationary scheduling policies which requires
channel state feedback to a centralized controller.

Abstract—In this work, we consider a system with time-varying
channels and random access that exploits the channel state
information (CSI). The CSI is not directly available to each
node but estimated with some errors. An exact stability analysis
is carried out for the considered model when a pair of bursty
sources are competing for a shared channel and the receiver has
multipacket reception capability. The contributions in the paper
are twofold: ﬁrst, we identify the effect of channel estimation
errors on the achievable stability region of the channel-aware
random access protocol. Secondly, we make a comparison with
the class of stationary scheduling policies.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Random access protocols are of interest in distributed
communications due to their simplicity and independence of
centralized controllers. As pointed out in [1], however, most
studies on random access systems are built upon simplistic
physical layer models such as the collision channel which
is too pessimistic and assumes that if more than one nodes
transmit simultaneously, none of them are successful [2]–[4].
The multipacket reception (MPR) model allows successful
reception of simultaneously transmitted packets [5]–[7]. However, the use of channel state information (CSI) is ignored as
the channels are modeled with constant success probabilities
over time.
Exploiting CSI for increasing the network capacity has been
thoroughly investigated for point-to-point links at the physical
layer (see [8] and references therein). The gain from utilizing
the CSI information is due to the multiuser diversity that needs
precise CSI feedback to the centralized controller. This is
a very strong and rather unrealistic requirement. In [9] and
[10], it was shown that a variant of the ALOHA protocol
in the way that the nodes adapt their transmissions based on
the local CSI, called channel-aware random access (CARA),
can signiﬁcantly improve the sum throughput even without
the centralized controller. However, these results were derived
under the simplifying assumption that the users are always
backlogged and experience identically distributed channel conditions. Subsequently, the authors in [11] and [12] extended the
results to the case of bursty sources and derived the stability

II. S YSTEM M ODEL
We consider a time-slotted system consisting of N nodes
transmitting to a common receiver having MPR capability
[5]–[7]. The formulation is for arbitrary N but most of the
results are for N = 2. Each node i has an inﬁnite size
buffer for storing the arriving packets. The packet arrivals
at each queue i are modeled as a Bernoulli process2 of rate
1 This is deﬁned as the set of arrival rate vectors for which the queues in
the network reach their steady state and do not drift to inﬁnity.
2 The results presented in the following sections still hold even when the
processes are arbitrary as long as they are stationary.

λi per slot and the slot duration is equal to the transmission
time of a single packet. The channel state between node i
and the receiver at time slot t is denoted by Ci (t) which is
randomly time-varying between ‘Good’ and ‘Bad’ states, i.e.,
Ci (t) ∈ {G, B}. Let C(t) denote the channel state vector
of the transmitting nodes among {1, . . . , N }. Channels hold
their states for the duration of a slot, and potentially change
on slot boundaries. The channel states at different nodes are
assumed to be independent, but the realizations of a channel at
different times are not necessarily independent of each other.
The channels are stationary and the steady-state probabilities
that channel i is in ‘Good’ and ‘Bad’ states are denoted by
G
B
πi and πi , respectively.
Denote with qi|C(t) the success probability of node i for
a given channel state vector C(t). Since we are considering
the scenario with a common receiver, if one node’s channel
is in ‘Good’ state, then it is likely to interfere with the
other nodes at a higher level. Consequently, for the two-node
case, the MPR probabilities satisfy q1|{G,G} ≤ q1|{G,B} and
q2|{G,G} ≤ q2|{B,G} . We assume throughout the paper that the
success probability when a node’s own channel state is ‘Bad’
is zero regardless of the level of interference. This describes
the situation where its channel is in deep fading and, thus,
the signal-to-noise ratio itself is below a certain threshold for
successful decoding of the transmitted packets.
˜
Denote by Ci (t) the estimated channel state that may not
coincide with the actual state Ci (t). Let us deﬁne the following
˜
probabilities of channel estimation errors: ǫG = Pr[Ci (t) =
i
B
˜i (t) = G|Ci (t) = B], and let
B|Ci (t) = G] and ǫi = Pr[C
¯i
ǫG = 1 − ǫG and ǫB = 1 − ǫB . Denote by ǫi the vector
¯i
i
i
of channel estimation error probabilities of node i, i.e., ǫi =
(ǫG , ǫB ), and let ǫ denote the vector of ǫi for i = 1, . . . , N .
i
i
In each time slot, each node adapts its transmission based
on the estimated channel state in the sense that it attempts
˜
to transmit with probability pi if Ci (t) = G and its queue,
whose length is denoted by Qi (t), is non-empty. Otherwise, it
remains silent. The performance of this adaptation, which was
previously considered in [11]–[13] with perfect CSI, would
highly depend on the accuracy of the channel estimation.
The stability region of a system is deﬁned as the set of
arrival rates λ for which the queues in the system are stable.
Queue i is said to be stable if limt→∞ Pr[Qi (t) < x] = F (x)
and limx→∞ F (x) = 1 [3]. Loynes’ theorem as it relates to
stability plays a central role throughout this paper [14]. It states
that if the arrival and service processes of a queue are strictly
jointly stationary and the average arrival rate is less than the
average service rate, the queue is stable.

Note that for any arrival rate vector inside the stability region,
there exists a transmission probability vector which stabilizes
the system.

III. O N THE S TABILITY R EGION OF CARA
In this section, we present the stability region of CARA
in the presence of channel estimation errors for the two-node
case and compare it to the cases of having perfect CSI and
no CSI. To bypass the coupling among the queues, we use
the stochastic dominance technique [2]. Denote by S(p) the
stability region of CARA for a given transmission probability

right triangle. Otherwise, the region is non-convex.
This corollary can be easily veriﬁed by comparing the slopes
of the lines from PY to P1 and from P2 to PX and those

q2|{G} = 1, the curve (2) shrinks to a point whose coordinate
is identically described by both P1 and P2 and the slopes of
the lines from PY to P1 and from P2 to PX become identical.
Remark 3.1: Consider the case of having perfect CSI, i.e.,
the estimated channel states are always identical to the actual
states. This can be viewed as a special case of our model with
ǫ = 0. By substituting ǫ = 0 into Theorem 3.1, we can obtain
the description for the case of having perfect CSI.
We next consider the case where CSI is not available and
hence a decision on transmission has to be made independently
of the underlying channel state. This corresponds to the
original ALOHA in which each node attempts to transmit
with probability pi regardless of the channel state. Since the
stable throughput and its multi-dimensional stability region is
a steady-state measure of the network performance, it depends
only on the stationary behavior of the system3 . Consider
a system with constant success probabilities that are equal
to the average probabilities experienced in the time-varying
system. Then, the stability regions of the two systems must be
identical, if started from the same initial conditions. Denote
s

with qi and qi respectively the constant success probabilities
seen by node i when it transmits alone or along with the other

node j (= i) for the two-node case and deﬁne ∆i = qi − qi

appears in [7], but is repeated here to keep our treatment selfcontained.

By comparing with the case of having perfect CSI, Fig.
1 shows how the stability region of CARA is affected by the
channel estimation errors. It is obvious that the stability region
of the original ALOHA is always a proper subset of that of
CARA when perfect CSI is available. This complies with the
results obtained in [11]. In the presence of channel estimation
errors, however, this may not be true as shown in the ﬁgure.
This is because the CARA does not allow nodes to transmit
when the observed channel state is bad.
IV. C OMPARISONS WITH C ENTRALIZED S CHEDULERS
In this section, we compare the stability region of CARA
to that achieved by considering all the stationary scheduling
policies which require CSI feedback to the centralized controller. Note that a scheduler allocates each time slot to one
of the nodes such that the scheduled node can transmit in an
interference-free environment during its allocated time slots.
In [15], it was shown that the queue length information can
be further utilized to improve the scheduling performance.
Speciﬁcally, the discovered policy that serves the longest
connected queue (LCQ) among those in ‘Good’ channel state
stabilizes the system whenever the input rate vector is inside
the stability region that is obtained by considering all the
stationary scheduling policies. This is why the LCQ policy is
called throughput-optimal. The following theorem is derived
again for the case with channel estimation errors, which was
originally derived in [15] with perfect CSI.
Theorem 4.1: The necessary and sufﬁcient condition for
stability under all the stationary scheduling policies in the
presence of channel estimation errors is

CARA even with channel estimation errors, we may need
to modify CARA itself which was not considered here. We
also compared the stability region of CARA to that achieved
by centralized schedulers and observed that CARA may
outperform the centralized schedulers as the MPR capability
improves. The stability analysis of CARA had to resolve the
interaction between nodes. Consequently, extending the results
to the general case with an arbitrary number of nodes, i.e.,
N > 2, although highly desirable, presents serious difﬁculties
and was not considered here.

the stability region of CARA to that achieved by centralized
schedulers, and it can be observed that the former is not
necessarily a subset of the latter. Indeed, the relationship
between them depends on parameters such as the channel
estimation error probabilities and the MPR probabilities. Note
that when the stability region of CARA is non-convex, or
convex but with the vertex P3 given in (1) strictly contained
in the stability region achieved by centralized schedulers, then
the region becomes a subset of that achieved by the schedulers.

Pr[Q2 = 0] = 1 −

Otherwise, if the stability region of CARA is convex but
condition (4) does not hold, the stability region of CARA is
not a proper subset of that achieved by centralized schedulers,
i.e., there exists a rate region that can be achieved only by
CARA.

The stability condition for queue 1 given above is not only
sufﬁcient but also necessary in the original system. This can
be proved using the so-called indistinguishability argument
[2]. The sufﬁcient part is trivial which follows from the
construction of the dominant system whose queue sizes, at
all times, at least as large as those in the original system.
The necessary part is argued as follows. If for some λ1 ,
queue 1 saturates, then always a real packet will be chosen
for a transmission, i.e., the dominant system and the original
systems are indistinguishable. Since this statement holds as
long as the input rate vector is strictly outside the stability
region, the boundaries of the two systems must be identical.
The pair of inequalities (8) and (10) describes the ﬁrst
subregion in the lemma. By reversing the roles of the two
nodes in system S1 , we can obtain the other pair of inequalities
which describes the second subregion.

Equations (11) and (12) imply (3). This completes the necessity part of the proof. For the sufﬁciency, we use the Lyapunov
drift argument similar to that used in [15] and the Lyapunov
N

function L(Q) = i=1 qi|{G} Q2 . The details are omitted due
i
to space limitation.

Assume that the system is operating under some stationary
policy and is stable. Denote by Ai (t), Mi (t), and Yi (t) the
number of packets arriving at node i, the indicator function on
the success of the transmission when node i is scheduled, and
the indicator function that is equal to 1 if the actual channel
state of node i is ‘Good’ and estimated correctly. The expectations are given by E[Ai (t)] = λi , E[Mi (t)] = qi|{Ci (t)} , and

and Pr[Ω2 ] > 0 due to the stationarity of the system.
