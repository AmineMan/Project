m × m zero matrix and the m × m identity matrix by 0m and
Im , respectively.
Any polynomial with coefﬁcients over ﬁnite ﬁelds of degree
less than n is uniquely determined by its values at n (or more)
distinct points. This is the famous Lagrange interpolation
polynomials in ﬁnite ﬁelds [15].
Now we generalize the famous formula. First throughout this paper let n be a positive integer and let A =
{A1 , · · · , An } be a subset of Mm (Fq ) such that for any
i ̸= j, Ai  Aj is invertible and Ai Aj = Aj Ai . For example,
−

0 0 1
let A =  1 0 1  be an invertible matrix in M3 (F2 ).
0 1 0
Then {Im , A, A2 , · · · , A6 } is a subset satisfying the above
condition. In addition we suppose that the indeterminate X
can commute with any matrix in Mm (Fq ).

Abstract–In this paper we ﬁrst give the Lagrange
interpolation polynomials in rings of matrices over ﬁnite
ﬁelds and propose a new secret sharing scheme similar to
Shamir’s secret sharing scheme as its direct application
in cryptography. We also introduce the generalized ReedSolomon codes over a noncommutative ring of matrices
over a ﬁnite ﬁeld and study their properties using this
interpolation formula. We show that they are maximum
distance separable (MDS) and present the key equation by
deriving their dual codes and Goppa formulation.
Keywords–Lagrange interpolation formula, codes over
rings, quasi-cyclic codes, polynomial rings over matrix
rings, secret sharing schemes
I. I NTRODUCTION
Lagrange interpolation polynomials in ﬁnite ﬁelds have
many applications such as Shamir’s secret sharing scheme in
cryptography [15] and coding theory [1], [2].
In this paper we generalize Lagrange interpolation polynomials in ﬁnite ﬁelds to those in rings of matrices over
ﬁnite ﬁelds. As its direct application, we propose a new secret
sharing scheme similar to Shamir’s secret sharing scheme.
As we know, Lagrange interpolation formula in ﬁnite ﬁelds
has close relationship with Reed-Solomon codes over ﬁnite
ﬁelds and their generalizations, which are very useful in
practice [8], [12], [17]. In the other hand, many results are
about cyclic codes over rings such as integer residue rings,
chain rings and p-adic rings [3], [4], [13], [14] and about quasicyclic codes [5], [6], [9], [10], [11]. In [7] authors viewed
quasi-cyclic codes over a ﬁnite ﬁeld as cyclic codes over rings
of matrices and proposed a new construction of some quasicyclic codes and self-dual codes.
In this paper we also introduce the generalized ReedSolomon codes over a noncommutative ring of matrices over
a ﬁnite ﬁeld and study their properties using this interpolation
formula. We show that they are maximum distance separable
(MDS) and present the key equation by deriving their dual
codes and Goppa formulation.

Theorem 1: Let A be deﬁned as above. Then there exists
a unique polynomial f (X) with degree less that n, i.e.,
f (X) =

n
∑

Di

i=1

∏
(Ai − Aj )−1 (X − Aj ),
j̸=i

such that
Di = f (Ai ),

1 ≤ i ≤ n.

(1)

Proof: First it is obvious that f (X) satisﬁes (1) with
degree less than n. Assume g(X) ∈ Mm (Fq )[X] also satisﬁes
(1) and its degree is less than n.
Without the loss of generality, we assume the degree of
f (X)−g(X) is n−1. The Euclidean division of f (X)−g(X)
by X − A1 , which is possible because X − A1 is monic, is
f (X) − g(X) = q1 (X)(X − A1 ) + r1 (X),
where deg(r1 (X)) < deg(X − A1 ).
Since f (A1 ) − g(A1 ) = 0m , we have r1 (X) = 0m . For i =
2, · · · , n, we get q1 (Ai ) = 0m since f (Ai ) − g(Ai ) = 0m
and Ai − A1 is invertible.
Similarly we have

OF MATRICES OVER FINITE FIELDS

Let Fq be a ﬁnite ﬁeld where q is a prime power and let
Mm (Fq ) denote the noncommutative ring of m × m matrices
with entries in Fq and Mm (Fq )[X] denote the polynomials
ring with coefﬁcients from Mm (Fq ). In addition, we denote

qn−2 (X) =
This is a contradiction.

q2 (X)(X − A2 )
X − An−1 = X − An

g(Ai ) = Vi−1 Vi−1 f (Ai−1 ) for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Hence the code
is cyclic.
Let f (X) and g(X) be distinct polynomials in
Mm (Fq )[X]k . Set h(X) = f (X) − g(X), and so h(X) ̸= 0
is also of degree less than k and let t be the number of the
roots that h(X) has among {A1 , · · · , An }. The weight of
codeword generated by h(X) must be no less than n − t. By
Theorem 1 we get t ≤ k − 1 and so the minimum distance
∏k−1
must be no less than n − k + 1. Let h(X) = i=1 (X − Ai )
and we can get a codeword of weight n − k + 1. Therefore
the result is required.
As special linear codes, quasi-cyclic codes are the natural generalization of cyclic codes. A linear code C of
length n is called a quasi-cyclic code with index ℓ over
Fq if (cn−ℓ+1 , . . . , cn , c1 , . . . , cn−ℓ ) ∈ C, for any c =
(c1 , . . . , cn ) ∈ C. It is well known that ℓ divides n and so
we write n = mℓ. It is clear that C is cyclic if ℓ = 1.
Let C be a linear code over Mm (Fq ) and c = (c1 , . . . , cn ) ∈
C. So we also can regard c as a codeword over Fq if it is
written as

Based on the above theorem, we can construct a new secret
sharing scheme similar to Shamir’s secret sharing scheme.
Theorem 2: Let A be deﬁned as above and an integer k,
1 ≤ k ≤ n. Let a secret data D ∈ Mm (Fq ). Randomly choose
k − 1 elements C1 , · · · , Ck−1 ∈ Mm (Fq ) and one can get a
polynomial
f (X) = D + C1 X + . . . + Ck−1 X k−1 ,

(2)

where Ck−1 ̸= 0m . Let
Di = f (Ai ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Then the set {D1 , . . . , Dn } is a (k, n)-threshold secret sharing
scheme.
The proof is immediate result of Theorem 1 and so is
omitted here.
III. C ONSTRUCTION OF G ENERALIZED R EED -S OLOMON
CODES OVER RINGS OF MATRICES

In this paper we take Mm (Fq ) as a code alphabet. Let
Mm (Fq )n denote the set of all n-tuples whose components
are from Mm (Fq ), which can be regarded as a free module.
A linear code over Mm (Fq ) is a submodule of Mm (Fq )n .
Similar to the deﬁnition in ﬁnite ﬁeld case, we can deﬁne
the Hamming weight and Hamming distance.

where
denotes the (i, j)th entry of cl for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m
and 1 ≤ l ≤ n.

Deﬁnition 1: Let u ∈ Mm (Fq )n . The Hamming weight of
u, denoted by wt(u), is deﬁned to be the number of nonzero
components of u. The Hamming distance between u and v,
denoted by d(u, v), is wt(u − v).
Let C be a code of length n over Mm (Fq ). The code
C is cyclic if (cn , c1 , . . . , cn−1 ) is also in C for any c =
(c1 , . . . , cn ) ∈ C. The minimum distance of C , denoted by
d(C), is deﬁned as

Corollary 1: The
generalized
Reed-Solomon
code
GRSm,k (A, V) over Mm (Fq ) is quasi-cyclic code over
Fq with index m2 and its minimum distance is at least
nm2 − km2 + m2 .
The proof is forward result of Theorem 3 and is omitted here.
Let y = (y1 , . . . , yn ) and x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) in ∑ m (Fq )n .
M
n
We denote the dot product of y and x by y · x = i=1 yi xi .
If C is an [n, k] linear code over Mm (Fq ), its left dual code
⊥
C of C is deﬁned by

d(C) = min{d(x, y)| x, y ∈ C, x ̸= y}.
Let A be deﬁned as above and V = {V1 , . . . , Vn } be a
subset of Mm (Fq ) such that Vi is invertible for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤
n. For example, we can take V = {Im , . . . , Im }.

⊥

C = {y ∈ Mm (Fq )n | y · x = 0m for x ∈ C}.

Similarly we can deﬁne its right dual code C ⊥ by

Deﬁnition 2: For k, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, we deﬁne the generalized
Reed-Solomon codes over rings of matrices Mm (Fq ) by

C ⊥ = {y ∈ Mm (Fq )n | x · y = 0m for x ∈ C}.

GRSn,k (A, V)
= {(V1 f (A1 ), . . . , Vn f (An ))| f (X) ∈ Mm (Fq )[X]k },

Theorem 4: If V further satisﬁes that Vi B = BVi for
any B ∈ Mm (Fq ) and all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, the left dual
of GRSn,k (A, V) is ⊥ GRSn,k (A, V) = ∏ n,n−k (A, U),
GRS
where U = (U1 , . . . , Um ) with Ui = Vi−1 j̸=i (Ai − Aj )−1 .

where Mm (Fq )[X]k denotes the set of all polynomials in
Mm (Fq )[X] of degree less than k.

Proof: We need to prove that
n
∑
Ui g(Ai )Vi f (Ai ) = 0m

It is clear that GRSn,k (A, V) is a linear code.
Theorem 3: The
generalized
Reed-Solomon
code
GRSn,k (A, V) is a cyclic code with parameters
[n, k, n − k + 1], so it is an MDS code.

(3)

i=1

for any f (X) ∈ Mm (Fq )[X]k and g(X) ∈ Mm (Fq )[X]n−k .
So their product g(X)f (X) has degree at most n − 2. By
Theorem 1, we have
n
∑∏
g(X)f (X) =
(X − Aj )(Ai − Aj )−1 g(Ai )f (Ai ).

Proof: It is obvious that GRSn,k (A, V) has length n and
dimension k.
Secondly, if (V1 f (A1 ), . . . , Vn f (An )) is in GRSn,k (A, V),
by Theorem 1 there exists a unique polynomial g(X) with
degree less than k such that g(A1 ) = V1−1 Vn f (An ) and

i=1 i̸=j

Equation the coefﬁcient of X n−1 from the two sides gives (3)
and so the result is obtained.

Now we drop the subscripts and write S(Z) for the syndrome polynomial.
Clear denominators to get the Key Equation:

Once we have Goppa formulation for for the generalized
Reed-Solomon code GRSn,k (A, V) over Mm (Fq ) and we
suppose that the subset A satisﬁes that Ai B = BAi for all
B ∈ Mm (Fq ), it is easy to get the key equation.
Suppose c = (c1 , . . . , cn ) is a transmitted codeword, r =
(r1 , . . . , rn ) is the received word and e = (e1 , . . . , en ) is the
error pattern. So we have r = c + e. Calculate the syndrome
polynomial of r:
n
∑
Sr (Z) =
Ui (Im − Ai Z)−1 ri (mod Z r ).

Then it is easy to get that
Sr (Z) = Sc (Z) + Se (Z) (mod Z r ),
whence, by Theorem 5, we have
Sr (Z) = Sc (Z) (mod Z r ).
Let B = {i| ei ̸= 0} be the set of error locations. Then we
have the syndrome polynomial
