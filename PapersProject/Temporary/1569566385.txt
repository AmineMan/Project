A COMPARISON OF COMMUNICATION MODELS

Abstract—The generalized deterministic models recently proposed by Niesen and Maddah-Ali [1] successfully capture realinterference alignment as observed in Gaussian models. Simpler
deterministic models, like ADT models [2], cannot demonstrate
this phenomenon because they are limited in the set of channel
gains they can model. This paper reinterprets the Niesen and
Maddah-Ali models through the lens of carry-free operations.
We further explore these carry-free models by considering
i.i.d. unknown fading networks. In the unknown fading context, a carry-free model can be further simpliﬁed to a maxsuperposition model, where signals are superposed by a nonlinear
max operation. Unlike in relay-networks with known fading
and linear superposition, we ﬁnd that decode-and-forward can
perform arbitrarily better than compress-and-forward in maxsuperposition relay networks with unknown fading.

Channel models have always formed the foundation for understanding and engineering wireless communication systems.
The choice of model involves a tradeoff between simplicity
and “distance” from the real-world. Fig. 1 shows a spectrum
of these models. Rayleigh-faded Gaussian models are among
the most commonly used and have undoubtedly furthered the
state-of-the-art in the ﬁeld. However, these models are complex, and this complexity can obscure the essential interaction
between channels and the information ﬂowing through them.

are not just powers of two are essential to capture it. However,
the naive approach leads to a different problem: the “carries”
in the multiplication of the channel gain and the signal break
the bit-wise linearity (and hence the simplicity) of the model.
To circumvent this issue, the models recently proposed by
Maddah-Ali and Niesen [1] ignore these carries to preserve
linearity and yet model generic channel gains. This inspires
us to call these models “carry-free” models. Essentially, these
carry-free models replace a single real channel input by a
discrete valued signal and a real channel gain by an LTI
system (Fig. 2). Sections II and III give details of the carry-free
interpretation of [1]. Section IV deals with MIMO channels.
As a summary, Table I provides a comparison of the
different families of models. While neither ADT nor carryfree models provide direct mappings for individual instances
of Gaussian networks, carry-free models are able to capture
fractional degrees of freedom and real interference alignment.
Armed with this new richer model, Section V attempts
to understand another Gaussian phenomenon: communication
over unknown i.i.d fading channels. A ﬁrst curiosity about such
channels was conjectured in 1969 [5]—even for continuous
fading distributions the optimal input distribution is discrete.
Since then many works have followed up to characterize
unknown point-to-point models [6], [7], [8]. Gaussian channel
capacities in this case behave as log(log SN R), as opposed to
the log SN R scaling for channels with known fading.
However, carry-free models for unknown fading channels
are not deterministic. The input-output relationship in these
models still contains the randomness from the unknown
channel fading. We propose the max-superposition model in
Section V that removes this randomness. The model builds
from the observation that only the highest non-zero bit in
a signal conveys information when the channel is unknown.
The max-model explains how the energy level modulation

Models for wireless media. Carry-free models lie between the
Rayleigh-faded Gaussian and quantization models on one side, and ADT
models on the other.

This led to the development of the simple deterministic “bubble-model” by Avestimehr, Diggavi and Tse (ADT
model) [2], which pictorially represents information ﬂows. The
simplicity of these models led to progress on the relay and
interference channels. However, the same simplicity prevents
them from capturing the interference alignment phenomena
observed in Gaussian fading channels. ADT models only
model gains that are powers of two—they are limited in their
ability to capture real-valued channel gains.
Real interference alignment exploits channel diversity and
channel state information at the transmitter. Channel gains that

scheme, which is optimal in the case of real channels [8],
can in fact be thought of as simple pulse-position-modulation.
A similar fact is true in networks with unknown fading. In the
max-superposition model, superimposed signals are combined
through the non-linear max-operator, as opposed to a linear
sum (hence, the name).
Finally, we note that the max-superposition model of the
relay channel offers a surprise: partial-decode-and-forward can
offer an unbounded gain over compress-and-forward.

D. Truncation
We will use a truncation operation similar to [2], [3], [4]
to capture the effect of noise in a channel. For a polynomial
a(z) = ai z i , we deﬁne a(z) =
ai z i .

III. C ARRY- FREE COMMUNICATION MODELS
A. The point-to-point carry-free model
Consider a real Gaussian point-to-point channel, y =
2n hx + w. h is a ﬁxed realization of a random channel gain
uniform in [0, 1). The noise w is N (0, 1). For simplicity, we
assume signal x has a peak-power constraint of 1 as in [2], and
(2n )2 represents the signal-to-noise ratio (SN R). We develop
a carry-free model for this channel, parallel to the development
of the ADT model, and consider bounded noise.
Considering the binary expansions of h and x, we have
y = 2n (h−1 2−1 + h−2 2−2 + ...)(x−1 2−1 + x−2 2−2 + ...) +
(w−1 2−1 +w−2 2−2 +...). Replacing the binary expansion with
polynomial notation, we get y(z) = z n (h−1 z −1 + h−2 z −2 +
...)(x−1 z −1 +x−2 z −2 +...)+(w−1 z −1 +w−2 z −2 +...), which
we will shorten as y(z) = z n h(z)x(z) + w(z). We can think
of w−i as fair coin ﬂips and write the channel equation as
y(z) = z n h(z)x(z) . Here, h(z) is the channel polynomial,
1
n = 2 log(SN R) and x(z) is the message polynomial. In
matrix form1 this is:

II. C ARRY- FREE OPERATIONS
Just as in [2], the generalized deterministic models of [1]
consider the binary-string representation of real numbers as
a starting point. To interpret these models as “carry-free”
models we deﬁne carry-free arithmetic. Consider such a string
an an−1 ...a1 a0 a−1 .... Let B be the set of all binary strings
of inﬁnite length. We deﬁne carry-free addition, ⊕c , and
multiplication, ⊗c , over B in the obvious way.
A. Addition and Multiplication
Let cn ...c1 c0 c−1 ... = an ...a1 a0 a−1 ... ⊕c bn ...b1 b0 b−1 ....
Then ci = ai + bi , where the sum is over F2 . The addition
operation involves no carryovers unlike in real addition. We
derive the name “carry-free” from this property. Bit interactions at one level do not affect higher level bits.
Let cn ...c1 c0 c−1 ... = an ...a1 a0 a−1 ... ⊗c bn ...b1 b0 b−1 ... .
Then ci = ak bi−k , where the summations are in F2 . Thus,

or y = H · x. Thus, the capacity of the channel is the rank
of the (n − 1) × (n − 1) matrix H, which is determined by
the highest location where hi is non-zero.

B. Real-interference alignment in carry-free models
The crux of real interference alignment lies in understanding
fractional degrees of freedom. A minimal model to understand
this is the multiple-access channel. An interesting question
about fractional degrees of freedom was implicitly posed and
1
answered positively in [9], [10]: can we achieve ( 1 , 2 ) d.o.f.
2
without time-sharing or CSIT2 (channel state information at
transmitters)? This question is answered for carry-free models
by Niesen and Maddah-Ali [1].

B. Signal notation
The bit levels of carry-free numbers are like a fake “time”.
Signals convolve to interact—just as carry-free strings multiply. The string an ...a1 a0 a−1 ... can also be denoted as signal
samples from −∞ to n: a[n]a[n − 1]...a[0]a[−1]....
C. Polynomial notation

1 The triangular structure of this matrix motivates the name lower triangular
models in [1].
2 Successive-decoding schemes in Gaussian models are inherently asymmetric. For instance, consider a scheme where one encoder reduces its power to
√
P while the other transmits at full power P . This requires a pre-coordination
on which encoder must reduce power and is equivalent to a time-sharing
scheme in cooperation burden. The same must occur in ADT models since
the bit shift alignments at the receiver are unknown to the transmitter.

Under the multiplication and addition deﬁned above,
(B, ⊕c , ⊗c ) forms a commutative ring. There is a natural
mapping from this ring to the polynomial ring. an ...a1 a0 a−1 ...
in B corresponds to an z n + ... + a1 z + a0 + a−1 z −1 .... We can
check the natural addition and multiplication in the polynomial
ring is equivalent to ⊕c and ⊗c of B.

This inconsistency between the carry-free model and the
Gaussian model seems to arise from the fact that numbers
behave differently under the two algebras because of the lack
of carryovers. For instance, 5, a prime integer, is composite
in the carry-free ring (101 = 11 ⊗c 11). This is the primary
difﬁculty in building a direct map from Gaussian instances to
their carry-free counterparts.

X2=1

Consider a carry-free MAC with no CSIT: y(z) =
2n h(z)a(z) + 2n h (z)b(z) with n = 1 log(SN R) . In other
2
words, h(z) and h (z) are only known to the receiver, and
transmitters are not allowed any cooperation or common randomness for time-sharing. Clearly, the cut-set bound implies
that the total d.o.f. of the channel is bounded by 1. The
scheme follows [9], [1], and sets the lower order bits to zero
as described in Fig. 3.
Theorem 3.2: Each transmitter can achieve 1 d.o.f. without
2
timesharing or CSIT for almost all channel gains.
Proof: See Niesen and Maddah-Ali [1].
The natural next channel to explore is the X-channel, and
here too, carry-free models can capture the notion of fractional
degrees of freedom as in the Gaussian case, as shown in [1].

This channel has 2 d.o.f under the Gaussian model, but only
one under ADT models. However, carry-free models represent
the channel as h11 (z) = z k−1 +z k−2 , h12 (z) = z k , h21 (z) =
z k , h22 (z) = z k and can capture the 2 d.o.f.
Unfortunately, the carry-free model cannot solve this problem generally. There is no simple correspondence between a
speciﬁc instance of a real 2 × 2 MIMO model and a speciﬁc
carry-free model. Consider the channel

xq is similarly deﬁned.
The key observation is that xq and yq are sufﬁcient statistics
of x(z), y(z) for y(z), x(z) respectively, and this is captured
in the following lemma.

2
form a Markov chain, and I(y(z); x(z)) = I(yq ; x(z)) =
I(yq ; xq ).
The proof of this lemma is simple and omitted for space
constraints. We use the lemma to calculate the capacity of
this channel, Ccf = maxp(x(z)) I(x(z); y(z)).

determinant in the polynomial ring is non-zero. But

1) Point-to-point carry-free model: Consider the carry-free
model for a channel with unknown i.i.d fading as in Fig. 4. The
basic setup builds from earlier sections3 : y(z) = h(z)x(z)
where h(z) = h0 + h−1 z −1 + · · · and x(z) = xn z n +
1
xn−1 z n−1 + · · · + x0 . Here, hi are i.i.d. Bernoulli− 2 random
variables which are unknown to both the transmitter and the
receiver, and xi ∈ {0, 1}.
The ﬁrst thing to note is that this carry-free channel is
not deterministic—the randomness from the fading introduces
randomness in the input-output relationship. Next, observe
that once the maximum bit level in the output is ﬁxed, the
randomness introduced by the channel forces all bits below the
1
maximum level to be Bernoulli- 2 random variables which are
independent from the input. Therefore, we focus our attention
on the highest 1 received in y(z). Deﬁne,

The maximal non-zero bit of the input contaminates output at all lower-levels.
y2 = h0 x2 remains correlated to x(z). However, y1 = h0 x1 + h−1 x2 , is
now a Bernoulli− 1 random variable independent of x(z) if x2 = 1. The
2
same is true for all lower levels of y(z).

has 2 d.o.f. under the real Gaussian model. Under the carryfree model, the channel coefﬁcients are h11 (z) = z 2 +
1, h12 (z) = z + 1, h21 (z) = z + 1, h22 (z) = 1, which
lead to determinant 0.

3 For ease of exposition we adopt slightly different model parameters and
incorporate the channel power gain z n+1 (not z n ) into x(z) and h(z).

The achievable scheme involves using monomials z xq as the
channel input x(z) and parallels pulse-position modulation.
The converse follows from Lemma 5.1.
2) Point-to-point max-model: The observations above suggest that the essence of communicating over unknown fading
channels is captured by the highest non-zero bits of the input
and output. Hence, we propose the max-model, which depends
only on the maximal bit of the signal. Let x ∈ {0, 1, 2 · · · n}
represent the position of the maximal bit in the input signal.
Then, y, the position of the maximal bit in the output signal
is represented as simply as

The very nature of this model suggests that it is not possible
for both encoders to simultaneously communicate information.
Theorem 5.4 below proves that the timesharing rate region is
optimal to within one bit.
Theorem 5.4: The achievable rate region for the maxsuperposition MAC consists of all positive rate pairs (R1 , R2 )
such that

y = x.

log(n2 + 1)(R1 − 1) + log(n1 + 1)(R2 − 1) ≤

log(n2 + 1)R1 + log(n1 + 1)R2 ≤ log(n1 + 1) log(n2 + 1) (7)

Further, this region is tight to within 1 bit for both R1 and
R2 — namely all achievable pairs must satisfy:

(5)

log(n1 + 1) log(n2 + 1)

It is easy to see that the capacity of this channel is Cmax =
log(n + 1).
3) Point-to-point real model: The key point of this section
is to give an intuitive explanation of the log log SN R result for
communication over unknown fading channels. For a channel
with uniform distribution: Y = H · X + W , unknown i.i.d.
fading H ∼ U [0, 1], input power constraint E[X 2 ] ≤ P and
noise W ∼ U [0, 1].
The optimal achievable scheme for this channel is to modulate the energy-level, and there are n = log P of those
available. The different signal values (logarithmically spaced)
which are used as inputs can be thought of as pulse-positions
for standard pulse-position-modulation. The observation that
log |Y | + is an approximate sufﬁcient statistic for Y , clearly
illustrates the insight and applicability of the max-model to
this problem.

3) The real MAC: Consider the real valued MAC:
Y = H · A + H · B + W , with H, H and W are independent U [0, 1] and unknown at the transmitter and receiver, and
A, B are subject to quadratic power constraints P1 and P2 .
The maximum bit-levels n1 , n2 from the carry free model are
equal to n1 = log P1 , n2 = log P2 . Like the max-superposition
MAC, we can prove a theorem similar to Thm. 5.4 and prove
that timesharing is approximately optimal.

B. Multiple-access channel with unknown i.i.d fading
1) The carry-free MAC: Next we move to the carryfree unknown MAC. y(z) = h(z)a(z) + h (z)b(z) where
h(z) = h0 + h−1 z −1 + · · · and h (z) = h0 + h−1 z −1 + · · ·
are unknown at the transmitter and receiver. Let
a(z) = an1 z n1 + · · · + a0 and b(z) = bn2 z n2 + · · · + b0 ,
and yq , aq , and bq are deﬁned as in the previous section.
Just as in the point-to-point case, the randomness introduced
by the fading restricts the information communicated across
the channel to the maximal power level over the two input
signal, and yq depends only on max{aq , bq }. This intuition is
captured in Lemma 5.3. We omit the proof.

0 ≤ i ≤ max{aq , bq } and P (yq = −1) = 2
.
Further,
a(z), b(z)—aq , bq —max{aq , bq }—yq —y(z)
form
a
Markov
chain.
Hence,
I(y(z); a(z), b(z)) = I(yq ; a(z), b(z)) = I(yq ; aq , bq ).
Just as in the point-to-point case, Lemma 5.3 suggests a
deterministic model, described in the next section.
2) The max-superposition MAC: Finally, we come to the
example which gives the max-superposition model its name.
Let a, b ∈ {0, 1, 2 · · · n} represent the highest non-zero bits of
the two input signals in a MAC. Then the output, y, of the
channel depends only on the maximum of the two signals:
y = max{a, b}.

At ﬁrst glance, it would seem that there is no point to
even thinking about coordination or beam-forming style gains
by the relays in an unknown fading network. Compress-andforward seems like the right approximately optimal scheme.
However, this section gives an example of a relay network
where surprisingly, partial-decode-and-forward can inﬁnitely
outperform compress-and-forward style schemes, and there is
a signiﬁcant coordination gain—traditionally known as beamforming gain—to be exploited. This observation is quite interesting when we remind ourselves that the beam-forming gain
is usually bounded by a constant in known-fading Gaussian
networks with linear superposition, and compress-and-forward
is the optimal in linear ADT relay networks [2]. 4
4 It was already known that partial-decode-and-forward is also optimal in
semi-deterministic single-relay channels [11].

In the previous section, we saw that the max operation
essentially captures superposition in i.i.d. unknown fading
networks. We focus on a speciﬁc max-superposition relay
network shown in Fig. 5. Channels connecting X1 to Y1
and X2 to Y2 are orthogonal noiseless links with rate R
each. The MIMO channel connecting X3 , X4 to Y3 , Y4 is
a max-superposition deterministic model. We consider X3 ∈
{0, 1, · · · , n}, X4 ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n} and

The shifted max-operation captures the difference between the
direct-link and cross-link gains in the original Gaussian MIMO
channel. The cross links are weaker than the direct links, but
not by much in a proper scaling.
√
First, observe that when X3 − X4 ≥ n, Y3 = X3 and
√ +
n ) . Thus, both the received signals only
Y4 = (X3 −
depend on X3 , and X4 is useless. Moreover, when X3 and
X4 are independent and their ranges are large, with high
probability the difference between X3 and X4 is greater than
√
n and both Y3 and Y4 only depend on either X3 or X4 .
Therefore, in compress-and-forward (where X3 and X4 are
chosen independently), the throughput is essentially bounded
by log n which is the maximum entropy of a single input.
However, decode-and-forward can exploit the coordination
gain between X3 and X4 . We can keep the difference within
√
n and let Y3 , Y4 depend on both X3 , X4 . The key observa√
tion is that when the quotients of X3√X4 divided by
,
n are
the same, X3 , X4 have to be within n. To keep the quotients
the same, we transfer a common message m0 to both relays
as the common quotient.
An approximately optimal partial-decode-and-forward
scheme is described in Fig. 5. The transmitter divides the

message into three parts m0 , m1 , m2 ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n − 1}.
The common message m0 is sent to both relays and used as
a quotient. The private messages m1 and m2 are transmitted
to Rel1 and Rel2 respectively and used √ remainders. In
as
other words, X3 and X4 are chosen as
n m0 + m1 √
and
√
n m0 + m2 respectively. Since the signals are within n,
Y3 and Y4 also have to equal X3 and X4 (eqs. (9), (10)).
√
Moreover, since the ranges of m0 , m1 , m2 are
n , the
achievable rate of this partial-decode-and-forward can increase
to 3 log n.

We summarize our understanding in Thm. 5.5 and Fig. 6.
The real-channel counterparts are not hard to derive.
Theorem 5.5: Let Crel be the capacity of the relay channel
given as above. The cut-set bound gives the upperbound

capacity is only achievable by partial-decode-and-forward, not by compressand-forward. Therefore, the gap between the two goes to inﬁnity as n grows.

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we explore carry-free models and their various
applications. The ability of carry-free models to capture diverse channel gains illustrates how real-interference alignment
works in Gaussian models. This diversity also allows us to
model unknown fading. We also observe that in unknown
fading networks the carry-free models can be further simpliﬁed to max-superposition models. These max-superposition
networks show a curious property—arbitrarily large “beamforming” like gains—that needs more exploration.
