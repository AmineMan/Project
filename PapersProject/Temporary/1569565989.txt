Recently, information theoretic security has gained signiﬁcant
attention, provisioning an ultimate goal of guaranteed security
against adversaries with unlimited computational resources. The
foundations of physical layer secrecy have been initially developed in [1], [2] and different variants of the problem -mainly for
the wireless channel- have been revisited vastly. For example,
in [3] channel fading has been exploited for secrecy, and more
recently, multiple antennas [4] and cooperative relays [5] have
been utilized to increase the achievable secrecy rates. Despite
the signiﬁcant volume of work in information theoretic secrecy,
most of work has focused on physical layer techniques and on a
single link. The area of wireless theoretic secrecy remains in its
infancy, especially as it relates to the design of wireless networks
and its impact on network control and protocol development.
To that end, we investigated [6] the cross-layer resource
allocation problem with information theoretic security. There,
we considered a system in which nodes collect both open and
private information, store them in separate queues and transmit
them to the base station over block fading uplink channels. We
ﬁrst introduced the concept of private opportunistic scheduling
and showed that it achieves the maximum sum private rate
achievable. We subsequently developed a joint ﬂow control and
scheduling scheme and showed that it achieves a performance,
close to the optimal. In [6], we assumed a constant power
transmission and that information is encoded over individual
packets. In this paper, we extend our results to the scenario
with hybrid ARQ (HARQ) transmission based on incremental
redundancy (INR), which basically relies on mutual information
accumulation. Furthermore, we include the possibility that nodes
transmit at varying power levels, subject to an average power
constraint. We assume that the transmitter has an estimate of its
uplink channel and only the distribution of the cross channels to
the every other node. We develop a dynamic cross-layer control
scheme which maximizes aggregate utility subject to power and

base

privacy constraints. We prove the optimality of our scheme by
Lyapunov optimization theory. Finally, we numerically characterize the performance of the dynamic control algorithm with
respect to several network parameters.
The HARQ transmission scheme we use is similar to the
one employed in [10], which considers a block fading wiretap channel with a single source-destination pair and an (external) eavesdropper and develops sequences of Wyner codes
to be transmitted in subsequent transmissions of a block of
information. The main challenge of incorporating information
encoding across many blocks into our solution was that, it is not
possible to dynamically update the resource allocation, based on
the amount of information leakage to the other nodes at each
retransmission, since the amount of leakage is unknown to the
transmitting node. Furthermore, the privacy outage probability of
subsequent retransmissions of a given block cannot be decoupled
from each other, eliminating the possibility of using standard
Lyapunov techniques. We resolve that issue by utilizing the
Markov inequality so that the desired decoupling occurs at the
expense of some loss in performance. We believe our new
technique contributes to the ﬁeld of network control [7], [8],
since it enables the use of Lyapunov techniques in the analysis
of the schemes such as HARQ, which is based on encoding
information over many blocks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the system model and provides a brief summary of
INR HARQ. Section III gives the problem formulation. In Section IV, we give our joint ﬂow and scheduling algorithm. Lastly,
Section V contains the numerical results of the effect of system
parameters on the performance of the algorithm. Section VI
concludes this work by summarizing the contributions.

Abstract—We consider the problem of resource allocation in a
wireless cellular network, in which nodes have both open and
private information to be transmitted to the base station over block
fading uplink channels. We develop a cross-layer solution, based
on hybrid ARQ transmission with incremental redundancy. We
provide a scheme that combines power control, ﬂow control, and
scheduling in order to maximize a global utility function, subject
to the stability of the data queues, an average power constraint,
and a constraint on the privacy outage probability. Our scheme
is based on the assumption that each node has an estimate of its
uplink channel gain at each block, while only the distribution of the
cross channel gains is available. We prove that our scheme achieves
a utility, arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility given
the available channel state information.

Multiuser uplink communication system

Network Model: We consider a multiuser uplink network as
illustrated in Fig. 1. The system consists of multiple nodes and a
base station. The trafﬁc injected by each of these nodes, consists
of both open and private packets. Nodes wish to transmit those
packets to the base station via the uplink channel, which we will
refer to as the main channel. All private messages of each node
need to be transmitted to the base station, privately from the other
nodes. They overhear transmissions from the transmitting node
over the cross channels. Hence, nodes will treat each other as
“internal eavesdroppers” when transmitting private information.
We assume the time to be slotted. Over each block (of time),
the amount of open information, Ao (k), and private information,
j

A p (k) injected in the queues at node j are both chosen by node
j
j at the beginning of each block. Private and open packets
ˆj
ˆj
have a ﬁxed size R p and Ro respectively. Open and private
information are stored in separate queues with sizes Qo (k)
j
and Q p (k) respectively. At any given block, only one node
j
transmits either open or private information (but not both) and
a scheduler decides on which node will transmit. In addition,
the scheduler decides the transmission powers for private and
open transmission, which are denoted by Pj (k) and Pjo (k) for
user j’s private and open transmissions, respectively. We use
indicator variables, I jo (k) and I jp (k), which take on a value 0
or 1, depending on whether or not open or private information
is transmitted by node j over block k.
Channel Model: We assume the block length to be identical to
N channel uses. Both the main and the cross channels experience
independent identically distributed (i.i.d) block fading, in which
the channel gain is constant over a block and it is varying
independently from block to block. We denote the instantaneous
achievable rate for the main channel of node j and the cross
channel between nodes j and i by R j (k) and R ji (k) respectively.
Even though our results are general for all channel state distributions, in numerical evaluations, we assume all channels to
be Rayleigh fading. Let h j (k) and h ji (k) be power gains of the
main channel for node j and the cross channel between node
j and node i, respectively. We normalize the power gains such
that the additive Gaussian noise has unit variance. Then, the
instantaneous achievable rates are,
R j (k) = log (1 + Pj (k)h j (k))
(1)
R ji (k) = log (1 + Pj (k)h ji (k)) .
(2)
Similarly, the instantaneous achievable rate for the uplink channel of node j for open messages, Ro (k) is:
j
Ro (k) = log 1 + Pjo (k)h j (k) .
j

(3)

We assume that the transmitter has access to a noisy estimate of
its main channel gain and merely the distribution of its crosschannel gains. After each transmission, the base station informs
the transmitting node about the amount of mutual information
accumulated over that block, i.e., R j (k) or Ro (k).
j
Coding: We assume that a ﬁxed INR HARQ scheme is employed
at each node. We ﬁrst explain the details of the version of the
ˆj
scheme for private packets: Node j collects each packet of R p

bits1 and encodes it into a codeword xMN called the mother
j
code, which is then divided into individual groups symbols,
N N
N
[x1 , x2 , . . . , xM ], of length N channel uses. The mother code is
ˆ
ˆj
encoded by using Wyner code of C(R j /M, R p /M, MN), which
ˆ
N R j to convey privacy message
denotes a Wyner code of size 2
ˆp
set W j = (1, 2, ..., 2N R j ) [1]. After the partitioning is realized, the
ﬁrst transmission of the packet forms a codeword of Wyner code
ˆ ˆj
C(R j , R p , N). At the possible mth transmission, the combined
N N
N
codewords, [x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ] form a codeword of length mN as
p
ˆ
ˆ
C R j /m, R j /m, mN . The maximum number of retransmissions
is M and we assume that M is sufﬁciently large to keep the
probability of decoding failure due to exceeding the maximum
number of retransmissions approximately identical to zero. At
ˆ
that, if I jp (k) = 1 and the size of the private queue is smaller than R p ,
j
ˆ
then the transmitter uses dummy bits to complete it to R p .
j
1 Note

each retransmission, base station combines the codeword of
length N with the previously transmitted codewords of the same
packet. For a packet with content W j , let the vector of symbols
N
N
received by node i = j be Yi = [Yi,1 , ...,Yi,m ] at the end of
th retransmission of the packet by node j. To achieve perfect
m
privacy, the following constraint must satisﬁed by node j, for all
i = j.
1
I(W j ; Yi ) ≤ ε , ∀ε > 0.

mN
ˆj
Note that the amount, R p , of encoded private information and
ˆ j of bits that encapsulate the private information
the amount, R
is ﬁxed and do not change from one packet to another. For INR,
the mutual information accumulation for the l th private packet
in the main channel and eavesdropper channels over block n can
be found (as detailed in [10]) as:
Dlj (n) =

n

∑

log 1 + Pj (k)h j (k)I jp (k)

(5)

log 1 + Pj (k)h ji (k)I jp (k)

(6)

k=nl−1 +1
j

Dlji (n) =

n

∑
k=nl−1 +1
j

respectively, where nl−1 is the block index at which the (l − 1)st
j
private packet is successfully decoded by the base station. Note
ˆ
that, if R j < Dlj (n) at block n, we say that the successful decoding
of the private packet took place.
If the accumulated information at one of eavesdroppers exˆ
ˆj
ceeds R j − R p , perfect privacy constraint (4) is violated and we
say that the privacy outage occurs. Then, the privacy outage
probability over block n for the l th private packet is calculated
as:
ˆ
ˆj
(7)
ρ jp,l (n) = P R j − R p < max Dlji (n) .
i= j

For the case of open transmission, at the transmitter, the
information and CRC bits are encoded by a mother code [9].
In each transmission, only the systematic part of the codeword
and a selected number of parity bits are transmitted. Decoding
is attempted at the receiver side by combining all previously
transmitted codes. This procedure is again called INR HARQ,
and mutual information accumulated for the l th private packet in
the main channel of user j over block n is
Dl,o (n) =
j

n

∑

log 1 + Pjo (k)h j (k)I jo (k) ,

(8)

k=nljo −1 +1

where nljo −1 corresponds to the block index, where the (l − 1)st
open message is successfully decoded by the base station. Here,
we assume that ﬁxed length packets are encoded with a rate of
ˆj
Ro , and arrive to the open queue at node j. If the accumulated
ˆj
information is larger than the ﬁxed rate, i.e., Ro < Dl,o (n), the
j
decoding of the open message is successful.
III. P ROBLEM F ORMULATION
In this section, we formulate the problem as a network utility
maximization (NUM) problem. Our objective is to choose the
admission rate and transmission power in order to achieve a long
term private and open rates close to the optimal, while keeping
the rate of privacy outages below a certain level.
Let U jp (x) and U jo (x) be the utilities obtained by node j from
the transmission of x private and open bits respectively. We assume that U jp (·) and U jo (·) are non-decreasing concave functions

and the utility of a private information is higher than the utility
of open transmission at the same rate, i.e., U jp (x) > U jo (x). In
addition, it is assumed that the arrival processes are ergodic.
To state the problem clearly, we deﬁne the expected service
and the expected arrival rates of the private and open queues at
each node as follows. First, the amount of private information
p
R p (k)
j

transmitted from node j in block k is
ˆp
Rj
ˆ
Rj

ˆ
Rj
ˆ R (k),
Rj j

since

is the fraction of the private information encapsulated within

R j (k) bits of transmitted data. Let µ jp and µ o denote the expected
j
service rates of private and open trafﬁc queues, respectively,
i.e., µ jp = E I jp (k)R p (k) and µ o = E I jo (k)Ro (k) . Note that,
j
j
j
the “effective” expected rate of private information received at
the base station without a privacy outage is µ jp,e . Hence, node
j effectively obtains an utility of U jp (µ jp,e ) from its private
transmissions. We assume that the utility gained by a packet
suffering a privacy outage reduces from that of a private packet
to that of an open packet. Thus, node j obtains an utility of
U jo (x p − µ jp,e + xo ) from all transmitted open messages as well
j
j
as the messages that have been encoded privately, but have
undergone a privacy outage. Finally, let the expected arrival rate
to the private queue of node j be x p E A p (k) and the expected
j
j

j

arrival rate to the open queue of node j be

in (10) ensure the stability of private and open queues,
respectively; (11) corresponds to the privacy outage constraint,
which ensures that portion of private packets intercepted by
the eavesdroppers is below of some threshold, γ j , and (12)
correspond to average power constraint.
The challenge in our problem lies in the fact that, the objective
functions of the nodes are coupled. In other words, the private
utility function of each node depends on scheduling decision,
which inevitably affects all the utilities in the system. In order
to decouple utilities obtained by each user from their private
transmissions, we introduce an auxiliary variable x p,e for each
j
variable µ jp,e . By introducing auxiliary variables, we add a new
set of constraints and the optimization problem becomes:

Note that
in (15) can be interpreted as the long term average arrival rate for packets which do not incur privacy outage.
Thus, the portion of packets, kept private from eavesdroppers

should be greater than 1 − γ j . Also note that since objective
function is an increasing function of x p,e (15) is satisﬁed with
j
equality at the optimal point.
IV. DYNAMIC C ONTROL
In this section, we present an opportunistic scheduling algorithm maximizing the total expected utility of network while
satisfying the constraints (14)-(17). In the following, we assume
that there is an inﬁnite backlog of data at the transport layer of
each node providing both private and open messages. The private
ˆ ˆj
messages are encoded by Wyner code at a ﬁxed rate (R j , R p ).
However, the challenge here is that the privacy outage probability in (7) depends on the past transmissions and the scheduling
decision may affect future transmissions, i.e., the events that
successful decoding occurs by an eavesdropper over subsequent
retransmissions are non-iid. Then, utilizing standard Lyapunov
optimization techniques [12] to solve our problem is not possible.
To address this issue, we need to quantify the privacy outage
probability over each block independently. For that purpose, we
make use of Markov’s inequality:
ˆ
ˆ
P R j − R p < max Dlji (n) ≤
j

maxi= j E Dlji (n)

(18)

where (18) follows from Markov inequality, and (19) is due to
the fact that maxi= j E Dlji (n) < ∑i= j E Dlji (n) , since Dlji (n) is
a positive random variable. Recall that Dlji (n) is the accumulated
information at the eavesdropper i. According to the Markov
inequality, the fraction of private packets that suffer a privacy
1
outage is thus upper bounded by R −R p ∑i= j E [R ji (k)] for any
ˆj ˆ
j
block k. Hence, Markov inequality enables us to quantify the
amount of information leakage to the other nodes independently
p
ˆ
Rj
ˆ ˆp
R j −R j

∑i= j E [R ji (k)]. However, since
the Markov inequality is merely a bound, the constraint set over
which we solve the problem shrinks. Hence some performance
is sacriﬁced. In the simulations, we numerically analyze the
amount of shrinkage in the constraint set due to the use of the
Markov inequality and show that it is not signiﬁcant under most
scenarios.
The dynamics of private and open trafﬁc queues, Q p (k) and
j
o (k) respectively, are given as follows:

are stabilized the constraints are also satisﬁed.

where virtual queues in (22-24) represent the constraints in
(15-17) respectively. In addition, R p,e (k) denotes the private

we obtain R p,e (k) as R p (k) −

term corresponds to the amount of information received by the
base station and the second term to the amount of information
captured by the eavesdroppers.
Control Algorithm: The algorithm executes the following steps
in each block k:
(1) Flow control: For some V > 0, each node j injects A p (k),
j
and Ao (k) bits to respective queues and update the virtual
j
queue with A jp,e . Note that A jp,e (k) can be interpreted as
private bits for which perfect secrecy constraint is intended
to be satisﬁed.

j

can obtain a bound for the difference (Q p (k + 1))2 − (Q p (k))2

and also for other queues to obtain the result (26).
We now present our main result showing that our proposed
dynamic control algorithm can achieve a performance arbitrarily
close to the solution of the problem with the outage constraint
tightened via Markov’s inequality.

(2) Scheduling: At any given block, scheduler chooses which
node will transmit and the amount of power used during
transmission of private messages. In other words, schedule
node j and transmit privately encoded (I jp = 1), or open
bits (I jo = 1), with transmit power Pj and Pjo :

the algorithm can be shown using the Lyapunov optip

V. N UMERICAL R ESULTS
In our numerical experiments, we consider a network consisting of four nodes and a single base station. The main channel
between the node and the base station, and the cross-channels
between nodes are modeled as iid Rayleigh fading Gaussian
channels. The power gains of the main and cross-channels are
exponentially distributed with means uniformly chosen in the
intervals [25,50], [0.5,1.5], respectively. The main channel power
gain is estimated by an unbiased estimator based on the a priori
channel measurements. As discussed in [11], the estimation error
of such an estimator, e j (k) can be modeled with a zero mean
ﬁnite variance Gaussian random variable, i.e., e ji (k) ∼ N (0, σ 2 )
for all k. We take σ = 1. In addition, we assume only the
knowledge of distribution for the cross-channel gains.
We consider logarithmic private and open utility functions
where the private utility is κ times more than open utility
at the same rate. More speciﬁcally, for a scheduled node j,
U jp (k) = κ · log(1 + R p (k)), and U jo (k) = log(1 + Ro (k)). We take

κ = 5 in all experiments. We perform the simulation over ﬁve

realizations of R j , Ro and R p . R j and Ro are uniformly chosen
ˆ p in the interval [5, 10]. The rates
in the interval [15, 25] and R j
depicted in the graphs are per node arrival and service rates
ˆ
ˆj
averaged over all realizations of R j and R p , i.e., the unit of
the plotted rates are bits/channel use/node. All nodes have the
same privacy outage probability γ . Recall that the private packets
suffering privacy outage gains a utility of open packets. Thus, in
all ﬁgures, these packets are considered as open services.
In Fig. 2(a), we investigate the effect of the tolerable privacy
outage probability. It is interesting to note that private service rate
increases with increasing tolerable outage probability, γ . This is
due to the fact that for low γ values, the privacy outage condition
is very tight, and this condition is satisﬁed by transmitting
infrequently only when the channel is at its best condition and
with low transmit power. The highest private service rate is
realized when γ = 0.3, which suggests that 30% of the private
packets undergo privacy outage. In Fig. 2(b), the effect of average
power constraint, α is investigated. As expected, for a tight

power constraint, all rates are lower, since selected powers are
smaller. The highest rates are obtained when α = 1, and after
α = 1, the power constraint becomes inactive, since the variance
of the estimation error increases with the power. In addition,
the bound on privacy outage probability obtained by Markov
inequality is 0.24, which is obtained by averaging the resulting
values of the bound over all simulations, whereas the privacy
outage probability calculated as in (7) is approximately 0.18. In
most of the scenarios, this difference is not signiﬁcant as long
as privacy outage constraint is satisﬁed.
VI. C ONCLUSION
We consider the problem of resource allocation in a wireless
cellular network, in which nodes have both open and private
information to be transmitted to the base station over block fading uplink channels. We have developed a cross-layer dynamic
control algorithm in the presence of imperfect knowledge based
on hybrid ARQ transmission with incremental redundancy. We
explicitly took into account the privacy and power constraints
and prove the optimality of our scheme by Lyapunov optimization theory. The main challenge that we faced is that, due to
encoding of information across many blocks, the privacy outage
probability of subsequent retransmissions of a given block cannot
be decoupled from each other. We overcame this challenge by
introducing a novel technique based on the Markov inequality.

Thus, by rearranging the terms in (28) it is easy to observe that
our proposed dynamic network control algorithm minimizes the
right hand side of (28) with the available channel information.
Assume that there exists a stationary scheduling and rate
control policy that chooses the users and their transmission
powers independent of queue backlogs and only with respect to
the channel statistics. Let U ∗ be optimal value of the objective
function of the problem (13) by the stationary policy. Also let
x p,e∗ , x p∗ and xo∗ be optimal effective private, private and open
j

j
trafﬁc arrivals. In addition, let Pj∗ be optimal transmission power
for user j. Note that, the expectations of right hand side (RHS) of
(28) can be written separately due to independence of backlogs
with scheduling and rate control policy. Since the rates and
transmission power are strictly interior of the feasible region,
the stationary policy should satisfy the following:
E I jp (k)R p (k) ≥ x p∗ + ε1 , E I jp (k)Ro (k) ≥ xo∗ + ε2
j
j

E I jo (k)R p,e (k) ≥ x p,e∗ + ε3 , E I jp (k)Pj (k) − I jo (k)Pjo (k) ≤ α j + ε4
j
j
x p,e∗ ≥ (1 − γ j )x p∗ + ε5
j
j

(29)

Recall that our proposed policy minimizes RHS of (28), hence,
any other stationary policy has a higher RHS value. By using
optimal stationary policy, we can obtain an upper bound for the
RHS of our proposed policy. Inserting (29) into (28) and using
the independence of queue backlogs with scheduling and rate
policy, we obtain the following bound:

Now, we can obtain bounds on performance of the proposed
policy and the sizes of queue backlogs as given in Theorem 1.
