channel input and output) and establish another lower bound
on the distortion via the inequality RQ (D) ≤ CQ that stems
from the DPI of IQ . While this lower bound obviously cannot
be tighter than its classical counterpart in the limit of long
blocks (which is asymptotically achievable), Ziv and Zakai
have demonstrated that for short block codes sharper lower
bounds can be obtained.
Gurantz, in his M.Sc. work [5] (supervised by Ziv and
Zakai), continued the work in [17] at a speciﬁc direction:
He constructed a special class of generalized information
functionals deﬁned by iteratively alternating between applications of convex functions and multiplications by likelihood
ratios. After proving that this functional obeys a DPI, Gurantz
demonstrated how it can be used to improve on the Arimoto
bound for coding above capacity [1] and on the Gallager upper
bound of random coding [4] by a pre-factor of 1/2.
Motivated by the interesting nested structure of Gurantz’
information functional, we continue to investigate this information measure, ﬁrst of all, in general, on its own right, and
then we further study its potential. We begin by putting the
Gurantz’ functional in the broader perspective of the other
information measures of [15], [17] (Section 2). Speciﬁcally,
we show that these GMI’s can be viewed as special cases of the
one in [15], which is based on multivariate convex functions.
We then focus on a concrete choice of the convex functions
(Section 3) in the Gurantz’ information measure which turn
out to yield an extension the notion of the Bhattacharyya
distance: While the ordinary Bhattacharyya distance is based
on the geometric mean of two replicas of the channel’s
conditional distribution (see, e.g., [12, eq. (2.3.15)]), the more
general measure considered here, allows an arbitrary number
of replicas. This generalized Bhattacharyya distance is also
intimately related to the Gallager function E0 (ρ, Q) [4], [12],
which is indeed another GMI [3] obeying a DPI (see also [7,
Proposition 2]).
Finally, we apply the DPI, induced by the above described
generalized Bhattacharyya distance, to a detailed study of
lower bounds on parameter estimation under additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and show that in certain cases,
tighter bounds can be obtained by using more than two

Abstract—We study data processing inequalities (DPI’s) that
are derived from a certain class of generalized information
measures, where a series of convex functions and multiplicative
likelihood ratios are nested alternately. A certain choice of the
convex functions leads to an information measure that extends
the notion of the Bhattacharyya distance: While the ordinary
Bhattacharyya distance is based on the geometric mean of
two replicas of the channel’s conditional distribution, the more
general one allows an arbitrary number of replicas. We apply
the DPI induced by this information measure to a detailed study
of lower bounds of parameter estimation under additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and show that in certain cases, tighter
bounds can be obtained by using more than two replicas. While
the resulting bound may not compete favorably with the best
bounds available for the ordinary AWGN channel, the advantage
of the new lower bound, becomes signiﬁcant in the presence of
channel uncertainty, like unknown fading. This is explained by
the convexity property of the information measure.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In classical Shannon theory, DPI’s (in various forms) are
frequently used to prove converses to coding theorems and to
establish fundamental properties of information measures, like
the entropy, the mutual information, and the Kullback–Leibler
divergence. For example, the converse to the joint source–
channel coding theorem sets the stage for the separation
theorem: When a source with rate–distortion function R(D)
is transmitted across a channel with capacity C, the distortion
at the decoder must obey R(D) ≤ C, or equivalently,
D ≥ R−1 (C).
Ziv and Zakai [17] (see also Csisz´ r [3] for related work)
a
have observed that in order to obtain a wider class of DPI’s,
the (negative) logarithm function, that plays a role in the
classical mutual information, can be replaced by an arbitrary convex function Q. This generalized mutual information
(GMI), IQ (X; Y ), was further generalized in [15] to be based
on multivariate convex functions. In analogy to the classical
converse to the joint source–channel coding theorem, one
can then deﬁne a generalized rate–distortion function RQ (D)
(as the minimum of the GMI between the source and the
reproduction, s.t. some distortion constraint) and a generalized
channel capacity CQ (as the maximum GMI between the

1

replicas (Section 4). While the resulting lower bound may
still not compete favorably with the best available bounds
for the ordinary AWGN channel, the advantage of the new
lower bound becomes apparent in the presence of channel
uncertainty, like the case of an AWGN channel with unknown
fading. This different behavior is explained by the convexity
property of the information measure.

According to [15, Theorems 3.1 and 5.1], the following
is true: Let U → X → Y be a Markov chain and
let V = g(Y ) where g is a deterministic function. Let
µi (x, y), i = 1, 2, . . . , k, be arbitrary measures and deﬁne
µi (u, y) = PU (u) dxPX|U (x|u)µi (x, y)/PX (x), µi (u, v) =
dyµi (u, y), i = 1, . . . , k. Then, IZZ (X; Y ) ≥
y: g(y)=v
IZZ (U ; V ). Assuming, in addition, that the encoder x = f (u)
is deterministic, we can choose (following [15]) µi (x, y) =
PX (x)PY |X (y|xi ), where xi = f (ui ) is a speciﬁc member in
X and then µ(y|ui ) = PY |X (y|f (ui )). We then obtain (see
[10] for details):

II. P RELIMINARIES AND BASIC O BSERVATIONS
In [5], a generalized information functional was deﬁned in
the following manner: Let X and Y be random variables
taking on values in alphabets X and Y, respectively. Let
x1 , x2 , . . . , xk be a given list of symbols (possibly with repetitions) from X . Let Q1 , Q2 , . . . , Qk be a collection of univariate functions, deﬁned on the positive reals, with the following
properties, holding for all i: (i) limt→0 tQi (1/t) = 0. (ii)
ˆ ∆
|Qi (0)| < ∞. (iii) Either the function Qi = Q1 ◦ Q2 ◦ . . . ◦ Qi
ˆ
is monotonically non-decreasing and Qi+1 is convex, or Qi
is monotonically non–increasing and Qi+1 is concave (here,
the notation ◦ means function composition). Now, deﬁning
λyxx = PY |X (y|x)/PY |X (y|x ), the Gurantz’ functional is
deﬁned as
G(Y |x, x1 , . . . , xk ) =

EQ1 λY X1 X Q2 . . . Qk λY Xk Xk−1 . . .
≥ EQ1 λV U1 U Q2 . . . Qk λV Uk Uk−1 . . .

III. C HOICE OF THE C ONVEX F UNCTIONS
A convenient choice of the functions {Qi } is the following:
Q1 (t) = −ta1 , and Qi (t) = tai for i ≥ 2, where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 1,
i = 1, . . . , k. We then have so called the Hellinger transform
[8]:

dy · PY |X (y|x) · Q1 (λyx1 x ×
.

The DPI associated with the Gurantz’ functional is
the following: Let X → Y → Z be a Markov
chain and let Q1 be a convex function which, together with Q2 , . . . , Qk , complies with (i)–(iii) above.
Then, G(Y |x, x1 , . . . , xk ) ≥ G(Z|x, x1 , . . . , xk ). Let
P (x, x1 , . . . , xk ) = PX (x)P (x1 , . . . , xk |x), where PX (·)
is the actual distribution of the random variable X
and P (x1 , . . . , xk |x) is an arbitrary conditional distribution of (X1 , . . . , Xk ) given X = x. Now, for a
given {P (x1 , . . . , xk |x)}, the Gurantz’ mutual information
IG (X; Y ) can be deﬁned as

and ﬁnally, bk−1 = (1 − ak ) i=1 ai , and bk = i=1 ai .
Note that b0 , . . . , bk are all non–negative and they sum to
1. Conversely, for every {bi } with these properties, one can
ﬁnd a1 , . . . , ak , all in [0, 1], using the inverse transformation:
a1 = 1 − b0 , a2 = 1 − b1 /(1 − b0 ), etc., and ﬁnally,
k−2
ak = 1 − bk−1 /(1 − i=0 bi ). This allows us parametrize
directly in terms of {bi } without worrying about {ai }. Specializing to the case bi = 1/(k + 1) for all i = 0, 1, . . . , k,
eq. (4) extends the Bhattacharyya distance [9]. If, in addition,
k
we assign PX1 ,...,Xk |X0 (x1 , . . . , xk |x0 ) = i=1 PX (xi ), then
IG (X; Y ) = EG(Y, X, X1 , . . . , Xk ) = −e−E0 (k,PX ) , where
E0 is the Gallager function [4]

(1)

where the expectation is w.r.t. the above deﬁned joint distribution of the random variables X, X1 ,..., Xk . This GMI is now
a well–deﬁned functional of PXY = PX × PY |X . In principle,
one may apply the generalized DPI IG (X; Y ) ≥ IG (X; Z)
for any given choice of {P (x1 , . . . , xk |x)} (consider these as
parameters) and then optimize the resulting distortion bound
w.r.t. the choice of these parameters.
Our ﬁrst observation (see the full version of this paper [10]
for details) is that IG (X; Y ) is a special case of the Zakai–Ziv
GMI [15] (a.k.a. f –dissimalrity [6]), deﬁned as
IZZ (X; Y ) = EQ

Thus, IG (X; Y ) is related also the Gallager function, albeit
only at integer values of the parameter ρ. Indeed, it known
that the Gallager function (for every real ρ ≥ 0) is also a
GMI [3] and hence it satisﬁes a DPI (see also [7, Proposition
2]). The advantage of working with integer values of ρ, is that
an integral raised to an integer power (k +1) can be expressed
in terms of (k + 1)–dimensional integration over the (k + 1)
replicas, x0 ,x1 ,...,xk , that in turn can be commuted with the
integration over Y. In some situations, this is convenient.

where Q is a multivariate convex function of k variables and
µi (·, ·), i = 1, 2, . . . , k, are arbitrary measures on X × Y.
In view of this observation, one can use the Gurantz mutual information to obtain DPI’s for communication systems.

IV. A PPLICATION TO E STIMATION T HEORY
In this section, we apply the DPI associated with the
proposed information measure to obtain a Bayesian lower
bound on signal parameter estimation. In particular, our model
is the following. The source symbol U , which is uniformly
distributed in U = [−1/2, +1/2], is the parameter to be
estimated. For mathematical convenience, we deﬁne the distortion measure between a realization u of the source and an
estimate v (both in U) as d(u, v) = [(u − v) mod 1]2 . where
∆

t mod 1 = t + 2 − 1 , r being the fractional part of r, that
2
is, r = r− r . In the high–resolution limit (corresponding to
the high signal–to–noise (SNR) limit), the modulo 1 operation
has a negligible effect, and hence d(u, v) becomes essentially
equivalent to the ordinary quadratic distortion.
The channel is assumed to be an AWGN channel, namely,
the channel output is given by y(t) = x(t, u) + n(t), 0 ≤
t < T , where x(t, u) is an arbitrary waveform of unlimited
bandwidth, parametrized by u and n(t) is AWGN with two–
T
sided spectral density N0 /2. The energy E = 0 x2 (t, u)dt
is assumed to be independent of u (for reasons of simplicity).
The estimator v is a functional of the channel output waveform
{y(t), 0 ≤ t < T }.
Before deriving bounds on Ed(U, V ), we ﬁrst need to derive
the generalized rate–distortion function and the generalized
channel capacity pertaining to the generalized Bhattacharyya
distance.

The case k = 2 lacks an explicit closed–form direct relation between R and D, but it shows that
limD→∞ (log D)/ log[−R(D)] = 1, which means that the
relation between R and D is essentially linear, like in the
case k > 2, but in a slightly weaker sense.

Next, let us take the expectation w.r.t. the randomness of {Ui }.
As in [15], we resort to a lower bound (hence an upper bound
on IG (U ; Y )) based on Jensen’s inequality. Denoting x(t) =

−1/2
independent, then for all i = j:

subject to Ed(U, V ) ≤ D. This problem is solved using
calculus of variations (see [10] for details). The result of this
is as follows. Deﬁne the functions:

Accordingly, classes of signals with smaller values of
(or equivalently, higher values of the integrated variance of
x(t, U )) are expected to yield higher value of IG (U ; Y ), and
hence smaller estimation error, at least as far as our bounds
predict, and since cannot be negative, the best classes of
signals, in this sense, are those for which = 0. Note also
that for Jensen’s inequality to be reasonably tight, the random
variables {ρ(Ui , Uj )} should be all close to their expectation
with very high probability, and if this expectation vanishes,
as suggested, then {ρ(Ui , Uj )} should all be nearly zero with
very high probability. We will get back to classes of signals
with this desirable rapidly vanishing correlation property later
on.

In the limits of very low and very high distortion, one can
approximate R(D) directly as an explicit function of D. In
particular, it is shown in [10] that in the high–resolution regime
(R → 0), the behavior depends on whether k = 1, k = 2, or
k > 2. For k = 1, the distortion–rate function is approximated

{x(t, u), u ∈ U}, it does not seem to lend itself easily to
the derivation of universal lower bounds, as discussed above.
To this end, in principle, the WWB should be minimized
over all feasible correlation functions r(·), which is not a
trivial task. A reasonable compromise is to ﬁrst minimize the
WWB over r(·) for a given h, and then to maximize the
resulting expression over h (i.e., max–min instead of min–
max). Since the expression of the bound is a monotonically
increasing function of both r(h) and r(2h), and since both
r(h) and r(2h) cannot be smaller than −1, we end up
with WWB = e−E/N0 /[2(1 − e−E/N0 )] as a modulation–
independent bound. This is a faster exponential decay rate
(and hence weaker asymptotically) than that of our proposed
bound for k = 2.
It is possible, however, to obtain a universal lower bound
stronger than both bounds by a simple channel–coding argument, which is in the spirit of the Ziv–Zakai bound [16]. This
bound is given by (see [10] for the derivation):

C. Bounds for the AWGN Channel
We now equate R(D) to IG (U ; Y ) in order to obtain estimation error bounds in the high SNR regime, where the high–
resolution expressions of R(D) are relevant. As discussed
above, in this regime, we will neglect the effect of the modulo
1 operation in the deﬁnition of the distortion measure, and will
refer to it hereafter as the ordinary quadratic distortion measure. The choice k = 1 yields IG (U ; Y ) ≤ −e−(1− )E/(2N0 )
(see also [15]), and following eq. (8), this yields
E(U − V )2 ≥ D −e−(1−

)E/(2N0 )

=

e−(1− )E/N0
, (14)
16c2
1

so, the exponential decay of the lower bound is according
to e−(1− )E/N0 . For k = 2, we have log D ≈ −2(1 −
)E/(3N0 ), which means an exponential decay according to
e−2(1− )E/(3N0 ) , which is better. For k ≥ 3, we use (9) and the
resulting bound decays according to exp{−(1 − ρ)kE/[(k +
1)N0 ]}, which is better than the result of k = 1, but not
as good as the one of k = 2. Thus, the best choice of k
for the high SNR regime is k = 2, namely, a generalized
Bhattacharyya distance with k + 1 = 3 replicas, rather than
the two replicas of the ordinary Bhattacharyya distance.
Note that since ≥ 0, as mentioned earlier, then for any
family of signals, the exponential function e−2E/(3N0 ) is a universal lower bound (at high SNR) in the sense that it applies,
not only to every estimator of U , but also to every parametric
family of signals {x(t, u)}, i.e., to every modulation scheme
without being dependent on this modulation scheme (see also
[15]). This is in contrast to most of the estimation error bounds
in the literature. In other words, it sets a fundamental limit
on the entire communication system and not only on the
receiver end for a given transmitter. Indeed, for some classes of
signals, an MSE with exponential decay in E/N0 is attainable
at least in the high SNR regime, although there might be
gaps in the actual exponential rates compared to the above
mentioned bound. For example, in [11], it is discussed that
in the case of time delay estimation (x(t, u) = x0 (t − u)),
it is possible to achieve an MSE of the exponential order of
e−E/(3N0 ) by allowing the pulse s0 (t) to have bandwidth that
grows exponentially with T . Thus, by improving the lower
bound exp(−E/N0 ) (a special case of the above with k = 1)
to exp[−2E/(3N0 )], we are halving the gap between the
exponential rates of the upper bound and the lower bound,
from 2E/(3N0 ) to E/(3N0 ).
Our asymptotic lower bound should be compared to other
lower bounds available in the literature. One natural candidate
would be the Weiss–Weinstein bound (WWB) [13], [14],
which for the model under discussion at high SNR, reads [13,
p. 66]:
h2 exp{−[1 − r(h)]E/(2N0 )}

where M is a free parameter, an even integer not smaller than
4, which is subjected to optimization. Throughout the sequel,
we refer to this bound as the channel–coding bound. In the
high SNR regime, the exponential order of the channel–coding
bound (for ﬁxed M ) is exp{−EM/[2N0 (M − 2)}, which for
large enough M becomes arbitrarily close to e−E/(2N0 ) , and
hence better than the DPI bound of e−2E/(3N0 ) . In view of
this comparison, it is natural to ask then what is beneﬁt of our
DPI lower bound. The answer is in the next subsection.
D. Bounds for the AWGN Channel with Fading
It turns out that the feature that makes the DPI approach
to error lower bounds more powerful, relatively to other
approaches, is the convexity property of the GMI (in this
case, IG (U ; Y )) w.r.t. the channel PY |U . Suppose that the
channel actually depends on an additional random parameter
A (independent of U ), that is known to neither the transmitter
nor the receiver, namely,
+∞

da · PA (a)PY |U,A (y|u, a).

PY |U (y|u) =

(17)

−∞

where PA (a) is the density of A. If we think of IG (U ; Y ) as a
functional of PY |U , denoted I(PY |U (·|u)), then it is a convex
functional, namely,
+∞

I(PY |U (·|u))

= I

daPA (a)PY |U,A (·|u, a)
−∞
+∞

≤

daPA (a)I(PY |U,A (·|u, a)). (18)
−∞

This is a desirable property because the r.h.s. reﬂects a
situation where A is known to both parties, whereas the l.h.s.
pertains to the situation where A is unknown, so the lower
bound associated with the case where A is unknown is always
tighter than the expectation of the lower bound pertaining to
a known A.

where r(h) = ρ(u, u + h) = 0 x(t, u)x(t, u + h)dt/E
is assumed to depend only on h and not on u. While
this is an excellent bound for a given modulation scheme

4

Consider now the case where A is a fading parameter, drawn
only once and kept ﬁxed throughout the entire observation time
T . More precisely, our model is the same as before except that
now the signal is subjected to fading according to
y(t) = a · x(t, u) + n(t),

0 ≤ t < T,

Thus, the DPI bound is better by a factor of 22.4 (13.5dB).
Yet another comparison, perhaps more fair, can be made
with the Chazan–Zakai–Ziv bound (CZZB) [2]. According to
the CZZB, applied to our problem (see [10] for the derivation),

where a and u are realizations of the random variables A and
U , respectively. For the sake of convenience in the analysis,
we assume that A is a zero–mean Gaussian random variable
with variance σ 2 (other densities are, of course, possible too).
We next compare the three corresponding bounds in this
case. The overall channel from U to Y is

where θ = 2σ 2 /[N0 (1 + 2σ 2 E/N0 )]. On substituting this
channel into IG (U ; Y ) and assuming rapidly vanishing correlations (in view of the discussion at the end of Subsection
IV.B), we eventually obtain in the high SNR regime (see [10]
for details):

Applying the high–resolution approximation of D(R) for k ≥
1
3, we get: E(U − V )2 ≥ gk · N0 /E, where gk = 4√2 (1 −
σ
2/k)k (1 + 1/k)(k+1)/2 . A simple numerical study indicates
that {gk } is monotonically increasing and so the best bound
is obtained for k → ∞, where the constant is: limk→∞ gk =
0.03944. Thus, our asymptotic lower bound for high SNR is
lim inf

The WWB [13, p. 51], in this case, becomes
WWB =

2
f1 N0 /(σ 2 E)

2[1 − f1 /(σ

E/N0 )]

.

As can be seen, the WWB decays according to (E/N0 )−1
rather than (E/N0 )−1/2 and hence inferior to the DPI bound.
The channel–coding bound is based on a universal lower
bound on the probability of error, which holds for every signal
set. The problem is that under fading, we are not aware of such
a universal lower bound. The only remaining alternative then
is to use a lower bound corresponding to the case where A is
known to the receiver, and then to take the expectation w.r.t.
A, although one might argue that this comparison is not quite
fair. Nonetheless, the derivation of this appears in [10] and the
result is
lim inf

E/N0 →∞

(24)

which is again signiﬁcantly smaller than our bound. Thus,
we observe that while the WWB and the CZZB are excellent
bounds for ordinary channels without fading, when it comes
to channels with fading, the proposed DPI bound has an
advantage.
