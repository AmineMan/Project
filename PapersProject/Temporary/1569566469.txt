information at transmitters have been studied recently. In
[3], the interference channel model with two transmitters
sending two messages respectively to two receivers as in the
classical interference channel [4], [5] and with noncausal state
information known at transmitters was studied. In [6], a model
of the cognitive interference channel with state was studied, in
which both transmitters jointly send one message to receiver
1, and transmitter 2 sends an additional message separately
to receiver 2. Our model differs from this model in that the
message known to both transmitters needs to be decoded at
both receivers instead of at receiver 1 only as in [6]. Although
the two models appear similar to each other, their bounds on
the capacity regions have different forms as demonstrated in
our recent work [7], and the transmission schemes achieving
these regions are also different. This difference is also demonstrated by the two corresponding models without state studied
respectively in [8] and [9], and in [10].
In our recent work [7], we studied the discrete memoryless
case of the model shown in Fig. 1. In this paper, our focus is
on the Gaussian case of this model, in which the outputs at
the two receivers are corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian distributed
state sequences and Gaussian noise variables. We partition all
these Gaussian channels into two classes based on channel
parameters, and provide a comprehensive characterization of
the bounds and capacity regions for both classes. For each
class, we characterize the partial boundaries for the capacity
region. Furthermore, for some special cases, we provide full
capacity region for the channel.
We also study the cognitive interference channel with state
known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2. We establish the
capacity region for a class of channels for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases. Based on this characterization,
we show that certain Gaussian channels with state known
noncausally only at transmitter 2 achieve the capacity region or
partial boundary of the capacity region of the same model with
state known both at transmitter 2 and receiver 2. This is similar
to the result that dirty paper coding achieves the capacity of the
Gaussian channel without state [2]. Here, the channel cannot
achieve the capacity with both receivers knowing the channel
state, due to the fact that transmitter 1 does not know the
channel state.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we introduce the channel model. In Section III, we present
results on the discrete memoryless channel, which are useful
for studying Gaussian channels. In Sections IV and V, we

Abstract—A Gaussian cognitive interference channel model
with state is investigated, in which transmitters 1 and 2 communicate with receivers 1 and 2 via an interference channel.
The two transmitters jointly send one message to receivers 1 and
2, and transmitter 2 also sends a separate message to receiver
2. The channel outputs at the two receivers are corrupted by
an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian state
sequences and Gaussian noise variables. The state sequence is
noncausally known at transmitter 2 only. The Gaussian channels
are partitioned into two classes based on channel parameters. For
each class, inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are
derived, and either the partial boundary of the capacity region
or capacity region is characterized for all Gaussian channels.
The cognitive interference channel with state known at both
transmitter 2 and receiver 2 is further studied, and the capacity
region is established for a class of such channels. It is also shown
that this capacity can be achieved by certain Gaussian channels
with state noncausally known only at transmitter 2.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In this paper, we investigate a cognitive interference channel
model with state (see Fig. 1), in which two transmitters jointly
send one message to two receivers, and transmitter 2 sends an
additional message separately to receiver 2. The channel is
corrupted by an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
state sequence, which is noncausally known at transmitter 2.
This model is a generalization of the point-to-point channel
with noncausal state information known at the transmitter only,
for which Gel’fand and Pinsker established the capacity in
[1]. The capacity of the Gaussian model was established by
Costa in [2] via dirty paper coding. The model that we study
here captures more communication features of the transmitterside signal cognition and receiver-side signal interference in
addition to random state corruption of the channel. Our goal
is to study the performance (i.e., the capacity) of such a
model and correspondingly design communication schemes to
exploit the noncausal state information in the context of signal
cognition and interference.

We consider a cognitive interference channel model with
state (as shown in Fig. 1), in which transmitters 1 and 2
jointly send a message W1 to receivers 1 and 2, and transmitter
2 sends a message W2 to receiver 2. The channel is also
corrupted by an i.i.d. state sequence S n , which is noncausally
known at transmitter 2, but is not known at any other terminal.
Transmitter 1 maps a message w1 ∈ {1, . . . , 2nR1 } to an
input xn , and transmitter 2 maps a message pair (w1 , w2 )
1
with w2 ∈ {1, . . . , 2nR2 } and a state sequence sn to an
input xn . These two inputs are then sent over the memoryless
2
interference channel characterized by PY Z|X1 X2 S . Receiver 1
is required to decode W1 and receiver 2 is required to decode
W1 and W2 with the probability of error approaching zero
as the blocklength n goes to inﬁnity. The capacity region is
deﬁned to be the closure of the set of all achievable rate pairs
(R1 , R2 ).
In particular, we study the Gaussian channel with the
outputs at receivers 1 and 2 for one channel use given by

The proof is omitted due to the space limitations.
The following theorem provides a new class of channel for
which we obtain the capacity region.
Theorem 1. For the cognitive interference channel with state
noncausally known at transmitter 2, if it satisﬁes condition (5),
the capacity region consists of rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) satisfying:
R2
R1 + R2

I(X1 U ; Z) − I(U ; S|X1 )

for some distribution
PX1 SU X2 Y Z = PX1 PS PU X2 |X1 S PY Z|SX1 X2 .
Achievability of the above theorem follows from Theorem
1 in our previous work [7] by setting U = V and using (5)
to remove the redundant bounds. The converse follows from
the capacity region of the multiple access channel with state
available at one transmitter given in [11].

IV. G AUSSIAN C HANNEL : |a| ≤ 1
We partition the Gaussian cognitive interference channel
with state into two classes corresponding to |a|
1 and
|a| > 1, and study these two classes respectively in this and
next sections. In each section, we ﬁrst provide inner and outer
bounds for these channels, and then characterize either partial
boundaries or the capacity region of the capacity region for
all channels.

where the noise variables N1 , N2 ∼ N (0, 1), and S ∼
N (0, Q). Both the noise variables and the state variable are
i.i.d. over channel uses. The channel inputs are subject to
average power constraints P1 and P2 .
In the following, we deﬁne a number of channel conditions
for classifying the channels.

A. Inner and Outer Bounds
If |a| 1, the Gaussian channel satisﬁes the condition (2).
We ﬁrst provide an inner bound for this class of Gaussian
cognitive channels with state.

for all PU X1 X2 S s.t. U → X1 X2 S → Y Z

Intuitively, if a channel satisﬁes (2), receiver 2 is stronger
in decoding X2 , and if a channel satisﬁes (3), receiver 1 is
stronger in decoding X2 . If a channel satisﬁes (4), receiver
2 is stronger in decoding W1 , and if a channel satisﬁes (5),
receiver 1 is stronger in decoding W1 .

the rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) are on the boundary of the capacity

boundary of the capacity region with the state known at both
transmitter 2 and receiver2.
Then consider the inner bound 2 given in Proposition 2. Let

R1 + R2 . Then the rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) are on the boundary of
the capacity region if r12 (∆∗ ) − R2 r1 (∆∗ ), where ∆∗ =

The rate pairs given in the theorem is clearly achievable.
They can also be shown to be on the boundary of either the
outer bound 1 given in Corollary 1 or the outer bound 2 given
in Proposition 3, thus the rate pairs are on the boundary of
the capacity bound.
In Fig. 2, we demonstrate partial boundaries of the capacity
region characterized in Theorem 3. We consider the channel
deﬁned by the parameters P1 = P2 = Q = 1, b = 0.85,
c = 0.9 and a = 0.8. We plot the boundaries of the two
inner bounds given in Proposition 1 and Proposition 2, and
the boundaries of the two outer bounds given in Corollary 1
and Proposition 3, respectively. Under this coefﬁcients set, the
two inner bounds match with the corresponding outer bounds.
It is clear that the boundary of the inner bound 1 matches the
boundary of outer bound 1 when R1 is bigger than a certain
value, and this part is thus part of the boundary of the capacity
region. We note that this part of the boundary also achieves
the capacity region of the same channel with state also known
at receiver 2. It can further be seen that the boundary of the
inner bound 2 matches the boundary of outer bound 2 when
R2 is above a certain threshold, and this part is also part of
the boundary of the capacity region.

The above theorem is based on Lemma 1 by employing

We provide two outer bounds for this Gaussian class, both
of which are useful for characterizing capacity results in the

Theorem 4. (Capacity) For the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if

Proof: (Outline) By setting U = V in the inner bound for
the general discrete memoryless channel given in Theorem 1
in [7], and applying condition (3), we obtain an inner bound.
Based on this inner bound, by choosing the joint Gaussian
input distribution and employing dirty paper coding for U to
deal with the state in Z, we obtain the desired inner bound.

We note that the above region matches the capacity in [6]
of another cognitive interference model with state, in which
W1 is decoded only at receiver 1. This is reasonable because
under the condition (4), receiver 1 is weaker in decoding W1
than receiver 2, and hence, receiver 2 already decodes W1 ,
which satisﬁes the additional requirement in the model of this
paper.

Remark 1. The above theorem implies that the Gaussian
cognitive interference channel with state known only to transmitter 2 achieve the capacity of the same channel with state
also known to receiver 2 if the channel satisﬁes |a| ≤ 1 and
condition (4). This is similar to the result that dirty paper
coding achieves the capacity of the Gaussian channel without
state [2]. Here, the channel cannot achieve the capacity with
both receivers knowing the channel state due to the fact that
transmitter 1 does not know the channel state.

For those Gaussian channels with |a| > 1, we characterize
partial boundaries of the capacity region in the following
theorem.

Theorem 5. (Partial Boundary of Capacity Region) For
the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state noncausally known at transmitter 2, if |a| > 1, consider the inner
′
bound given in Proposition 4. We let ∆ = (ρ21 , ρ2s , P2 ),
and use r2 (∆), r12 (∆), r12 (∆) to denote the bound on R2
˜
and two bounds on R1 + R2 , respectively. Then the rate
pairs (R1 , R2 ) are on the boundary of the capacity region
if r12 (∆∗ ) r12 (∆∗ ), where ∆∗ = argmax r12 (∆), or if
˜

The proof for the above theorem is omitted due to the space
limitations. It can be shown that the above capacity region is
equivalent to the capacity region of the multiple access channel
with state given in [11]. This is reasonable because under the
condition (5), receiver 2 is weaker than receiver 1 in decoding
W1 , and hence dominates the rate region.

log(1 + P2 ).

Similarly as the proof for Theorem 3, achievable points are
on the boundary of the outer bound.
In Fig. 3, we demonstrate the partial boundary of the
capacity region characterized in Theorem 5. We consider the
channel deﬁned by the parameters P1 = P2 = Q = 1, a = 1.5,

If |a| > 1, the Gaussian channel satisﬁes condition (3). We
ﬁrst provide an inner bound for this class of channels.

b = 1.6 and c = 0.9. We plot the boundaries of the inner
bound given in Proposition 4 and the outer bound given in
Proposition 5, respectively. It is clear that the two boundaries
match when R2 is above a certain threshold, and this part is
thus part of the boundary of the capacity region.

Theorem 8. (Capacity) For the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state known at transmitter 2 and receiver
2, if it satisﬁes the condition (2), the capacity region consists
of rate pairs (R1 , R2 ) satisfying:

Also, under certain condition, we can characterize the full

Proof: (Outline) The achievability follows from Proposition 4 by applying the condition (5). Such an achievable region
matches the capacity region of the multiple access channel
with state studied in [11], which is an outer bound. Therefore,
the proof is concluded.
VI. S TATE KNOWN AT BOTH TRANSMITTER 2 AND
RECEIVER 2
In this section, we provide the capacity region for a class
of cognitive interference channels with state known at both
transmitter 2 and receiver 2. This result has its own interest
and is also useful for providing the tight converse for studying
Gaussian channels with state known only at transmitter 2 as
shown in Theorems 3 and 2.

Theorem 7. (Capacity) For the cognitive interference channel
with state known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2, if it
satisﬁes condition (2), the capacity region consists of rate pairs
(R1 , R2 ) satisfying:

The proof is omitted due to the space limitations.
We note that we have further shown the capacity region for
both DMC and Gaussian channels without condition (2). These
more general results will be included in a journal version of
this work which is currently under preparation.
VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the Gaussian cognitive interference channel with state noncausally known at one transmitter. We partitioned Gaussian channels into two classes.
For each class, we derived inner and outer bounds on the
capacity region, and characterized either partial boundary
of the capacity region or full capacity region. Furthermore,
we established the capacity region for a class of cognitive
interference channels with state known at transmitter and
receiver 2 for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian cases.
In particular, this capacity region was shown to be tight for
certain Gaussian channels without state known at receiver 2.

The achievability follows from Theorem 1 in our work [7]
