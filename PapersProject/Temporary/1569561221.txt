Abstract—In energy harvesting communication systems, the
energy required for message transmission is maintained by an
exogenous energy arrival process independent of the message.
This links the problem of communication with an energy harvesting transmitter to the problem of communication over statedependent channels. In particular, if the transmitter has no
battery, the available energy can be viewed as a state and
the resulting channel is a state-dependent channel with causal
state information at the transmitter only. In general, information
transmission blurs the state information that the receiver can get
from the received signal. In this paper, we explore the trade-off
between the information rate R and the entropy reduction of
the energy arrival process ∆ at the receiver side over an AWGN
channel with an energy harvesting transmitter. If the transmitter
has no battery, the trade-off points are achieved by Shannon
strategies and we show that the optimal input distributions are
discrete. Next, we consider the state ampliﬁcation problem for
an energy harvesting transmitter with an unlimited battery. We
show that the optimal trade-off region in this extreme case is
expressed explicitly in a simple form and its boundary is achieved
by a combination of best-effort-transmit and random binning
schemes with an i.i.d. Gaussian codebook of average power equal
to the average recharge rate. Finally, we propose an uncoded
state ampliﬁcation scheme that splits the energy between message
transmission and entropy reduction and study its performance
in a numerical example.

where Xi is the channel input, Yi is the channel output, and
Ni is the i.i.d. zero-mean unit-variance Gaussian noise, in
the ith channel use. E1 , . . . , En is the i.i.d. energy arrival
sequence which is independent of the message. The code
symbol energy at the ith channel use is constrained according
to the exogenous energy arrival and the availability of a
battery (energy buffer) at the transmitter. In particular, if there
is no battery at the transmitter, the transmitter observes Ei

and generates a channel input Xi that satisﬁes Xi ≤ Ei ,
i.e., the code symbol is amplitude constrained to (the square
root of) the observed energy. In [1], [2], we addressed this
system and found the capacity achieving scheme by solving
for the maximum mutual information between the input and
the output of an extended input channel. More speciﬁcally,
we proved in [1], [2] that the code symbols need to be chosen
from a ﬁnite set in the capacity achieving scheme analogous
to [3]. In the other extreme, if the transmitter has an unlimited
battery, some portion of the arriving energy can be stored in
the battery and the code symbol energy at the ith channel use
is constrained to the energy in the battery at the beginning of
the ith channel use. We studied this problem in [4], [5] and
found that the capacity of this system is equal to the capacity

I. I NTRODUCTION
Energy harvesting is a promising technology for many
wireless networking applications as it brings self-sustainability
and practically unlimited lifetime. In applications where transmitter has an energy harvesting capability, energy needed to
send messages is replenished stochastically throughout the
communication session. From an information-theoretic point
of view, the stochasticity of the energy at the transmitter
side connects this setting to state-dependent channels [1], [2]:
energy can be viewed as a state of the channel that is perfectly
known to the transmitter but unknown to the receiver. In many
applications, e.g., energy harvesting sensors, the receiver may
aim at extracting energy state information from the received
signal as well as decoding the message. In this paper, we
explore the interaction of these two objectives.
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider an energy harvesting
transmitter with an unlimited battery or no battery sending
messages over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel. An exogenous energy source supplies Ei amount

since only causal information of energy arrivals is available.
√
In particular, |Xi (w, Ei )| ≤ Ei for all w ∈ W and Ei ∈ E.
The receiver performs two decoding operations after receiving
the sequence Y n : decoding the message w ∈ W and list
decoding the energy arrival sequence {Ei }n . A rate-entropy
i=1
reduction pair (R, ∆) is achievable if there exists a sequence
of (2nR , 2n∆ , n) codes with probabilities of message and list
decoding errors converging to zero as the block length is
increased. The optimal trade-off region R is the closure of
all achievable (R, ∆) pairs.
We ﬁrst note that R is a convex region [7]. In view of
[7, Theorem 2] and replacing the auxiliary variable U with
Shannon strategy (T1 , T2 ) [11] where Ti is the channel input
when energy Ei is observed, the region R is characterized as

with average power constrained to the average recharge rate
and it is achieved by save-and-transmit or best-effort-transmit
schemes using a Gaussian codebook.
In [1], [2], [4], [5], the sole purpose of the transmitter is
to convey the message which is independent of the energy
arrival process. However, the transmitter may help the receiver
get some information about the energy arrival process at the
transmitter. In this paper, we analyze the interaction between
the message transmission rate and the receiver’s information
about the energy arrival process at the transmitter. In particular,
there is a trade-off between these two objectives in view of
the connection of this setting with state-dependent channels
with causal state information at the transmitter. This tradeoff has been well studied for state-dependent channels with
causal or noncausal state information at the transmitter [6]–
[10] where the information the receiver can learn about the
state is measured by different metrics.
In this paper, we use entropy reduction metric used in [7]
and characterize the fundamental trade-off between the entropy
reduction ∆ of transmitter’s energy arrivals at the receiver
and the message transmission rate R in an energy harvesting
communication system with causal energy state information
at the transmitter only. When the transmitter has no battery,
we ﬁnd the optimal (R, ∆) trade-off points using Shannon
strategies and prove that the optimal input distributions are
discrete. When the transmitter has an unlimited battery, we
show that the optimal trade-off region has a simple form.
Speciﬁcally, no information about the energy arrival process at
the transmitter can be obtained at the receiver when the system
is operated at the highest message rate. Finally, we propose
an uncoded state ampliﬁcation scheme that splits the energy
between message transmission and entropy reduction.

If the goal of the encoder is only to transmit messages and not

In this section, we consider a batteryless energy harvesting
transmitter as shown in the bottom ﬁgure of Fig. 1. For brevity,
we consider a binary energy arrival process with alphabet E =
{e1 , e2 } and probabilities P (Ei = e1 ) = pe1 and P (Ei =
e2 ) = pe2 for all i.
As the energy at each channel use varies as an i.i.d. process
and is independent of the message w ∈ W, the resulting
channel is a state-dependent channel with causal state information at the transmitter [1], [2], [11]. The transmitter helps the
receiver estimate the energy arrived at the transmitter’s side
while sending a message w ∈ W at the same time where
|W| = 2nR . The receiver forms a list Ln (Y n ) ⊂ E n of
possible energy arrival sequences upon receiving the sequence
Y n . Before receiving Y n , the size of the list is 2nH(E) , the size
of the typical set of energy arrival sequences. Upon receiving
Y n , the list size is dropped to |Ln (Y n )|. Hence, the energy
arrival sequence uncertainty reduction rate is

As R is a convex region and due to its characterization
in (3)-(5), one can show after algebraic rearrangements that
the boundary of R is obtained by solving the following
optimization problems for all µ ≥ 0:
max µI(T1 , T2 ; Y ) + h(Y )

A main conclusion we draw in this paper is that the optimal
input distributions for all µ ≥ 0 are discrete:

A (2nR , 2n∆ , n) code is composed of an encoder map X n :

The proof of Theorem 1 follows from steps that have been
followed in [3], [12], [13] and the ﬁniteness claim is proved
using a contradiction argument. The problem in (10) is a
functional convex optimization problem. As a ﬁrst step, we
show that the space of feasible distributions Ω is a convex and
compact set and the objective function in (10) is concave in
the input distribution in the weak topology. Next, we obtain
an optimality condition in terms of the mutual information
density, the entropy density and the support set of the optimal
input distribution. Then, we prove that the mutual information
density and the entropy density have analytic extensions over
C2 . Finally, by invoking the identity theorem for analytic
functions, we show that the optimality condition causes a
contradiction when the support set is assumed inﬁnite. In
particular, the mutual information density and entropy density
are given, respectively, as

In this section, we consider the state ampliﬁcation problem
with an energy harvesting transmitter that has an unlimited
battery [4], [5] as shown in the top ﬁgure of Fig. 1. At each
channel use, the energy arrival replenishes, while the code
symbol energy reduces, the battery energy. Hence, the code
symbol at the beginning of a channel use is constrained by
the current energy level in the battery:

where (19) is due to the independence of the message W

Xi is a function of W and E1 , . . . , Ei , and (22) is due to
the memoryless property of the AWGN channel. We note that

I(Xi , Ei ; Yi ) = h(Yi ) − 2 log2 (2πe). Hence, we get:

The proof of the ﬁniteness of SF ∗ is by the following contradiction argument. Assume that SF ∗ is inﬁnite. By compactness

In addition, the entropy reduction is bounded by the entropy
of the energy arrival process as ∆ ≤ H(E). It remains to
determine the bound on R + ∆. We can bound R + ∆ as

We assume that the transmitter has only causal information;
however, it will be clear that the trade-off region is invariant
under causal or noncausal information. At the ith channel use,
the transmitter has the observations E1 , . . . , Ei and determines
the code symbol accordingly. The state ampliﬁcation problem
in this setting is to characterize the achievable information rate
R and entropy reduction ∆ of the energy arrival sequence at
the receiver side under the code symbol constraints in (16).
We found in [4], [5] that the maximum rate of information
achievable under the input constraints in (16) and causal or
noncausal information of the energy arrival information is

where i(t1 , t2 ; F ) and h(t1 , t2 ; F ) are continuous functions in
R2 and they both have analytic extensions over C2 . Moreover,
Ω is convex and compact; I(T1 , T2 ; Y ) and h(Y ) are both
concave and weakly differentiable functionals of F . Therefore,
we have the following theorem:

For all µ ≥ 0, the right hand side of (15) is a constant and
in view of [13, Corollary 9], log2 (p(y; F )) is constant for all
y ∈ R, which is impossible as p(y; F ) is a probability density
function, yielding a contradiction, and consequently, proving
the ﬁniteness claim in Theorem 1.

On the other hand, the bound in (25) is achievable by a
combination1 of the best-effort-transmit scheme in [4], [5] with
the random binning in [7]. In particular, we consider a blockby-block encoding scheme of B blocks; each block is of n
channel uses. We consider a single i.i.d. Gaussian codebook
1
with average power E[Ei ]− ǫ composed of 2n 2 log2 (1+E[Ei ]−ǫ)
codewords with block length n. In each block, we allocate
1
0 ≤ R ≤ 2 log2 (1 + E[Ei ] − ǫ) bits for the message transmission and remaining Γ = 1 log2 (1 + E[Ei ] − ǫ)−R bits for
2
state ampliﬁcation. Hence, we have 2nR bins each composed
of 2nΓ sequences, i.e., we divide the index interval [1 :
1
2n 2 log2 (1+E[Ei ]−ǫ) ] into 2nR intervals [w2nΓ : (w + 1)2nΓ ],
w = 1, . . . , 2nR − 1 where w is a message index. In the
ﬁrst block, an arbitrary codeword independent of the energy
arrival sequence is sent. The transmitter observes the energy
arrival sequence E1 , . . . , En , maps it to one of 2nΓ indices
independent of the message w. Then, according to the chosen
message index w, the codeword to be sent is determined. The
transmitter uses the best-effort-transmit scheme: if the energy
of the code symbol Xi in the ith channel use is higher than
2
the energy in the battery Ebi (i.e., Xi > Ebi ), then a zero
symbol is put; otherwise, the code symbol Xi is sent as it
is. The codeword X1 , . . . , Xn is sent with only ﬁnitely many
2
mismatches as Xi > Ebi occurs only in ﬁnitely many channel
uses and this causes no error in the decoding of the sent
codeword [4], [5]. As X1 , . . . , Xn is decoded at the receiver
side with vanishing probability of error, the receiver recovers
the message index w and the bin index for the observed energy
arrival sequence as the block length n gets larger. If we allow
B increase and ǫ → 0, we have R + ∆ ≤ 1 log2 (1 + E[Ei ]).
2

In this section, we propose a suboptimal uncoded state
ampliﬁcation scheme based on the power splitting scheme in
[6]. Pure state ampliﬁcation in the energy harvesting communication context is just putting a code symbol of energy equal to
the observed energy. The transmitter puts the channel symbol
√
√
e1 when e1 is observed and − e2 when e2 is observed. This
scheme corresponds to the deterministic auxiliary selection at
√
√
(T1 , T2 ) = ( e1 , − e2 ). We denote the entropy reduction in
the uncoded transmission as ∆uc .
1
(29)
∆uc = h(Y ) − log2 (2πe)
2
√
√
where p(y) = pe1 φ(y − e1 ) + pe2 φ(y + e2 ). Note that the
message transmission rate in this uncoded state ampliﬁcation
scheme is zero. In addition, all energy is utilized immediately
after it is observed and hence the existence of a battery does
not affect the performance.
Next, we propose an energy splitting scheme for simultaneous information transmission and entropy reduction. Upon
observing energy ei , αei is allocated for state ampliﬁcation
and (1 − α)ei is allocated for message transmission where
0 ≤ α ≤ 1. The transmitter puts αe1 when e1 is observed and
−αe2 when e2 is observed with the goal of entropy reduction.
The remaining energy is allocated for message transmission.
When the transmitter has no battery, the channel is
Yi = Xi + αEi + Ni

(1 − α)e1 if e1 is observed and |Xi | ≤
where |Xi | ≤
(1 − α)e2 if e2 is observed. Hence, we ﬁnd the optimal
input distribution of the following extended input channel:

p(y|t1 , t2 ) = pe1 φ(y − t1 − αe1 ) + pe2 φ(y − t2 + αe2 )

∆ ≤ H(E)
(26)
1
(27)
R + ∆ ≤ log2 (1 + E[E])
2
We observe from Theorem 3 that the optimal trade-off
region in the unlimited battery case is expressed explicitly in
a simple form and the maximum entropy reduction ∆∗ is
∆∗ = min H(E),

log2 (1 + E[E])
2

(30)

¯
where |ti | ≤ (1 − α)ei . We note that the capacity achieving scheme for this extended input alphabet channel is also
discrete which can be proved using similar steps and the
contradiction argument. For given α, the message transmission rate R is the capacity of the channel in (31) and the
resulting ∆ is the maximum entropy reduction subject to
the message transmission rate R. These values are found by
evaluating the region for the original channel in (3)-(5) at

When the transmitter has unlimited battery, the energy that
is allocated for message transmission can be saved in the
battery and using the best-effort-transmit scheme in [4], [5],
the following maximum rate is achievable:

(28)

We also observe that in the unlimited battery case the entropy
reduction is zero when the transmitter operates at the infor1
mation transmission capacity 2 log2 (1 + E[E]). In this case,
the received sequence Y n is almost independent of the energy
arrival proﬁle E n even though the message transmission is
enabled by the energy E n . Therefore, the unlimited sized
energy queue acts as an information hider [14] and the receiver
can get no information about the energy arrival sequence if the
message transmission is performed at the capacity. Finally,
the (R, ∆) region in Theorem 3 remains unchanged if the
transmitter had noncausal information of the energy arrivals.

VI. A N UMERICAL E XAMPLE
In this section, we provide a numerical example of the
optimal trade-off region R as well as the proposed suboptimal
uncoded state ampliﬁcation scheme under a binary energy
arrival process with no battery and unlimited battery. In
particular, e1 = 1, e2 = 2.25 with pe1 = 0.8, so that the energy
arrival has entropy H(E) = 0.7219 bits. The channel capacity
with no battery and with unlimited battery are calculated as
C0 = 0.5369 bits and C∞ = 1 log2 (1 + E[E]) = 0.5850 bits,
2
respectively. We observe that in the no battery case, the√
sym√
metric binary distribution of (T1 , T2 ) located at ( E1 , E2 )
√
√
and (− E1 , − E2 ) maximizes I(T1 , T2 ; Y ) and h(Y ) simultaneously. Therefore, the trade-off region generated by this
symmetric binary distribution is the optimal trade-off region.
We calculate the maximum entropy reduction in this case as
∆∗ = 0.5652 bits. In the unlimited battery case, the boundary
of the optimal (R, ∆) region is the line R + ∆ = 0.5850
and in particular, ∆∗ = 0.5850 bits as H(E) > 0.5850. Note
that ∆∗ is higher in the unlimited battery case though battery
blurs the energy arrival information. This is due to the fact
that higher rates can be achieved with an unlimited battery.
Moreover, note that lossless recovery of the state sequence at
the receiver is not possible for no battery and unlimited battery
cases since ∆∗ is less than H(E) in both cases. We plot the
resulting trade-off regions and the points achievable by the
proposed uncoded state ampliﬁcation scheme in Fig. 2. Note
that in the case of no battery if I(T1 , T2 ; Y ) and h(Y ) are
maximized at different discrete distributions of (T1 , T2 ), then
the optimal (R, ∆) region is a union of many regions.
We calculate the entropy reduction in the uncoded transmission case as ∆uc = 0.4466 bits. As the energy splitting
variable α is varied, we observe that the achieved (R, ∆)
points travel from one edge to the other strictly interior to
the optimal regions under no battery and unlimited battery
cases. Therefore, in this case, digitizing the state sequence
by means of channel codewords is optimal and analog state
ampliﬁcation performs suboptimally. Moreover, we observe
that when there is no battery at the transmitter, even if the
message transmission is performed at the capacity, there is a
non-zero energy arrival information leakage to the receiver. In
contrast, the receiver gets no information about the energy
arrival process if transmitter has an unlimited battery and
message transmission is performed at the capacity.

case and we proved that the optimal input distributions are
discrete. In the unlimited battery case, we showed that the
optimal trade-off region can be expressed explicitly in a simple
form and its boundary is achieved by a combination of besteffort-transmit and random binning schemes. We proposed
an uncoded state ampliﬁcation scheme and showed via a
numerical example that digitizing the energy state performs
signiﬁcantly better than the uncoded scheme.

VII. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we characterized the trade-off region between
entropy reduction ∆ of the energy arrivals and the message
transmission rate R in a communication system with an energy
harvesting transmitter with no or unlimited battery. Shannon
strategies achieve the boundary of the region in the no battery
