introduced by Wolfowitz [5] is one of the most important
models that deals with channel uncertainty, and continues to
attract much attention from researchers (see [6] and references
therein). Composite models are more appropriate to deal with
wireless scenarios since unlike compound models they deal
with channel uncertainty by introducing a PD Pθ on the
channel selection. These models consist of a set of conditional
PDs from which the current channel index θ, which can be a
vector of parameters, is drawn according to Pθ and remains
ﬁxed during the communication. An example of this model can
be slowly fading channels. Capacity for this class of channels
has been widely studied beforehand (see [7] and references
therein), for wireless scenarios via the well-known notion of
outage capacity (see [8] and references therein) and oblivious
cooperation over fading Gaussian channels in [9]–[11].
In this paper, we study the composite multiple relay network
where the channel index θ ∈ Θ is randomly drawn according
to Pθ . The index θ = (θr , θd ) remains ﬁxed during the
communication but is unknown at the source, fully known at
the destination and partly known θr at the relays end. Although
a compound approach can guarantee asymptotically zero-error
probability regardless of θ, it would be not an adequate choice
for most of wireless models. As a different approach, the
coding rate r is selected regardless of the current index.
Hence the encoder cannot necessarily guarantee arbitrary small
error probability. In this case the asymptotic error probability
becomes the measure of interest, characterizing the reliability
function. Moreover, it turns out that depending on the channel
draw, there may not be a unique set of relay functions that
minimizes the error probability. In other words, the relay
function should be chosen based on the channel parameters.
However, since full CSI is not available to all nodes, the
relay functions are usually chosen regardless of their channel
measurements which becomes the bottleneck of the coding.
We present a novel coding strategy from which the relays
can select, based on their measurements, an adequate coding
strategy. To this purpose an achievable region that generalizes
NNC to the case of mixed coding strategy, where DF relays
exploit the help of CF relays, is derived.
Section II presents deﬁnitions and Section III introduces
main results, and the sketch of proofs is relegated to Section
IV. Finally, numerical evaluation over the slow-fading Gaussian two relay channel is presented in Section V.

Abstract—Consider a composite unicast relay network where
the channel statistic is randomly drawn from a set of conditional
distributions indexed by θ ∈ Θ, which is assumed to be unknown
at the source, fully known at the destination and only partly
known at the relays. Commonly, the coding strategy at each
relay is ﬁxed regardless of its channel measurement. A novel
coding for unicast composite networks with multiple relays is
introduced. This enables the relays to select dynamically –based
on its channel measurement– the best coding scheme between
compress-and-forward (CF) and decode-and-forward (DF). As a
part of the main result, a generalization of Noisy Network Coding
is shown for the case of unicast general networks where the relays
are divided between those using DF and CF coding. Furthermore,
the relays using DF scheme can exploit the help of those based on
CF scheme via offset coding. It is demonstrated via numerical
results that this novel coding, referred to as Selective Coding
Strategy (SCS), outperforms conventional coding schemes.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Multiterminal networks are the essential part of modern
telecommunication systems. Recently, these were studied from
various aspects. The cutset bound for the general multicast
network was established in [1]. Network coding theorem for
the graphical multicast network was investigated in [2] where
the max-ﬂow min-cut theorem for network information ﬂow
was presented for the point-to-point communication network.
Whereas Lim et al. proposed the Noisy Network Coding
(NNC) scheme for the general multicast network, which includes most of the existing bounds on multiterminal networks
[3]. Kramer et al. developed an inner bound for a point-topoint general network using decode-and-forward (DF) which
achieves the capacity of the degraded multicast network [4].
For the above mentioned scenarios, the probability distribution (PD) of the network is supposed to be ﬁxed during the
communication and hence available to all nodes beforehand.
However, wireless channels are essentially time-varying due
to fading and user mobility, and hence the terminals do not
have full knowledge of all channel parameters involved in
the communication. In particular, without feedback channel
state information (CSI) cannot be available to the encoders
end. During years, an ensemble of research activities has
been dedicated to both theoretical and practical aspects of
communication in presence of channel uncertainty. From an
information-theoretic viewpoint, the compound channel, ﬁrst

We emphasize that for channels satisfying the strong converse
property and with unique best code word, e.g., Gaussian slowfading single user channel, (3) coincides with the deﬁnition of
the outage probability for the unique best codeword.
In the present setting, we assume that the source is not aware
of the speciﬁc draw θ ∼ Pθ and hence, the coding rate r
and the coding strategy –DF or CF scheme– must be chosen
independent of the channel draw. Furthermore, both remain
ﬁxed during the communication regardless of the channel
measurement at the relays end. We aim to characterize the
smallest possible average error probability as deﬁned by (2),
as a function of the coding rate r.
It can be shown that ¯(r) can be bounded as follows

where Rθ is any achievable rate for the unicast network with
a given θ, and Sθ is the inﬁmum of all rates such that every
code with such rate yields error probability tending to one,
and C as all codes. It can be shown that Sθ can be replaced
with max-ﬂow min-cut bound. A special case of this result
has been proved in recent work [11] for the relay channel.

Consider the composite unicast network with multiple relays
and parameters θ. The rate is ﬁxed to r and so is the source
code. The goal is to minimize the expected error probability.
The common option is that each relay ﬁxes its coding strategy,
namely DF or Compress-and-Forward (CF), regardless of θ.
In other words, the relays with index in V ⊆ N will use CF
scheme. For instance, to evaluate the expected error probability
we ﬁrst present an achievable rate for the multiple relay
network where NNC is generalized to networks with mixed
cooperative strategy. Part of relays are using DF coding while
the reminding relays use CF scheme. Moreover, DF relays
exploit the help of CF relays to decode the source message.
Using this theorem, an achievable rate can be obtained for
every set V of relay nodes.
Theorem 1 (Cooperative Mixed NNC): For the multiple relay channel, the following rate is achievable

where X denotes the channel input, Xkθr and Zkθr the relay
inputs and outputs and Y1θ the channel output. We assume a
memoryless multiple relay channel with N relays but single
source and destination. The channels are indexed by vector
of parameters θ = (θd , θr ) with θd ∈ Θd , θr ∈ Θr , where
θr denotes all parameters affecting the relays’ output and θd
are the remaining parameters involved in the communication.
Let Pθ be a joint probability measure on Θ. The channel
parameters affecting relay and destination outputs θ = (θr , θd )
are drawn according to the joint PD Pθ and remain ﬁxed
during the communication. However, the speciﬁc draw of θ
is assumed to be unknown at the source, fully known at the
destination and partly known θr at the relays end. Assume that
N = {1, . . . , N } and for any S ⊆ N , XS = {Xi : i ∈ S}.

Deﬁnition 1 (code and achievability): A code-C(n, Mn , r)

In the preceding scheme all relays ﬁx coding regardless of the
available CSI. However, it is possible that the relays select
and change their coding based on its CSI. To this purpose
each relay generates many codebooks and sends one of them
which ﬁts the best to the channel with the parameter θr . More
(k)
precisely, each relay k has a decision region DDF such that
(k)
for all θr ∈ DDF , the relay k uses DF scheme and otherwise
it uses CF scheme. For each V ⊆ N , deﬁne DV as follows:

j∈V

Notice that RT (S) (condition of correct decoding at the
(k)
destination) is in general better than RTk (S) (condition of
correct decoding at the relay k). This is because the destination
uses backward decoding. Moreover using the same technique
as [12], it can be shown that the optimization in (5) can be
done over T ⊆ V instead of T ∈ Υ (V). In other words the
relays in T ⊆ V c can increase the rate only if they satisfy (7).
It can be seen that for each T , if there is A ⊆ T such that
QT (A) < 0, then we can remove the relays in A from T and
the rate is improved by not using their compression, which
is easier to manipulate in composite setting. By choosing
V = N , the region of Theorem 1 is reduced to the same region,
as in [12], [13], which is equivalent to NNC region [3]. So
Theorem 1 generalizes and includes the previous NNC scheme
and it provides a potentially larger region. Indeed, for the
degraded single relay channel, it is capacity achieving while
NNC is strictly suboptimal. In fact, relay nodes are divided
into two groups. The ﬁrst group is V c which are using DF
coding and the second group V which are using CF scheme.
Now consider the composite setting again. Before starting
the communication, the source knows that the relays with
index in V use CF while the others use DF scheme. For each
θ and V, the rate r is achievable if it belongs to the region in
the previous theorem and otherwise an error is declared. All
that CF relays can do in this case is to choose their distribution
based on θr such that it minimizes the error probability. Thus
the expected error probability for the composite multiple relay
channel with partial CSI θr at the relays is bounded by

then this will become DF relaying. The source, oblivious to the
relays decision, generates its own code by using superposition

coding and X is superimposed over XN , i.e., all possible DF
relay inputs. This does not affect RT (S, θ) by applying the

proper Markov chain, but changes RTk (S, θ), as we will see.

On the other hand, if θr ∈ DDF then CF scheme is used.

Note that unlike DF, the code which is used for CF X(k) , is
independent of the source code and so its PD can be chosen
adaptively based on θr . The optimum choice for DV will
potentially give a better outage probability than the case that
each relay is using a ﬁxed coding for all θr . This provides a
non-formal proof of the next theorem.

of relays will thus provide the regions DV which are mutually
disjoint and all together form a partitioning over the set Θr .
Now if θr ∈ DV , we have a multiple relay network where the
relays in V are using CF. The achievable rate corresponding
to this case is known from Theorem 1.

IV. S KETCH OF THE P ROOF OF T HEOREM 1
Consider ﬁrst the two relay network. Relay 1 uses DF
scheme to help the source so it has to decode the source
messages successively and not backwardly, and Relay 2 uses
CF scheme. However, relay 1 wants to exploit the help of
relay 2 to decode the source message. So it does not start
decoding until it retrieves the compression index. To this end,
relay 1 uses offset decoding which means that it waits two
blocks instead of one to decode the source message and the
compression index. In block b = 2, the relay 1 decodes the
compression index l1 and the message w1 . Equally, the source
code at block b + 2 is correlated with relay 1 code from the
block b and not block b + 1. This comes at the expense of one
block of delay. The source has to wait until b = B + L to start
backward-decoding. The compression index lB+2 is repeated
until the block B + L. Fix P , V, T and Tk ’s such that they
maximize the right hand side of (5). Assume a set Mn of
size 2nR of message indices W to be transmitted, again in
B + L blocks, each of them of length n. At the last L − 2
blocks, the last compression index is ﬁrst decoded and then
all compression indices and transmitted messages are jointly
decoded. Relays in V c start to decode after block 2.

(i) After the transmission of the block i = [1 : B + 1] and
for each k ∈ V c , with the assumption that all messages
and compression indices up to block i − 1 have been

index (wb , ˆTk b ) by looking at two consecutive blocks b
ˆ l
and b + 1 such that:

source and relay powers are respectively 1 and 10. It can be
seen that none of the non-selective strategies like full DF, full
CF and Mixed Coding is not in general the best regardless of
fading coefﬁcients. However, if one lets the relay select their
strategy given its channel measurement, this SCS will lead to
signiﬁcant improvement compared to the other strategies and
becomes close to the cutset bound.

Using the previous inequalities, and by choosing ﬁnite L
but large enough, by letting (B, n) → ∞ and adding the
time-sharing random variable Q the proof is ﬁnished.

Deﬁne Ni ’s to be additive noises, i.i.d. circularly symmetric
complex Gaussian RVs with zero-mean; let hij ’s be independent zero-mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian RVs.
d is the random path-loss. The average power of the source and

noises Z1 = Z1 + N1 , Z2 = Z2 + N2 . It is assumed that
the source is not aware of the fading coefﬁcients, the relays
know all fading coefﬁcients except hi3 ’s and the destination
is fully aware of everything. The possibilities to choose the
proper cooperative strategy are as follows: (i) both relays use
DF scheme to transmit the information (full DF case), (ii)
both relays use CF scheme to transmit the information (full
CF case), where the destination can consider one or both
relays as noise to prevent the performance degradation, and
(iii) one relay uses DF scheme and the other uses CF scheme
(Mixed Coding case). Finally, the relays can select their coding
strategy based on the channel parameters (SCS case).
Fig. 3 presents numerical analysis of these strategies. We
assume all fading coefﬁcients are of unit variance and so are
the noises. d is chosen with uniform distribution between 0 and
0.1, which means the ﬁrst relay is always around the source.
Given this assumption, we suppose that the ﬁrst relay uses DF
in case of mixed coding while the other uses CF scheme. The
