Abstract—The multi-way relay channel (MWRC) models cooperative communication networks in which many users exchange
messages via a relay. In this paper, we consider the ﬁnite ﬁeld
MWRC with correlated messages. The problem is to ﬁnd all
achievable rates, deﬁned as the number of channel uses required
per reliable exchange of message tuple. For the case of three users,
we have previously established that for a special class of source
distributions, the set of all achievable rates can be found [Ong
et al., ISIT 2010]. The class is speciﬁed by an almost balanced
conditional mutual information (ABCMI) condition. In this paper,
we ﬁrst generalize the ABCMI condition to the case of more than
three users. We then show that if the sources satisfy the ABCMI
condition, then the set of all achievable rates is found and can
be attained using a separate source-channel coding architecture.

Fig. 1. The ﬁnite ﬁeld MWRC in which L users (nodes 1, 2, . . . , L) exchange

with solid lines and the downlink channel with dotted lines.

This paper investigates multi-way relay channels (MWRCs)
where multiple users exchange correlated data via a relay. More
speciﬁcally, each user is to send its data to all other users. There
is no direct link among the users, and hence the users ﬁrst
transmit to a relay, which processes its received information
and transmits back to the users (refer to Fig. 1). The purpose
of this paper is to ﬁnd the set of all achievable rates, which
are deﬁned as the number of channel uses required to reliably
(in the usual Shannon sense) exchange each message tuple.
The joint source-channel coding problem in Fig. 1 includes,
as special cases, the source coding work of Wyner et al. [1]
and the channel capacity work of Ong et al. [2]. Separately,
the Shannon limits of source coding [1] (through noiseless
channel) and of channel coding [2] (with independent sources)
are well established. However, these limits have not yet been
discovered for noisy channels with correlated sources in general.
For three users, Ong et al. [3] gave sufﬁcient conditions
for reliable communication using the separate source-channel
coding paradigm. The key result of [3] was to show that these
sufﬁcient conditions are also necessary for a special class of
source distributions, hence giving the set of all achievable rates.
The class was characterized by an almost balanced conditional
mutual information (ABCMI) condition. This paper extends
the ABCMI concept to more than three users, and shows that
if the sources have ABCMI, then the set of all achievable rates
can be found. While the ABCMI condition for the three-user
case is expressed in terms of the standard Shannon information
measure, we will use I-Measure [4, Ch. 3] for more then three
users—using Shannon’s measure is possible but the expressions

would be much more complicated.
Though the ABCMI condition limits the class of sources for
which the set of all achievable rates is found, this paper provides
the following insights: (i) As achievability is derived based on
a separate source-channel coding architecture, we show that
source-channel separation is optimal for ﬁnite ﬁeld MWRC
with sources having ABCMI. (ii) Since ABCMI are constraints
on the sources, the results in this paper are potentially useful for
other channel models (not restricted to the ﬁnite ﬁeld model).
(iii) This paper highlights the usefulness of the I-Measure as a
complement to the standard Shannon information measure.
II. M AIN R ESULTS
A. The Network Model
1) Sources: Consider m independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) drawings of a tuple of correlated
discrete ﬁnite random variables (W1 , W2 , . . . , WL ), i.e.,
{(W1 [t], W2 [t], . . . , WL [t])}m . The message of user i is given
t=1
by W i = (Wi [1], Wi [2], . . . , Wi [m]).
2) Channel: Each channel use of the ﬁnite ﬁeld MWRC
consists of an uplink and L downlinks, characterized by
Uplink: Y0 = X1 ⊕ X2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ XL ⊕ NL

Downlinks:

Yi = X0 ⊕ Ni ,

(1)

for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L}, (2)

where X , Y , N , for all ∈ {0, 1, . . . , L}, each take values in
a ﬁnite ﬁeld F, ⊕ denotes addition over F, X is the channel

1

input from node , Y is the channel output received by node
, and N is the receiver noise at node . The noise N is
arbitrarily distributed, but is i.i.d. for each channel use. We
have used the subscript i to denote a user and the subscript
to denote a node (which can be a user or the relay).
3) Block Codes (joint source-channel codes with feedback):
Consider block codes for which the users exchange m message
tuples in n channel uses. [Encoding:] The t-th transmitted
channel symbol of node
is a function of its message
and the (t − 1) symbols it previously observed on the
downlink: X [t] = f [t](W , Y [1], Y [2], . . . , Y [t − 1]), for
all ∈ {0, 1, . . . , L} and for all t ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. As the relay
has no message, we set W 0 = ∅. [Decoding:] The messages
decoded by user i are a function of its message and the symbols
ˆ
it observed on the downlink: (W j,i : ∀j ∈ {1, . . . , L} \ {i}) =
hi (W i , Yi [1], Yi [2], . . . , Yi [n]), for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L}.
4) Achievable Rate: Let Pe denote the probability that
ˆ
W j,i = W i for any i = j. The rate (or bandwidth expansion
factor) of the code is the ratio of channel symbols to source
symbols, κ = n/m. The rate κ is said to be achievable if the
following is true: for any > 0, there exists a block code, with
n and m sufﬁciently large and n/m = κ, such that Pe < .

Remark 1: Theorem 1 characterizes a class of sources (on
any ﬁnite ﬁeld MWRC) for which (i) the set of all achievable
rates is known, and (ii) source-channel separation holds.
Remark 2: Slepian-Wolf type constraints of the form (4)
appear often in multi-terminal information theory. Since
Theorem 2 applies directly to such constraints, it might be
useful beyond its application here to the ﬁnite ﬁeld MWRC.
Remark 3: To prove Theorem 2, we need to select L nonnegative numbers that satisfy (2L − 2) equations.

III. D EFINITION OF ABCMI
A. The I-Measure
Consider L jointly distributed random variables (W1 , W2 ,
. . . , WL ). The Shannon measures of these random variables can
be efﬁciently characterized via set operations and the I-measure.
For each random variable Wi , we deﬁne a (corresponding) set
˜
˜
Wi . Let FL be the ﬁeld generated by {Wi } using the usual
set operations union ∪, intersection ∩, complement c , and
˜
difference −. The relationship between Wi and Wi is described
∗
by the I-Measure µ on FL , deﬁned as [4, Ch. 3]
˜
µ∗ (WS ) = H(WS ),
(5)

Theorem 1: Consider an L-user ﬁnite ﬁeld MWRC with
correlated sources. If the sources (W1 , W2 , . . . , WL ) have
almost balanced conditional mutual information (ABCMI),
then κ is achievable if and only if
H(W{1,2,...,L}\{i} |Wi )
.
(3)
κ≥

i∈{1,2,...,L} log2 |F| − max{H(N0 ), H(Ni )}
The ABCMI condition used in Theorem 1 is rather technical
and best deﬁned using the I-measure [4, Ch. 3]. For this reason,
we specify this condition later in Section III-B after giving
a brief review of the I-measure in Section III-A. For now, it
sufﬁces to note that it is a non-trivial constraint placed on the
joint distribution of (W1 , W2 , . . . , WL ).
The achievability (if assertion) of Theorem 1 is proved
using a separate source-channel coding architecture, which
involves intersecting a certain Slepian-Wolf source-coding
region with the ﬁnite ﬁeld MWRC capacity region [2]. The
particular source-coding region of interest is the classic SlepianWolf region [5] with the total sum-rate constraint omitted;
speciﬁcally, it is the set of all source-coding rate tuples
(r1 , r2 , . . . , rL ) such that

ri ≥ H(WS |W{1,2,...,L}\S )

for all K ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , L} where K
{1, 2, . . . , L} \ K. Note
that each atom corresponds to a unique K ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , L}. For
the atom in (6), we call |K| the weight of the atom.
Remark 4: The I-measure of the atoms corresponds to the
conditional mutual information of the variables. More speciﬁcally, µ∗ (a(K)) is the mutual information among the variables
{Wi : i ∈ K} conditioning on {Wj : j ∈ Kc }. For example, if
L = 4, then µ∗ (a(1, 2)) = I(W1 ; W2 |W3 , W4 ), where I(·) is
Shannon’s measure of conditional mutual information.
B. Almost Balanced Conditional Mutual Information
For each K ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L − 1}, we deﬁne
µK

µK

holds for all strict subsets S ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , L}. The next theorem
will be a critical step in the proof of Theorem 1.
Theorem 2: If L arbitrarily correlated random variables
(W1 , W2 , . . . , WL ) have ABCMI, then we can ﬁnd a nonnegative real tuple (r1 , r2 , . . . , rL ) such that
[C1] the inequality (4) holds for all subsets S ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , L}
for which 1 ≤ |S| ≤ L − 2,
[C2] the inequality (4) holds with equality for all subsets S ⊂
{1, 2, . . . , L} for which |S| = L − 1.

Fig. 2. Each row represents the contributions from a unique atom, and ri
is the summation of all cells, i.e., {Ji (·)}, in the i-th column. The hashed
region shows the contributions from all atoms with weight K to all ri ’s for i
in some set S.

We now evaluate the LHS of (12) for some ﬁxed i. Consider
some atom a(K) where i ∈ K. We evaluate the contributions

• The remaining (L − 1 − |K|) cells each contribute
− |K|−1 µ∗ (a(K)).

So, summing the contributions from a(K) to r −i , we have

IV. P ROOF OF T HEOREM 2
For the rest of this paper, we are interested in atoms only
with weight between one and (L − 1) inclusive. So, we deﬁne
K
{K ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , L} : 1 ≤ |K| ≤ L − 1} and refer to
A {a(K) : ∀K ∈ K} as the set of all such atoms.
We propose to select (r1 , r2 , . . . , rL ) in terms of the IMeasure:
(11)

Ji (K),

Jj (K)

K∈K

j∈{1,2,...,L}\{i}

where
Ji (K) =

L − |K|
|K| − 1 ∗
− (L − 1 − |K|)
µ (a(K)) (14a)
L−1
L−1
= µ∗ (a(K)).
(14b)
= |K|

+ L−|K| µ∗ (a(K)), if i ∈ K
L−1
− |K|−1 µ∗ (a(K)), otherwise, i.e., if i ∈ Kc .
L−1

Each ri is chosen as the sum of the weighted (by a
coefﬁcient + L−|K| or − |K|−1 ) I-measure of all atoms in A.
L−1
L−1
The assignments of ri ’s are depicted in Fig. 2. We term Ji (K)
the contribution from the atom a(K) to ri . Each contribution
is represented by a cell in Fig. 2, and each ri by a column.
We now show that conditions C1 and C2 in Theorem 2 hold
when the ri ’s are chosen as per (11).

Consider some atom a(K ) where i ∈ K . The contributions
from this atom to r −i are as follows (again, one speciﬁc row
in Fig. 2 less the cell Ji (K )):
• (|K | − 1) of the (L − 1) cells each contribute
L−|K | ∗
L−1 µ (a(K )).
• The remaining (L − |K |) cells each contribute
− |K |−1 µ∗ (a(K )).
L−1
So, summing the contributions from a(K ) to r −i , we have

A. For |S| = L − 1:

We ﬁrst show that for any i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , L}, we have
j∈{1,2,...,L}\{i}

rj = H(W{1,2,...,L}\{i} |Wi ).

Jj (K )
j∈{1,2,...,L}\{i}

(12)

L − |K |
|K | − 1 ∗
− (L − |K |)
µ (a(K )) = 0.
L−1
L−1
Combining the above results, we have, for a ﬁxed i,

= (|K | − 1)

Since ri ’s are deﬁned in terms of I-Measure, we link the
measure of atoms to the entropies of the corresponding random
variables:
˜

H(WS |WS c ) = µ∗ (WS − WS c )

where K

Remark 5: The ABCMI condition requires that all atoms of
the same weight (except for those with weight equal to zero,
one, or L) have about the same I-measure.
Remark 6: For any L, S, and K, such that 2 ≤ K ≤ S ≤
L − 2, it can be shown that α(L, S, K) ≥ β(L, S, K) ≥ 0.
Remark 7: For L = 3, we have µ2 ≤ 2µ2 , i.e., we recover
the ABCMI condition for the three-user case [3].
