“spatial coupling.” We will show that this coupling of graphs
leads to a remarkable change in their performance. Ensembles
designed in this way combine some of the nice elements of
polar codes (namely the fact that they are provably capacity
achieving under low complexity decoding) with the practical
advantages of sparse graph codes (the codes are competitive
already for moderate lengths). Perhaps most importantly, it
is possible to construct universal such codes for the whole
class of BMS channels. Here, universality refers to the fact
that one and the same ensemble is good for a whole class of
channels, assuming that at the receiver we have knowledge of
the channel.
The potential of spatially coupled codes has long been recognized. Our contribution lies therefore not in the introduction
of a new coding scheme, but in clarifying the mechanism that
make these codes perform so well.
The term spatially coupled codes was coined in [10].
Convolutional LDPC codes (more precisely, terminated convolutional LDPC codes), which were introduced by Felstr¨ m
o
and Zigangirov in [11], and their many variants belong to this
class. There is a considerable literature on convolutional-like
LDPC ensembles. Due to space constraints, we have to refer
the reader to the full version of this paper [12] for a thorough
review of the historical development.
It was recently shown in [10] that for transmission over the
BEC spatially coupled ensembles have a BP threshold which
is essentially equal to the MAP threshold of the underlying
uncoupled ensemble. Further, this threshold is also essentially
equal to the MAP threshold of the coupled ensemble. This
phenomena was called threshold saturation in [10] since the
BP threshold takes on its largest possible value (the MAP
threshold). This signiﬁcant improvement in the performance
is due to the spatial coupling of the underlying code. Those
“sections” of the code that have already succeeded in decoding
can help their neighboring less fortunate sections in the
decoding process. In this manner, the information propagates
from the “boundaries”, where the bits are known perfectly
towards the “middle”. In a recent paper [13], Lentmaier and
Fettweis independently formulated the same statement as a
conjecture and provided numerical evidence for its validity.

Abstract—We investigate spatially coupled code ensembles. For
transmission over the binary erasure channel, it was recently
shown that spatial coupling increases the belief propagation
threshold of the ensemble to essentially the maximum a-priori
threshold of the underlying component ensemble. This explains
why convolutional LDPC ensembles, originally introduced by
Felstr¨ m and Zigangirov, perform so well over this channel.
o
We show that the equivalent result holds true for transmission
over general binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels. More precisely, given a desired error probability and a gap
to capacity, we can construct a spatially coupled ensemble which
fulﬁlls these constraints universally on this class of channels under
belief propagation decoding. In fact, most codes in that ensemble
have that property. The quantiﬁer universal refers to the single
ensemble/code which is good for all channels if we assume that
the channel is known at the receiver.
The key technical result is a proof that under belief propagation decoding spatially coupled ensembles achieve essentially the
area threshold of the underlying uncoupled ensemble.
We conclude by discussing some interesting open problems.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Ever since the publication of Shannon’s seminal paper [1]
and the introduction of the ﬁrst coding schemes by Hamming [2] and Golay [3], coding theory has been concerned
with ﬁnding low-delay and low-complexity capacity-achieving
schemes. The interested reader can ﬁnd an excellent historical
review in [4].
In the past 20 years much research has centered on codes on
graphs, in particular turbo codes and low-density parity-check
(LDPC) codes. These codes are imminently practical since
they can be designed to have very good performance when
decoded via low complexity message-passing algorithms. A
central research topic for these codes is the interaction of the
graphical structure of a code and its performance. Turbo codes
themselves are a prime example how the “right” structure is
important to achieve good performance [5]. Further important
parameters and structures are, the degree distribution (dd) and
in particular the fraction of degree-two variable nodes, multiedge ensembles [6], degree-two nodes in a chain [7], and
protographs [8], [9].
Our main aim is to explain the role of a further structural
element in the realm of sparse graph codes, namely that of

case take a FP (cσ , xσ ) and deﬁne y = xσ dr −1 . Then

Belief propagation (BP) thresholds for transmission over
general BMS channels were computed by means of a numerical procedure by Lentmaier, Sridharan, Zigangirov and
Costello in [14]. Further, in [15] (conjectured) MAP thresholds
for some LDPC ensembles were computed according to the
Maxwell construction. Comparing these two values, one can
check empirically that also for transmission over general
BMS channels the BP threshold of the coupled ensembles is
essentially equal to the (conjectured) MAP threshold of the
underlying ensemble. Indeed, recently both [16] as well as
[17] provided further numerical evidence that the threshold
saturation phenomenon also applies to general BMS channels.
We prove that this indeed the case. More precisely, we
show that for general BMS channels, spatially coupled ensembles achieve the so-called area threshold of the underlying
ensemble. As a consequence, given a desired error probability
and a gap to capacity, we can construct a spatially coupled
ensemble which fulﬁlls these constraints universally on this
class of channels under belief propagation decoding. In fact,
most codes in that ensemble have that property. The quantiﬁer
universal refers to the single ensemble/code which is good
for all channels if we assume that the channel is known at the
receiver.
Although this paper is only concerned with coding, let us
remark that there is to date a fairly extensive literature on the
analysis of spatially coupled codes, and more generally, the
principle of spatial coupling applied to problems in communications, computer science, compressive sensing, and statistical
physics. For a detailed discussion please see [12].

for a family of FPs {cσ , xσ }. This is shown in Figure 1 for
the (3, 6)-regular ensemble assuming that transmission takes
place over the BAWGNC. To plot Figure 1 we have used
the procedure in [15], referred there as reverse DE, to get
a complete family of FPs for all entropies from 0 to 1. For a
detailed discussion we refer the reader to [15], [18].

II. U NCOUPLED S YSTEMS
Throughout the paper we consider transmission over binaryinput memoryless output-symmetric (BMS) channels. More
precisely we will assume that the channel belongs to an
ordered, complete and smooth family (for deﬁnition see [18]).
Also, we limit our investigation to the analysis of the BP
decoder. We are interested in the asymptotic performance of
the BP decoder, i.e., the performance when the blocklength n
tends to inﬁnity. This asymptotic performance is characterized
by the so-called density evolution (DE) equation [19].
In the sequel we use H(.) and B(.) to denote the entropy
and Battacharyya parameters respectively. Also, the symmetric
densities appearing are denoted in the L-domain [18]. Fixedpoints (FPs) of DE play a crucial role in the asymptotic analysis of the BP decoder. E.g., the BP threshold is characterized
by the existence/non-existence of a non-trivial FP of forward
DE (iterating DE equations starting with the density ∆0 ) for
a particular channel. An even more powerful picture arises if
instead of looking at a single FP at a time we visualize a whole
collection of FPs. In order to visualize many FPs at the same
time it is convenient to project them. For BEC the projection
of choice is the EXIT functional (see [18]).
A good choice for the projection operator for general
channels is the GEXIT functional [15]. For the BEC this
coincides with the EXIT functional (see [18]). For the general

For the BEC it is easy to see that the area enclosed by the
GEXIT curve is equal to the design rate [18]. We will show
that a similar statement holds also for the case of more general
channels. This property is one of the main ingredients in our
proof.
A. Existence of GEXIT Curve
For the BEC it is trivial to see that the BP GEXIT curve
indeed exists. But for general BMS channels this is not
immediate. We ﬁrst recall a lemma from [15] which shows
that indeed for a subset of parameters, the BP GEXIT curve
indeed exists and is smooth. For the proofs of the ensuing
lemmas we refer the reader to [12].
Lemma 1 (Sufﬁcient Condition for Continuity): Assume
that communication takes place over an ordered and complete
family {ch }h , where h = H(ch ), using the dd pair (dl , dr ).
Then, for any h ∈ [0, 1], there exists at most one density xh
so that (ch , xh ) forms a FP which fulﬁlls
B(ch )(dl − 1)(dr − 1)(1 − B(xh )2 )dr −2 < 1 .

(1)

Furthermore, if such a density xh exists, then it coincides with
the forward DE FP. Finally, B(xh ) is Lipschitz continuous
with respect to B(ch ). More precisely, if two FPs (ch1 , xh1 )

2

and (ch2 , xh2 ) satisfy the condition B(chi )(dl − 1)(dr − 1)(1 −
B(xhi )2 )dr −2 ≤ 1 − δ for some δ > 0, then

Deﬁnition 5 (GEXIT Integral of Ensemble): Consider the
(dl , dr )-regular ensemble and assume that {cσ , xσ }σ is a
σ
family of FPs of DE. Deﬁne yσ = xσ dr −1 . Then

The following lemma states that, at least for sufﬁciently
large entropies, the BP GEXIT curve indeed exists and is well
behaved.
Lemma 2 (Continuity For Large Entropies): Assume that
communication takes place over an ordered and complete
family {ch }h , where h = H(ch ), using the dd pair (dl , dr ).
Consider the set of FP pairs {(ch , xh )} obtained by applying
forward DE to each channel ch . Let

b(x) = (dl − 1)2 (dr − 1)2 x(1 − x)2(dr −2) ,

Let x be the unique solution in (0, 1] of the equation
˜
a(x) − b(x) = 0. Then the family {(ch , xh )}1 ˜(d ,dr ,{ch }) ,
h=h l
˜
with h(dl , dr , {ch }) = hBMS (c(˜)), satisﬁes (1), is Lipschitz
x
continuous wrt to the Battacharyya parameter of the channel,
where hBMS (·) is the function which maps the Battacharyya
constant of an element of the family to the corresponding
˜
entropy. Further, B(xh ) > 0 for all h ≥ h(dl , dr , {ch }).
The following lemma gives a universal and analytical lower
bound on the entropy.
Lemma 3 (Universal Bound on Continuity Region):
Assume that communication takes place over an ordered
and complete family {ch }h , where h = H(ch ), using the
dd pair (dl , dr ) with dr ≥ 4 and dl ≥ 3. Let a(x) be deﬁned
as in Lemma 2. Consider the set of FP pairs {(ch , xh )} which
is derived by applying forward DE to each channel ch . Then
the GEXIT curve associated to {(ch , xh )}h>h , where
1

x = 1 − ((dl − 1)(dr − 1))− dr −2 , h =

where A(xh , dl , dr ) is equal to A, which is given in Lemma 6,
evaluated at the FP xh , when transmitting with the (dl , dr )regular ensemble.
Note that A(∆+∞ , dl , dr ) = 0 and that xh = ∆+∞ for
all h < hBP (dl , dr , {ch }). Therefore the set over which we
take the supremum is non-empty and hBP (dl , dr , {ch }) ≤
hA (dl , dr , {ch }).
Recall that the GEXIT integral has a simple graphical
interpretation – it is the area under the GEXIT curve, assuming
of course that both the curve and the integral exist. The area
threshold is therefore that channel parameter hA (dl , dr , {ch })
such that the GEXIT integral from hA (dl , dr , {ch }) to 1 is
dl
equal to 1 − dr , the design rate.
Lemma 8 (Area Threshold Approaches Shannon):
Consider a sequence of (dl , dr )-regular ensembles of
ﬁxed design rate r = 1 − dl /dr and with dl , dr tending to
inﬁnity.

B. Area Theorem and the Area threshold
In the previous we derived conditions which guarantee that
the BP GEXIT curve indeed exists and is continuous in a
given region. We will now discuss the GEXIT integral, the area
under the GEXIT curve. In order to derive some properties
of this integral, we will ﬁrst introduce GEXIT integrals in a
slightly more general form before we apply them to ensembles.

C. Main Result
Theorem 10 (BP Threshold of the (dl , dr , L, w) Ensemble):
Consider transmission over a complete, smooth, and ordered
family of BMS channels, denote it by {ch }, using the
admissible ensemble (dl , dr , L, w). Let hBP (dl , dr , L, w, {ch })
and hMAP (dl , dr , L, w, {ch }) denote the corresponding BP and
MAP threshold. Further, let R(dl , dr , L, w) denote the design
rate of this ensemble and set r = 1 − dl /dr . Finally, let
hA (dl , dr , {ch }) denote the area threshold of the underlying
(dl , dr )-regular ensemble and the given channel family. Then

A. Spatially Coupled Ensemble
Our goal is to show that coupled ensembles can achieve
capacity on general BMS channels. Let us recall the deﬁnition
of an ensemble which is particularly suited for the purpose of
analysis. We call it the (dl , dr , L, w) ensemble, sse [12] for
variants. The variable nodes of the ensemble are at positions
[−L, L], L ∈ N. At each position there are M variable nodes,
M ∈ N. Conceptually we think of the check nodes to be
located at all integer positions from [−∞, ∞]. Only some
of these positions actually interact with the variable nodes.
dl
At each position there are dr M check nodes. It remains to
describe how the connections are chosen. We assume that
each of the dl connections of a variable node at position
i is uniformly and independently chosen from the range
[i, . . . , i + w − 1], where w is a “smoothing” parameter. In
the same way, we assume that each of the dr connections
of a check node at position i is independently chosen from
the range [i − w + 1, . . . , i]. A detailed construction of this
ensemble can be found in [10]. For the paper we will always
be interested in the limit when M tends to inﬁnity while L as
well as dl and dr stay ﬁxed. In this limit we can analyze
the system via DE, simplifying our task. Not surprisingly,
spatially coupled ensembles inherit many of their properties
from the underlying ensemble. Perhaps most importantly, the
local connectivity is the same. Further, the design rates are
also close, see [10].

w
dd (dl , dr ) and w but is universal wrt the channel family {ch }.
dl
Furthermore, limw→∞ limL→∞ R(dl , dr , L, w) = 1 − dr .
Discussion:

(i) The bound hBP ≤ hMAP is trivial and only listed for
completeness. The upper bound on the MAP threshold of
the coupled ensemble is obtained by using the circular
ensemble deﬁned in [12]. We ﬁrst provide a lower bound
on the conditional entropy for the circular ensemble
when transmitting over a BMS channel with entropy h.
This is obtained by observing that the BP GEXIT curve
for the circular ensemble and the underlying uncoupled
ensemble are the same. We then show that setting w − 1
sections to 0 does not signiﬁcantly decrease this entropy.
Overall this gives an upper bound on the MAP threshold
of the coupled ensemble in terms of the area threshold
of the underlying ensemble. For details see [12].
(ii) The lower bound on hBP (dl , dr , L, w, {ch }) expressed in
(3) is the main result of this paper. It shows that, up to
a term which tends to zero when w tends to inﬁnity, the
BP threshold of the coupled ensemble is at least as large
as the area threshold of the underlying ensemble.
Empirical evidence suggests that the convergence speed
wrt w is exponential. Our bound only guarantees a
convergence speed of order 1/w.

B. Admissible Parameters
Deﬁnition 9 (Admissible Parameters): Fix the design rate r
of the uncoupled system. We say that the parameters (dl , dr )
and w are admissible if the following conditions are fulﬁlled
dl
with r = 1 − dr :
√

(i) dr ≥ 3b ln(b), b = ln(4/3)(1−r) ,

(iii) h(dl , dr , {ch }) ≤ (1 − r)(1 − dr e−4(dr −1)( 11e ) 3 ) − dr ,

where h(dl , dr , {ch }) is the bound stated in Lemma 2,
(iv) w > 2d3 d2 ,
l r
√
r
(v) w > 2(dl − 1)(dr − 1)( 16 2dl )2 ,
ln(2)d
√
2
2
(vi) w > 2(dl − 1)(dr − 1)dr (4( 2 + ln 2 dl (dr − 1)))2 ,

The proof of this theorem is long and is done in [12].

We say that the ensemble (dl , dr , L, w) is admissible if the
parameters (dl , dr ) and w are admissible. If we are only
concerned about the conditions on (dl , dr ), then we will say
that (dl , dr ) is admissible.
Discussion: Conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) are fulﬁlled if we take
the degrees sufﬁciently large. Conditions (iv), (v), and (vi) can
all be fulﬁlled by picking a sufﬁciently large connection width
w. Numerical experiments indicated that for any 3 ≤ dl ≤ dr
and w ≥ 2 the threshold saturation phenomenon happens, with
a “wiggle-size” which vanishes exponentially in w.

D. Extensions
In Theorem 10 we start with a smooth, complete and
ordered channel family. But it is straightforward to convert
this theorem and to apply it directly to single channels or to a
collection of channels. The next statement makes this precise.
Corollary 11 ((dl , dr , L, w) Universally Achieves Capacity):
The (dl , dr , L, w) ensemble is universally capacity achieving
for the class of BMS channels. More precisely, assume we
are given > 0 and a target rate R. Let C(R) denote the set

4

of BMS channels of capacity at least R. To each c ∈ C(R)
associate the family {ch }1 , by deﬁning
h=0
ch =

1
H(c) [(H(c) − h)∆+∞

1−H(c) [(h − H(c))∆0

+ hc],

scheduling (e.g., windowed decoding) to control the decoder
complexity [16]. The threshold saturation phenomenon has
been empirically found to hold in a large variety of systems.
This suggests that one should be able to formulate a rather
general theory rather than ﬁnding a separate proof for each of
these cases. For all one-dimensional systems this has recently
been accomplished in [12]. For higher-dimensional or inﬁnitedimensional systems this is a challenging open problem.

0 ≤ h ≤ H(c),

+ (1 − h))c], H(c) ≤ h ≤ 1.

Then there exists a set of parameters (dl , dr , L, w) so that
R(dl , dr , L, w) ≥ R − 4 ,
inf hBP (dl , dr , L, w, {ch }) ≥ 1 − R + .

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

c∈C(R)

The work of R. Urbanke was supported by the European
project STAMINA, 265496.

Since for each c ∈ C(R) the associated family {ch }1
h=0 is
ordered by degradation, this implies that we can transmit with
this ensemble reliably over each of the channels in C(R) with
rate at least R − 4 , i.e., arbitrarily close to the Shannon limit.
Corollary 12 (Universally Capacity Achieving Codes):
Assume we are given > 0 and a target rate R. Let C(R)
denote the set of BMS channels of capacity at least R. Then
there exists a set of parameters (dl , dr , L, w) of rate at least
R − 5 with the following property. Let C(n) be an element
of (dl , dr , L, w) with blocklength n, where we assume that n
only goes over the subsequence of admissible values. Then

IV. C ONCLUSION AND O UTLOOK
We have shown that one can construct low-complexity coding schemes which are universal for the whole class of BMS
channels by spatially coupling regular LDPC ensembles. Thus,
we resolve a long-standing open problem of whether there
exist low-density parity-check ensembles which are capacityachieving using BP decoding. These ensembles are not only
attractive in an asymptotic setting but also for applications and
standards since they can easily be designed to have both, good
thresholds and low error ﬂoors. In addition, these ensembles
are universal in the sense that one and the same ensemble
is good for the whole class of BMS channels, assuming
that the channel is known at the receiver. In fact, we have
shown the stronger statement that almost all codes in such
an ensemble are good for all channels in this class. Let us
discuss some open questions. If one can establish that the
MAP threshold of the uncoupled ensemble is at least as large
as the MAP threshold of the coupled ensemble, then using
the main theorem above the Maxwell conjecture [18] would
be proved. Another important challenge would be to show
that the convergence speed to the Shannon limit is much
faster than we can actually prove, as is observed in practice.
From a practical point of view, a ﬁrm understanding is needed
of how the performance of such codes scale in each of the
parameters in dl , dr , L, M , w. This would permit to design
codes in a principled fashion. Further important topics are, the
design of good termination schemes to mitigate the rate-loss, a
systematic investigation of how structure in the interconnection
pattern as well as the codes inﬂuences the performance, and
