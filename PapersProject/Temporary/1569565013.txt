Abstract— We consider bit-interleaved coded modulation
(BICM) schemes where, instead of the true bit or symbol
probabilities and the constellation used at the transmitter, the
decoder uses arbitrary probabilities or reference constellations.
We study the corresponding low- and high- signal-to-noise-ratio
regimes and show that even in the presence of this extra sources
of mismatch, BICM has a negligible penalty with respect to coded
modulation.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) was introduced
by Zehavi [1] as a pragmatic coding scheme for combining
coding and modulation to achieve high spectral efﬁciency. It
was later extensively studied by Caire et al. [2] under the assumption of inﬁnite depth interleaving, where it is argued that
the system essentially behaves as a set of parallel independent
memoryless binary-input output-symmetric channels.
In a recent work by Martinez et al. [3], [4], the BICM
decoder has been cast as a mismatched decoder [5], [6]. The
model is extended to account for shaping in [7], i.e., the bit or
symbol probabilities are optimized. The restriction of inﬁnite
depth interleaving was lifted with this mismatched decoder
framework and the generalized mutual information (GMI) is
used to measure the achievable rates. When the classical BICM
decoder as in [4], [7] is used, the mismatch solely comes from
the assumption of independent bit metrics. It was found in
[7], [8] that for the AWGN channel, this mismatch can be
mostly recovered by shaping, virtually closing the gap that
made BICM suboptimal compared to coded modulation (CM)
in terms of information rates. In particular, in the low signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) regime, BICM with shaping becomes ﬁrstand second-order optimal [7], [8].
In this paper, we take a closer look at shaping and the
BICM mismatched decoder. In particular, we consider a generalized BICM decoder where one decodes using arbitrary bit
or symbol probabilities and reference constellations instead
of the true ones that used at the transmitter. The resulting
additional source of mismatch might reduce the complexity
of the decoder of BICM shaping schemes in [7]. We also

analytically study the behavior of this doubly-mismatched
decoder in the low SNR regime, and show that our scheme
can be made ﬁrst- and second-order optimal. Finally, we also
provide a framework for studying the behavior of BICM GMI
in the high SNR regime, more speciﬁcally, in the saturation
region.
II. C HANNEL M ODEL AND C ODE E NSEMBLES
A. Channel Model
We consider transmission of information with a block code
of length N and rate R. At the transmitter, a message m is
mapped into a codeword x(m) = (x1 (m), . . . , xN (m)), where
xk (m) ∈ X , and X is the channel input alphabet. Let M
|X | and m log2 (M ) denotes the cardinality of X and the
number of bits per symbol, respectively.
The output y = (y1 , . . . , yN ) is a random transformation of
the input with transition probability distribution PY |X (y|x).
We assume memoryless channels, therefore
N

PY |X (y|x) =
k=1

PY |X (yk |xk ),

(1)

where PY |X (y|x) is the channel transition probability, and
X, Y denote the underlying random variables taking values
on the input and output alphabet X , Y.
The decoder decides on the estimate of the message m according to a decoding metric q(x, y). We assume a maximum
metric decoder given by
N

m = arg max q(x(m), y) = arg max
m

m

q(xk (m), yk ). (2)
k=1

When the metric q(x, y) is a strictly increasing bijective
function of PY |X (y|x), the decoder will always select the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) codeword. Otherwise, we have
a mismatched decoder [5], [6].
B. Coded Modulation (CM)
The random coding ensemble corresponding to CM has
channel inputs selected i.i.d. from X according to a probability distribution PX (x). The CM decoder employs the MAP
metric. The largest information rate that can be achieved with
CM under the constraint x ∈ X is
Ccm = sup I(X; Y ).

BICM S CHEMES OF I NTEREST

In a BICM scheme, the codewords are obtained as the
serial concatenation of a binary codeword of length n =
mN , a bit-level interleaver1, and a binary labeling function
µ : {0, 1}m → X which takes blocks of m bits and
maps the m bits to signal constellation symbols x, such that
xk = µ b(k−1)m+1 , . . . , bkm , k = 1, . . . , N . We denote the
inverse labeling function by bj : X → {0, 1}, so that bj (x)
is the j-th bit in the binary label of modulation symbol x,
for j = 1, . . . , m. With slight abuse of notation, we let
B1 , . . . , Bm and b1 , . . . , bm denote the random variables and
their corresponding realizations of the bits in a given label
position j = 1, . . . , m. In this paper, we consider the case
where the modulation symbols x are used with probabilities

Since Eq. (8) gives an achievable rate for the distribution
bicm
PX , one can ﬁnd the input bit distribution with largest GMI,
resulting in probabilistic shaping, by solving

bicm
Note that maximization over PX (x) is equivalent to maximization over PB1 (b), . . . , PBm (b).
Due to the non-convex, non-concave nature of the BICM
GMI, there is no simple algorithmic way to ﬁnd the suboptimal
bicm
values of s and PX . For discrete memoryless channels,
we derived a Blahut-Arimoto type of algorithm that ﬁnds the
bicm
optimal PX (x) for ﬁxed s and guarantees local optimality
bicm
[9]. As Ibicm (s, PX ) is a concave function of s, one can
also optimize over s without resorting to exhaustive search.

and study both low- and high-SNR regimes.

The largest achievable rate with mismatched decoding is
not known in general. However, the GMI has been shown to
be the largest achievable rate with i.i.d. codebooks [5], [6].

In summary, BICM0 is classical BICM with equiprobable
symbols, BICM1 is BICM with optimized symbol probabilities
solving (11). In BICM2 and BICM3 , the symbol probabilities
at the transmitter are optimized based on a mismatched receiver that assumes equiprobable symbols. The main difference between BICM2 and BICM3 is that BICM3 knows the
energy of the transmitted constellation (hence the reference
constellation is exactly X ), while BICM2 does not (hence the
reference constellation and the transmitted constellation are
mismatched).
Figure 1 shows the performance comparison among the four
BICM schemes featured in Table I. The capacity of CM is also
shown for reference. The results illustrate that the mismatched
ˆ
symbol pmf QX|Bj (x|b) and/or mismatched constellation X
are efﬁciently compensated by shaping at low SNR. On the
other hand, in the mid-to-high range of SNR, BICM2 performs
only slightly better than BICM0 . We also observe that as
soon as the reference constellation matches the transmit constellation (As in BICM3 ) while keeping equiprobable symbol
probabilities at the decoder, the gap can be recovered almost
in full.

Fig. 1. Comparison of Cbicm among different BICM schemes with 8PAM
modulation with Gray labeling. Schemes are shown as in Table I.

A scheme is said to be ﬁrst- and second-order optimal if c1 = 1
1
and c2 = − 2 [10].

The low-snr performance of BICM was studied in [11],
where expressions of c1 and c2 were given for general mapping
rules and equiprobable signaling with the classical BICM
decoder (5). The result was exploited in [7] to show that
BICM with Gray labeling and shaping is ﬁrst- and secondorder optimal in the wideband regime. To generalize the result
in [11] and to determine how the multiple sources of mismatch
introduced in this paper affect c1 and c2 , we start directly with
the expression of Ibicm (snr) deﬁned in Eq. (12). For simplicity,
we use natural logarithms. In order to ﬁnd c1 and c2 , we need
the second- and forth-order derivatives of fj (ρ, x, b, s) with
respect to ρ, respectively.
The ﬁrst-order derivative of fj (ρ, x, b, s) with respect to ρ
is given by [9]

B. Low-SNR Regime
The GMI of BICM at mid-to-high-SNR can only be evaluated by numerical experiments. On the other hand, at low
SNR, the GMI can be analyzed in closed form. The GMI
admits a Taylor expansion series in terms of snr,
Ibicm (snr) = c1 snr + c2 snr2 + o(snr2 ).

regime analysis of the general BICM schemes.
C. High-SNR Regime
Both mutual information and GMI are upper bounded by
H(X), the input entropy. Furthermore, for high SNR the
equivocation H(X|Y ) tends to zero, and therefore, the mutual
information of CM saturates at H(X), making equiprobable
inputs optimal at high SNR. In this section, we analyze the

We now focus on the high-SNR behavior of Hsnr (X|Y ).
When snr → ∞, for ﬁxed b and y (or x), the channel tends
to a noiseless channel, and the limiting value of the log term
in (29) can be calculated as

When snr → ∞, the term Hsnr (X|Y ) in (29) converges to (32)
at the bottom of the page. This characterizes the saturating
value of the GMI for high SNR for a general reference
constellation. In particular, for schemes with equal transmit
ˆ
and reference constellation, i.e., X = X , Eq. (30) tends to
0 at high SNR, hence Eq. (32) also tends to 0 at high SNR,

We have studied the performance in terms of achievable
rates of BICM with mismatched shaping strategies. We have
considered schemes where the decoder employs a reference
constellation that assumes that the symbols have been used
with equal probability and we have studied both low- and
high-SNR regimes. We have seen that the loss of this scheme
with respect to a fully optimized BICM scheme is marginal at
low SNR. In the case the decoder uses the same constellation
as the transmitter while still assuming equiprobable symbols,
the loss is negligible in all the range of SNRs.

ﬁxing PB2 (0) = 0 and maximizing PB1 (0), PB3 (0), s. The horizontal

and Ibicm (snr) saturates at H(X). However, when X = X ,
Eq. (30) may not be 0, and Ibicm (snr) in Eq. (28) does not
necessarily converge to H(X).
Using H¨ lder’s inequality, one can easily verify that
o
ˆ
limsnr→∞ Hsnr (X|Y ) is a convex function of s. Hence, simple
numerical methods can be used to optimize Eq. (28) for ﬁxed

PX (x). Optimization over PX (x) can then be performed
through exhaustive search.
Figure 3 shows numerical evidence of the above analysis. In

particular, we consider 8-PAM, with X = X . As we can see, in
some cases, the resulting GMI does not saturate at the integer
bits, but rather to the values predicted by (32). We can interpret
the GMI for BICM2 (thin solid line) as the envelope of all
