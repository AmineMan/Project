Abstract—Ergodic interference alignment, as introduced by
Nazer et al (NGJV), is a technique that allows high-rate communication in n-user interference networks with fast fading. It works
by splitting communication across a pair of fading matrices.
However, it comes with the overhead of a long time delay until
2
matchable matrices occur: the delay is q n for ﬁeld size q.
In this paper, we outline two new families of schemes, called
JAP and JAP-B, that reduce the expected delay, sometimes at the
cost of a reduction in rate from the NGJV scheme. In particular,
we give examples of good schemes for networks with few users,
and show that in large n-user networks, the delay scales like q T ,
where T is quadratic in n for a constant per-user rate and T
is constant for a constant sum-rate. We also show that half the
single-user rate can be achieved while reducing NGJV’s delay
2
from q n to q (n−1)(n−2) .

In Section IV, we deﬁne a new family of schemes, called
JAP (Subsection IV-A), a beamforming extension JAP-B (Subsection IV-B), and child schemes derived from them (Section
IV-D) that have lower time delays than the NGJV scheme for a
variety of different rates, answering Question 2. As a special
case, the JAP-B(n) schemes (Subsection IV-C) achieve half
the single-user rate, like NGJV, while reducing the delay from
2
q n to q (n−1)(n−2) , answering Question 1. In Section V, we
answer Questions 3 and 4, by ﬁnding and analysing the JAPB schemes that perform the best for small and large n; Table
1 and Figure 1 illustrate the best schemes for small n, and
Theorems 6 and 7 give the asymptotic behaviour. Question 5
remains an open problem, although we do give bounds on the
delay achievable for the best schemes listed above.
Koo, Wu and Gill [7] have attempted to answer Questions
2 and 3. We brieﬂy outline their work in Section III.
A slightly longer version of this paper is available online
[8], with more detailed results and complete proofs.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Interference alignment [1], [2] describes a set of techniques
that allow communication in multiuser networks at much
higher rates than standard resource division schemes such as
TDMA. Interference alignment schemes work by ‘aligning’ all
interfering signals so they can be cancelled together.
Given a fast-fading channel – that is a channel with independent and identically distributed (IID) fading coefﬁcients
in each time slot – Nazer, Gastpar, Jafar and Vishwanath [3]
proposed a scheme, which we call the NGJV scheme. In brief,
the NGJV scheme pairs together communications using fading
matrix H with those using fading matrix I − H, providing a
situation with no interference between receivers. (We outline
the NGJV scheme in more detail in Section III.)
The NGJV scheme can be regarded as optimal for an nuser interference network, since half the single-user rate is
achievable for each user, no matter how large n is [3], [4],
[5], [6]. However, this is achieved at the cost of a signiﬁcant
delay in communications.
For deﬁniteness, we consider a model of communication
over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq of size q. Since the NGJV scheme requires
a particular n × n channel matrix with entries in Fq \ {0} to
2
occur, the expected delay for a given message is (q − 1)n ,
2
which is roughly q n for large q. It is clear that even for n
and q relatively small, this is not a practical delay. For n = 6
and q = 3, for example, the delay is 236 ≈ 7 × 1010 .
There are ﬁve questions we would like to try to answer:
1) Can we ﬁnd a scheme that, like NGJV, achieves half the
single-user rate, but has a shorter delay?

II. M ODEL : T HE FINITE FIELD CHANNEL
Since ergodic interference alignment relies on matrices
being exactly aligned, Nazer et al [3] give their main results
in the context of the ﬁnite ﬁeld channel, where there are
only ﬁnitely-many possible fading matrices. They then use a
quantisation argument to apply their results to the Gaussian
case. In order to allow comparison of our results, we use the
same ﬁnite ﬁeld model.
Each transmitter i has an independent message wi ∈ Fmi ,
q
which it encodes as a codeword (xi [1], . . . , xi [N ]) of block
length N , giving rate Ri = (log q mi )/N = mi log q.

At time t, receiver j sees channel output

and needs to decode the message wj . We can rewrite (1) in
matrix form as Y[t] = H[t]x[t] + Z[t]. (Throughout, matrices
are in sans-serif and vectors in bold.) We call H[t] the channel
matrix or fading matrix. As in [3], the noise terms Zj [t] are
IID sequences from a distribution on Fq that is a mixture of
a uniform distribution and a point mass at zero:
Zj =

0
z ∈ {1, . . . , q − 1}

We deﬁne the expected time delay for the NGJV scheme to
be the average number of time slots we must wait after seeing
a channel matrix H until we see the corresponding matrix
I − H. The time delay is geometrically distributed with mean
1/p, where p is the probability that the random channel matrix
takes the value I − H. Hence ﬁnding the average time delay
is reduced to ﬁnding the probability that the desired matrix
appears in the next time slot. Since a channel matrix has n2
entries, each of which needs to take the correct one value of
q − 1 possible values, the average time delay is

with prob. 1 − ρ,
with prob. ρ/(q − 1),

Like [3], we use an ‘ergodic’ model, where the channel
coefﬁcients Hji [t] are drawn IID and uniformly from the ﬁeld
Fq \ {0} and are redrawn for each time slot.
We assume all transmitters and receivers have full causal
channel state information for all transmitter–receiver pairs.
By a simple mutual information maximisation, it is easy to
show that the capacity of the single-user ﬁnite ﬁeld channel
Y = Hx + Z for a constant H = 0 is D(Z) := log q − H(Z),
where H(Z) is the entropy of Z.
Schemes for the ﬁnite ﬁeld interference channel often allow
each user pair to achieve a ﬁxed fraction of the single-user rate.
We refer to the ‘pre-D(Z) term’ as the degrees of freedom.
Deﬁnition 1: Given an achievable symmetric rate point
(R, . . . , R), we deﬁne the degrees of freedom to be DOF =
R/D(Z).
In particular, a single user can achieve 1 degree of freedom.

= (q − 1)n ∼ q n .

(2)

(Here and elsewhere, we write f (q) ∼ g(q) if f (q)/g(q) → 1
as q → ∞.)
Since this expected delay will be quite large even for modest
values of q and n, we will concentrate on the delay exponent.
Deﬁnition 2: An interference alignment scheme with expected delay D ∼ Cq T for some C and T has delay exponent
T and delay constant C. Formally, T := limq→∞ log D/ log q.
Reduction of the delay exponent is the key aim, with the
delay coefﬁcient playing a secondary role. Since the ﬁnite ﬁeld
model is in some sense an a quantisation of the continuous
case, q should be large enough for accurate quantisation.
Alternatively, for ﬁxed quantisation quality, SNR scales like
q 2 , so the high-SNR region corresponds to large q. When q is
large, the delay exponent T dominates the delay constant C
in determining size of the expected delay D.
From (2), we see that the NGJV scheme, which achieves
DOF = 1/2, has a delay exponent of n2 .
For comparison, time-division multiple access (TDMA),
where each transmitter–receiver pair has sole access to the
channel for an nth of the total time, achieves DOF = 1/n for
an expected delay D = n = nq 0 , and hence a delay exponent
of T = 0. To an extent, our new schemes can be seen as
‘interpolating’ between the extremes of NGJV (high rate, high
delay) and TDMA (low rate, low delay).
We also mention some new schemes due to Koo, Wu and
Gill [7] (KWG). They attempted to answer Questions 2 and
3, by ﬁnding schemes with lower delay than NGJV. The
KWG schemes suggest matching a larger class of matrices
than simply H and I − H. By analysing the hitting probability
of an associated Markov chain, they were able to reduce the
expected delay, at the cost of a reduction in rate and hence
degrees of freedom. However, their schemes only affect the
delay by a constant multiple, with the most successful scheme
2
2
only reducing the delay to 0.64(q −1)n ∼ 0.64q n for a sumrate of 0.79D(Z). That is, they only reduce the delay constant
C, leaving the delay exponent as T = n2 . For modest q and
n, say q = 3, n = 6, again, we regard this delay as still
impractical. Since the KWG schemes achieve a lower rate than
the NGJV scheme for the same delay exponent, we need only
compare our results with the NGJV scheme.

III. T HREE EXISTING SCHEMES :
NGJV, KWG AND TDMA
The NGJV scheme [3] is based on an idea from previous
work of Nazer and Gastpar [9] involving the performance of
ﬁnite-ﬁeld multiple-access channels.
Each receiver’s problem takes the form of (1). Rather
than reconstructing a single message wj (or all messages
w1 , w2 , . . . , wn ) as receiver j would normally wish to do,
it can be shown [9, Theorem 1], [3, Lemma 3] that receiver
n
j can actually recover the ‘pseudomessage’ i=1 Hji wi at
rate D(Z). This is done by all transmitters using the same
linear code, so for all i, (xi [1], . . . , xi [N ]) = Gwi , for an
appropriate m × N generator matrix G.
The NGJV scheme works as follows. Each transmitter i
sends two signals encoding the same message wi ; ﬁrst when
the channel matrix is H, and second when the channel matrix
is H := I − H. In the ﬁrst time slot, each receiver j can
n
decode the pseudomessage i=1 Hji wi , using the argument
above. The receiver stores this pseudomessage in its memory.
In the second time slot it can decode the pseudomessage
n
i=1 Hji wi , which it also stores in its memory. The receiver
then adds together these two estimates of pseudomessages, to
get its own message
n

1
n2

q−1

i=1

Since both pseudomessages can be communiated at rate D(Z),
we conclude that each transmitter can send its message to its
receiver at rate D(Z)/2, since two channel uses are needed
per message. This corresponds to DOF = 1/2.

Theorem 3: Consider the n-user ﬁnite ﬁeld interference
network. Fix K and a ∈ A(n, K). We use the scheme JAP(a)
as outlined above. Then
1) the expected time for the kth round to take place is
D ∼ q Tk (a) , where Tk (a) = ak (n − k − 1);
2) the delay exponent for the whole scheme is

IV. N EW ALIGNMENT SCHEMES : JAP AND JAP-B
A. The basic scheme: JAP
Write Hint for the interference vector
j
Hint := (Hj1 , . . . , Hj j−1 , Hj j+1 , . . . , Hjn ).
j
The NGJV scheme has a long delay as after seeing the matrix H[t0 ], we have to wait for a single matrix H[t1 ] = I−H[t0 ]
to appear to simultaneously complete the linear dependences
Hjj [t0 ] + Hjj [t0 ] = 1,

T (a) := max Tk (a) = max ak (n − k − 1).
k

Proof: For 1), we need to analyse the probability the next
matrix satisﬁes (3) and (4). Since there is only a roughly 1/q
chance that (3) is 0, the probability is dominated by (4). The
ﬁrst k interference vectors span a subspace of size about q k ,
where the entire space is of size about q n−1 , so the probability
of (4) is about q −(n−k−1) . Since this must occur for ak users
in step k, the probability is q −ak (n−k−1) to ﬁrst order terms,
and the result follows. Full details in [8].
For 2), note that for large q, the delay is dominated by the
slowest step of the scheme.

Hint [t0 ] + Hint [t1 ] = 0 for all j.
j
j

We can widen the range of acceptable matrices – and so
reduce the expected delay – by
• Building the dependences with more than two matrices;
• Forming any linear combination rather than just a sum;
• Allowing transmitters to complete their dependences at
different times, rather than simultaneously;
• Recovering a multiple of the desired message, rather than
the message itself.
In other words, if there exist scalars λ, λ1 , . . . , λK such that
λ0 Hjj [t0 ] + λ1 Hjj [t1 ] + · · · + λK Hjj [tK ] = λ = 0

B. Improving delay with beamforming: JAP-B
Beamforming slightly improves the performance of JAP(a)
schemes, combining ideas from the original Cadambe–Jafar
interference alignment [1] with the JAP scheme.
In round k we can guarantee that the interference
matches up for receiver l := Ak−1 + 1. Each transmitter
i, instead of repeating their message wi , rather encodes
(Hli [tk ])−1 Hli [t0 ]wi . (Since the coefﬁcient Hli cannot be 0,
the inverse term certainly exists.) The total received interferences at receiver l at times t0 and tk are both equal to
i=l Hli [t0 ]wi , so can be cancelled.
We refer to such schemes that take advantage of beamforming as JAP-B(a) schemes.
Theorem 4: The delay exponent of a JAP-B(a) scheme with
parameter sequence a is

The time delay for user j is tK − t0 , and they have
communcated at rate D(Z)/(K + 1) for DOF = 1/(K + 1).
Start by ﬁxing K ≤ n and a sequence a = (a1 , a2 , . . . , aK )
of length K and weight n, so in the set

k=1

Proof: At each round, receiver Ak−1 + 1 will automatically recover its message, leaving the JAP scheme to align
interference for the other ak − 1 users.
In particular, the JAP-B scheme will always outperform the
JAP scheme with the same sequence a.

and write Ak for the partial sums Ak := a1 + · · · + ak . Then
we deﬁne the scheme JAP(a) as consisting of the following
K + 1 steps:
• Step 0: Start with a matrix H[t0 ].
• Step 1: Set t1 to be the ﬁrst time slot that allows the ﬁrst
a1 receivers 1, 2, . . . , A1 to recover their message from
H[t0 ], H[t1 ].
• Step k: Set tk to be the ﬁrst time slot that allows the
next ak receivers Ak−1 + 1, Ak−1 + 2, . . . , Ak to recover
their message from H[t0 ], H[t1 ], . . . , H[tk ].
• Step K: Set tK to be the ﬁrst time slot that allows the ﬁnal
aK receivers AK−1 + 1, AK−1 + 2, . . . , AK to recover
their message from H[t0 ], H[t1 ], . . . , H[tK ].
By the end of this process, all n = AK receivers have
recovered their message.
Since the message was split over K + 1 time slots, the
common rate of communication is D(Z)/(K + 1), which
corresponds to DOF = 1/(K + 1).
We now examine the delay exponent for our new schemes.

C. An interesting special case: JAP-B(n)
An interesting special case of the JAP-B schemes is the case
when K = 1 and a1 = n; we call this scheme JAP-B(n).
In this case, we have 1/(K + 1) = 1/2 degrees of freedom
for a rate of D(Z)/2. From Theorem 4, we see that the delay
exponent is
TB (n) = (a1 − 1)(n − 1 − 1) = (n − 1)(n − 2).
Effectively, the JAP-B(n) scheme works by using beamforming to automatically cancel user 1’s interference, then for
users 2, 3, . . . , n requiring the existence of diagonal matrices
D0 , D1 such that D0 H[t0 ] + D1 H[t1 ] = I.
Note that this is the same rate as is achieved by the original
NGJV scheme, but the delay exponent has been reduced from

in particular this is a worthwhile improvement (see Figure 1).
For n = 3 users, where experiments have shown the feasibility
of interference alignment [10], the delay exponent is reduced
from n2 = 9 to (n − 1)(n − 2) = 2.

B. Few users: Small n
For small values of n, we can ﬁnd the best parent JAPB schemes by hand. (The task is simpliﬁed by noting that
the optimal ak will be nonzero and increasing in k.) Table
I gives the delay exponents of the best JAP-B schemes for
n = 3, . . . , 7 and K ≤ n − 2.
We also consider child schemes based on parent JAP-B
schemes. Figure 1 plots the performance of NGJV and all
JAP-B schemes, as well as child schemes derived from them,
for n = 3, . . . , 7. For many values of n and DOF, the scheme
with the lowest delay exponent is JAP-B(n) or a child scheme
derived from it, although the JAP-B parent schemes with
(n, K) = (5, 2) or (8, 2), for example, and their child schemes
always outperform JAP(n) for some degrees of freedom.
The table and ﬁgure are extended to n = 8 users in [8].
C. Many users: n → ∞
We now consider the performance of schemes in the manyuser limit n → ∞. We consider two limiting regimes,
depending on how the degrees of freedom DOF(n) should scale
with the number of users n.
• Regime I, where we hold DOF(n) = α constant, for
α ∈ (0, 1/2]. That is, we want to communicate at ﬁxed
fraction of the single-user rate, as in the NGJV scheme.
NGJV itself corresponds to α = 1/2.
• Regime II, where we hold the sum-rate constant, so
the DOF(n) = β/n, for β ≥ 1. That is, we want to
communicate at a multiple of the rate allowed by resource
division schemes like TDMA. TDMA itself corresponds
to β = 1.
First, we consider parent JAP-B(a) schemes.
Theorem 6: Let T (n) be the delay exponent of the best
parent JAP-B(a) scheme for n-users with at least DOF(n)
degrees of freedom. Then:
• Regime I: Fix α ∈ (0, 1/2]. Then the delay exponent for
DOF(n) = α scales quadratically, in that

A. General case
Given a number of users n and a desired number of degrees
of freedom DOF = 1/(K + 1), we wish to ﬁnd a scheme with
the lowest delay exponent.
For K = n − 1 or n, when DOF = 1/n or 1/(n + 1), the
best JAP-B schemes have delay exponent 0. This is the same
delay exponent as TDMA, which has DOF = 1/n also.
For K ≤ n − 2 the best parent scheme will be a JAPB scheme with parameter sequence a ∈ A(n, K). We write
T (n, K) for this best delay exponent, that is

D. Using time-sharing: child schemes
Another way to generate new alignment schemes is by timesharing schemes designed for a smaller number of users.
Call the NGJV, KWG, JAP and JAP-B schemes ‘parent
schemes’. Given a parent scheme for an m-user network,
we can modify the scheme for use in an n-user network for
n > m, giving what we call a ‘child scheme’.
n
We use TDMA to split an n-user network into m subnetworks, each of which contains a unique collection of just
m < n of the users. Within each of these m-user subnetworks,
an m-user parent scheme is used, while the other n − m
transmitters remain silent.
An m-user child scheme has the same delay exponent as
the n-user parent scheme, with the rate, and thus the degrees
of freedom, reduced by a factor of m/n. So an m-user JAP-B
scheme shared between n users gives DOF = m/n(K + 1).
In particular, a child scheme from parent NGJV schemes
has a lower delay exponent m2 < n2 than the main NGJV
scheme, reducing the degrees of freedom from 1/2 to m/2n.
As even this outperforms the KWG schemes, we regard this
as the benchmark against which to compare our new JAP-B
parent and child schemes.
Child schemes derived from the JAP-B(n) parent scheme
are particularly effective, and usually perform better than other
JAP-B schemes, as we discuss in the next section.

Regime II: Fix β > 1. Then the delay exponent for
DOF(n) = β/n is constant, in that
T (n) = ( 2β − 1)( 2β − 2).

Proof: The result follows taking m = 2αn in regime
I, or m = 2β in regime II. Full details in [8].
Note that asymptotically this means that in both regimes
child schemes from JAP-B(m) parent schemes are asymptotically more effective than any other parent scheme.
Note also that by the same argument as above, sharing the
NGJV parent scheme gives T (n) = 4α2 n2 in regime I – less
good than sharing JAP-B(m), but the same to ﬁrst-order terms.
