Abstract—Consider a wireless network of transmitter-receiver
pairs. The transmitters adjust their powers to maintain a
particular SINR target at the corresponding receiver in the
presence of interference from neighboring transmitters. In this
paper we analyze the optimal power vector that achieves this
target in the presence of randomness in the network. Speciﬁcally,
starting from a regular lattice of transmitter-receiver pairs we
randomly turn off a ﬁnite fraction of them. We apply random
matrix theory to evaluate the asymptotic optimal power per
link, as well as the variance of powers in the optimal power
vector in the limit of a large number of links. Our analytical
results show remarkable agreement with numerically generated
networks, both in one- and two-dimensional network geometries.
Interestingly, we observe that unlike regular lattices, the optimal
power in random networks has a discontinuity at a ﬁnite value,
while the variance of its powers diverges at that value. Beyond
that critical point, no feasible power solution exists. We discuss
the relevance of these results in realistic networks.

However, the interference from neighboring transmitters is
only taken into account by considering them as an effective
medium without any feedback taken into account. Hence, the
effects of the increase of power in a given link to other
neighboring links, which also control their power in order to
maintain a target SINR, are neglected. A similar approach is
taken by [8] who introduce a scheme to compensate partially
for the fading coefﬁcient of the direct link between transmitter
and receiver, without addressing the effects on neighboring
links. These effects were partially included in the context
of percolating networks in [9]. Here however, the network
is initially assumed to be percolating with all transmitters
utilizing their maximum power and then the powers are
reduced while keeping their connectivity. Thus the optimal
power is obtained only for the links that are already connected
without any guarantees to others.
The effect of interference is already a problem in dense
WiFi networks and is expected to become an issue in the
context of femto-cells, a recently proposed network paradigm,
when they become massively deployed: due to their close
proximity, neighboring femto-cells may create interference to
one another [10]. Hence, when each transmitter increases its
power in order to compensate for this interference, it may
create domino effect of power increases, which needs to be
addressed. As a result, all above situations are expected to
beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from power optimization. Nevertheless,
little progress has been made in ﬁnding analytic estimates
of the performance of random, interference-limited networks
when power control is applied [11].
In this paper we apply tools from random matrix theory,
[12], [13] providing an analytic estimate of the optimal power
performance for a large network in the presence of both interference and randomness. We start from an ordered network
structure, in particular an equally spaced line (or square) of N
transmitters, each with a receiver located in its neighborhood at
a ﬁxed distance. Then we introduce randomness in the network
by removing each transmitter-receiver pair with probability
e. As a result, a network with roughly N (1 − e) transceiver
pairs will remain, randomly located in the original lattice. This
thinned network is a model for a realistic cellular network,
which usually tries to mimic a (usually hexagonal) symmetric
network. It is also a good model for a wireless network
with intermittent activity, such that at any time a fraction
e of the total transmitters are inactive. Although relatively

I. I NTRODUCTION
Transmitted power is an important resource in wireless networks and therefore power control has been crucial since the
development of legacy networks. For example, the introduction
of efﬁcient power control algorithms (both closed loop and
open loop), was one of the main improvements third generation CDMA-based cellular networks brought about. Several
algorithms been developed that provably allow receivers to
obtain e.g. a minimum SINR requirement SINRk ≥ γk
for link k while minimizing the total power or the power
per user, subject to the feasibility of this solution [1], [2].
Importantly, power optimization remains an relevant problem
in emerging and future networks. Ad hoc networks are one
such class of networks, where substantial effort has been made
to analyze their behavior, through metrics such as connectivity
and transport capacity [3]–[6].
A number of works have discussed the feasibility conditions
of the optimal power vector [5], [7] under general assumptions,
without however addressing speciﬁc gains from power control.
In contrast, [6] using the Laplace transform method, has
calculated the effects of fading, pathloss and random erasures
on the interference to a random receiver in both regular and
Poisson random networks. In addition, they analyze the effects
of power-control by inverting the pathloss and/or the fading
coefﬁcient of the direct link of a given transmitter and receiver.

straightforward, this paradigm carries all the traits of a random
network and, as we shall see, behaves qualitatively differently
from ordered networks. Also, surprisingly these results are
valid for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional networks.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we
deﬁne the network model in the absence of any randomness.
In Section III we describe the network with erasures of
transmitter-receiver pairs and calculate the average minimum
power per receiver as well as its variance using results from
random matrix theory. In Section IV we discuss the relevance
of these results in both one- and two-dimensional geometries.
Finally, in Section V we draw some conclusions, while in the
appendix we provide some details of the proofs.

II. M ODEL D ESCRIPTION
Assume a network of N transmitters on a lattice. The lattice
may be one-dimensional with equal spacing between them,
or two-dimensional (see Fig. 1). In the latter case, which is
obviously the more realistic one, it may have any symmetry,
e.g. hexagonal or triangular, but for concreteness, we will
assume that the lattice is square. Each transmitter is connected
via a link to a single receiver located at a distance δ from
its corresponding transmitter. The channel coefﬁcient between
transmitter i and receiver j and averaged over the fading is
given by
δα
gij =
(1)
(|mi − mj |2 2 + δ 2 )α/2

Fig. 1. Schematic ﬁgure of wireless network. The circles correspond to
transmitters, while the squares receiver users. The opaque squares represent
transmitter-receiver pairs that have been “erased” and are thus considered
inactive.

The receivers now connect with their own nearby cells. The
SINR for each connection is given by
pk gkk
SINRk =
(3)
n + j=k gjk pj
where pk is the transmitted power from the k transmitter to
the receiver k and n is the thermal noise, assumed equal for all
for simplicity. For the connection to be possible, a minimum
value of the SINR has to be attainable i.e.

where mi is the lattice vector of integers corresponding to
transmitter i. For simplicity, we have normalized the channel
gains to unity for i = j. It is also convenient to deﬁne s = δ/ .
For d-dimensional lattices (d = 1, 2), mi can be expressed in
terms of integer linear combinations of the d basis-vectors k
of the lattice

SINRk ≥ γ

Therefore, each transmitter should adjust its own power to
meet this criterion. As a result, the following set of equations
should be simultaneously met

for integer 0 ≤ mia < L, where N = Ld . Since the integers
mia fully specify the position mi , we will drop the index
i when not necessary. For simplicity we assume periodic
boundary conditions on the lattice, hence ma ≡ ma + L. This
means that the distance between any two points is taken as
their minimum distance on a toroidal geometry (or a circular
geometry for one dimension). It should be emphasized that the
effects of this circulant property for the matrix with elements
gij will become negligible for large N . Also, α ≥ 2 is
the pathloss exponent, which signiﬁes how fast the channel
strength decays as a function of distance.
The pathloss function above is somewhat artiﬁcial in its dependence on the distances between the receiver and transmitter. Technically, it is strictly correct only when each receiver is
located vertically to the line connecting all transmitters (as in
any horizontal line of Fig. 1), which is one possible geometry
for one dimensional systems [7]. Nevertheless, it has the right

The above equations constitute a set of linear (planar) constraints on the powers. The minimum total power is reached
at the apex of the conical section of allowed powers, given by
equality of all constraints above. Deﬁning the matrix M with
elements Mij as

we may write the above equation as
P = M−1 J

where P is the vector of powers that satisﬁes the equality
constraint above and J = [1, 1, . . . , 1]T . As a result, the

where we have erased the corresponding entries from J on the
left-hand-side by multiplying with E. Now, simply inverting
the matrix Me is problematic, since it has approximately N e
zero columns and rows and corresponding zero eigenvalues.
Instead, we regularize the matrix by adding a small positive
constant on the diagonal, namely

Clearly, for pave to be well-deﬁned, all the eigenvalues of M
have to be positive.
Now, due to the circulant structure of M, its eigenvectors
will be Fourier modes indexed by the vector q which resides
in the fundamental cell of the reciprocal lattice of the lattice

with −1/2 < ka ≥ 1/2 [15]. The eigenvalue corresponding
to the vector q is simply the Fourier transform of any line of

of the system. Then when N → +∞ the average power per

Remark 1.1. In the appendix the above theorem is proved
for one-dimensional lattices. We will conjecture that this is
valid for two-dimensional lattices and for all feasible γ through
simulations and defer the complete proof for a longer version
of the work.

The above equations are valid in the absence of erasures
of transmitters. Realistically, erasures may occur in two ways.
First, the transmitter in a particular location may be absent.
Therefore, no mobile is expected to receive any data in that
cell. Second, when the buffer to a particular receiver may be
empty for a period of time. Hence the corresponding transmitter will be silent. In principle, it may still be transmitting
a pilot signal, in which case the required SINR will be much
smaller. For simplicity, we will assume that the connection to
its cell-receiver(s) will be off. As a result, for every transmitterreceiver pair that is “off” we need to set both its column and
row elements to zero. Since this pair is chosen at random, we
need to set each column-row pair to zero with probability e.
This can be done by modifying the matrix to

It is easy to see that the above result reduces to pave = 1/λ0
in the limit that e → 0. Indeed, when λ0 > 0, the right-handside of (17) is zero only when β = 0. Similarly, for e → 1
the average power takes its non-interference value
pave = γn

(19)

In the presence of erasures, the maximum SINR target that
is supported in the system is reduced to
γe =

γ
1 + nβe γ

(20)

where βe is the solution of (17) and γ is given by the equality
of (11).
In addition to the mean power, we can also obtain the
variance of the powers in the network given by

It is important to note that these eigenvalues are real because
the matrix M is real and symmetric, which is the reason for
choosing (1). Finally, since the vector J is proportional to the
q = 0 eigenvector of M we conclude that pave = λ−1 where

λ0 = λ(q = 0). This solution corresponds to all transmitters

We start by analyzing the results for the simpler onedimensional case, where the transmitters are located in a ring.
The numerical results are plotted in Fig. 2. There we see,
both analytically and numerically, that the average power is
ﬁnite for a range of γ above the value for which λ0 = 0,
which is the value of γ for which the e = 0 solution diverges.
Interestingly, when γ is such that λ0 < 0 a second solution to
the ﬁxed point equation appears (plotted, for the case of α = 4
in Fig. 2 as dashed line for e = 0.7)). This second solution of
pave is an artifact of the solution and persists until it merges
with the physical value at a critical value of γ. At that point
the variance of the average power vector diverges (see dotted
line in 2). Beyond this point no ﬁnite average power can be
supported for the given value of e. We thus see a discontinuous
transition at that point, from a ﬁnite average minimum power
to an inﬁnite (infeasible) value. This, combined with the fact
the variance of the power vector diverges at this point, suggests
that either a ﬁnite number of transmitter powers diverge, or that
there is a heavy tail in the distribution of transmitter powers
in the optimal power vector.

inﬁnite varies somewhat from sample to sample (as well as
the whole curve beyond the value where λ0 = 0). As we shall
show in the appendix, the end point of this curve has to do
with the largest eigenvalue of the matrix EME. For ﬁnite
but large N it is known for similar random matrix systems
[16] that although the eigenvalues of the matrix converge fast
to their asymptotic spectrum, the largest eigenvalue ﬂuctuates
much more outside the support of the asymptotic spectrum.
Hence, while the theoretical curve seems to be the upper
limit, beyond which no ﬁnite power can be supported, this
ﬁnite size behavior, which can be seen in the numerically
obtained curves in Fig. 2 seems to be due to the ﬂuctuations
of the largest eigenvalue. How can we explain this behavior?
Presumably, if a region happens to have a large concentration
of transmitters it may create a situation where the power of a
particular transmitter diverges.
It is remarkable that these results also hold for twodimensional lattices, even though we have not provided a proof
in this short paper version. This can be seen in Fig. 3. We once
again observe the same behavior as in the one-dimensional
case.

remained feasible the longest possible. The dashed and dotted lines correspond
to the unphysical solution of (17) and the variance of the power feasible vector
in (22) for e = 0.7, respectively. The path-loss exponent is set to α = 4,

In this paper we have studied the optimal power vector
that achieves an SINR target criterion in a wireless network
setting where both randomness and interference are relevant.
We have applied methods from Random Matrix Theory to
obtain the average optimum power and its variance. Our
numerical results show remarkable agreement with predicted

In [13] it is shown that the above quantity takes (a.s.) a
deterministic value in the large N limit, which is the solution
of the following equation

Taking the limit → 0+ in the above and setting β(0) = β
concludes the proof.
Proof of Theorem 2: We start by noting that the normalized second moment of the power vector P is given by

where β ( ), the derivative of β( ) with respect to can be
evaluated directly from (26). Subtracting off p2 concludes

the proof.
It is interesting to point out that the condition that the
denominator in (22) vanishes, which signiﬁes the end of the
feasibility of a solution, is equivalent to the largest edge of the
asymptotic spectrum of the matrix EME becoming zero and
hence the point when β can no longer admit a real solution.
To show this we start from the fact that Λ and FEF† are
