is highly scalable. Now, a signiﬁcant crosstalk between the
optical paths raises the need for MIMO signal processing
techniques. Unfortunately, for large size MIMO (large m) this
is currently unfeasible in the optical rates. Assuming that faster
computation will be available in the future and having in mind
that replacing optical ﬁbers to support SDM is a long and
expensive procedure, a long term design is sought after. To
that end and more, it was proposed to design an optical system
that can support relatively large number of paths for future use,
but at start to address only some of the paths. In this scenario
the channel can be modeled as a sub-matrix of a larger unitary
matrix, i.e., the Jacobi MIMO model is applicable.
This under-addressed channel is discussed in [7] where
simulations of the capacities and outage probabilities were
presented. In this paper we further analyze the channel in
the ergodic and non-ergodic setting, where we provide analytical expression for the capacity, outage probability and
the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. It should be noted that in
optical systems the outage probability is an important measure,
required to be very low. Evidently, since the entire channel
matrix is unitary, when all paths are addressed a zero outage
probability can be attained for any transmission rate. An
interesting result that comes out of this work is that there
are situations where a partial number of pathes are addressed,
yet a number of streams are guaranteed to experience zero
outage. Thus, choosing the number of addressed paths and
the corresponding rate is a very critical design element that
highly reﬂects on the system outage and performance.
While the motivation for this work comes from optical ﬁber
communication, it should be noted that in other cases, such as
in-line communication and even wireless communication, this
model and the insights that follow from it can be relevant as
well. For example, in wireless communication, it is plausible to
imagine that if there were enough receive antennas capturing
most, if not all, transmitted energy, the unitary assumption
can be justiﬁed, and so with the smaller number of antennas
the channel can be modeled as a sub-matrix of a large
unitary matrix. Indeed, as will be shown, when m is large in
comparison to mt , mr , the Jacobi model (up to a normalizing
constant) approaches the Rayleigh model.
The paper is organized as follows. We start by deﬁning
the system model and presenting the channel statistics in
Section II. An interesting transition threshold is revealed:
when the number of addressed paths is large enough, so
that k = mt + mr − m > 0, the statistics of the problem

Abstract—In the Jacobi MIMO channel the transfer matrix
H which couples the mt inputs into mr outputs is a sub-matrix
of an m × m random (Haar-distributed) unitary matrix. The
(squared) singular values of H follow the law of the classical
Jacobi ensemble of random matrices; hence the name of the
channel. A motivation to deﬁne such a channel comes from
multimode/multicore optical ﬁber communication. It turns out
that this model is qualitatively different than the Rayleigh model,
leading to interesting practical and theoretical results. This work
ﬁrst evaluates the ergodic capacity of the channel. In the nonergodic case, it analyzes the outage probability and the diversitymultiplexing tradeoff. In the case where k = mt + mr − m > 0
at least k degrees of freedom are guaranteed not to fade for any
channel realization enabling a zero outage probability or inﬁnite
diversity order at the corresponding rates. Finally, we note that
the Jacobi channel may provide a new fading model to other
applications.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) channels a vector x of
mt signals is transmitted, a vector y of mr signals is received,
and an mr × mt random matrix H represents the coupling of
the input into the output so that the received vector is y =
Hx + z where z is a noise vector. In this paper we consider a
channel matrix H which is a sub-matrix of a Haar-distributed
unitary matrix, i.e., drawn uniformly from the ensemble of all
m × m unitary matrices, m ≥ mt , mr .
The three well-studied, classical random matrix ensembles are the Gaussian, Wishart and Jacobi (also known as
MANOVA) ensembles [1], [2]. In fading wireless communication, the commonly used Rayleigh model assumes that the
channel matrix H comes from the Gaussian ensemble [3]–
[5]. In that case, H † H comes from the Wishart ensemble. For
the model assumed in this paper, H † H follows the Jacobi
ensemble. It turns out that this model is both practically
useful and it is qualitatively different than the Rayleigh model,
leading to interesting theoretical results.
An important motivation to introduce such channels comes
from recent developments in optical ﬁber communication. The
expected capacity crunch in long haul optical ﬁbers [6] led to
proposals for “space-division multiplexing” (SDM) [7], that
is to have several links at the same ﬁber, by either multiple single-mode ﬁber strands within a ﬁber cable, multiple
cores within a multi-core ﬁber, or multiple modes within
a multi-mode waveguide. An SDM system with m parallel
transmission paths per wavelength can potentially multiply
the throughput of a certain link by a factor of m. Since
m can potentially be chosen very large, SDM technology

changes. Using this observation we give analytic expressions
for the ergodic capacity in Section III. In Section IV we
analyze the outage probabilities in the non-ergodic channel
and show that for k > 0 a strictly zero outage probability
is obtainable for k degrees of freedom. Section V discusses
the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the channel where we
show an absorbing difference in the maximum diversity gain
between the Rayleigh fading and Jacobi channels. Section VI
summarizes and discusses the results.
Due to space limitation, all proofs are omitted. We refer the
reader to [8] for further detail.

Deﬁnition 3 (Jacobi ensemble). J (m1 , m2 , n), where
m1 , m2 ≥ n, is n × n Hermitian matrix which can be
constructed as A(A + B)−1 , where A and B are W(m1 , n)
and W(m2 , n), respectively.
The ﬁrst two ensembles relate to wireless communication
[5]. We claim here that the third classical ensemble, the Jacobi
ensemble, is relevant to this channel model by relating its
eigenvalues to the singular values of H11 . To that end we quote
the well-known [1] joint probability density function (PDF) of
the ordered eigenvalues 0 ≤ λ1 ≤ . . . ≤ λn ≤ 1 of the Jacobi
ensemble J (m1 , m2 , n)

II. S YSTEM M ODEL AND C HANNEL S TATISTICS
We consider a space-division multiplexing system that supports m spatial orthogonal propagation modes. Assuming a
unitary coupling among all transmission modes the overall
transfer matrix H can be described as an m × m unitary
matrix, where each entry hij represents the complex path
gain from transmitted mode i to received mode j. We further
assume a uniformly distributed unitary coupling, i.e., H is
drawn uniformly from the ensemble of all m × m unitary
matrices (Haar distributed). Considering a communication
system where mt ≤ m and mr ≤ m modes are being
addressed by the transmitter and receiver, respectively, the
effective transfer matrix is a truncated version of H. Under
these conditions the channel can be described as

where Km1 ,m2 ,n is a normalizing constant. We say that n
variables follow the law of the Jacobi ensemble J (m1 , m2 , n)
if their joint PDF follows (3).
We shall now present the explicit distribution of the channel’s singular values by distinguishing between the following
two cases:
A. The case of mt + mr ≤ m

In [9] it was shown that for mt , mr satisfying the conditions mt ≤ mr and mt + mr ≤ m, the eigenvalues of
H† H11 have the same distribution as the eigenvalues of the
11
Jacobi ensemble J (mr , m − mr , mt ). For mt , mr satisfying
mt > mr and mt + mr ≤ m, since H† share the same
distribution with H, the eigenvalues of H11 H† follow the law
11
of the Jacobi ensemble J (mt , m − mt , mr ). Thus we can say
that the squared non-zero singular values of H11 share the
same distribution with the eigenvalues of the Jacobi ensemble
J (mmax , m − mmax , mmin ), where and throughout this paper
we denote mmax = max{mt , mr } and mmin = min{mt , mr }..

where the vector x containing mt complex components, represents the transmitted signal, the vector y containing mr
complex components, represents the received signal, and z
accounts for the presence of additive Gaussian noise. The
mr components of z are statistically independent, circularly
symmetric complex zero-mean Gaussian variables of unit
energy E(|zj |2 ) = 1. The components of x are constrained
such that the average energy of each component is equal to 1,
i.e., E(|xj |2 ) = 1 for all j 1 . The term ρ ≥ 0 is proportional
to the power per excited mode so that it equals to the signalto-noise ratio in the single mode case (m = 1). The matrix
H11 is a block of size mr × mt within the m × m random
unitary matrix H
H=

λm1 −n (1 − λi )m2 −n
i

B. The case of mt + mr > m
The following Lemma provides the joint PDF of the singular
values of H11 for cases in which mt , mr satisfy mt +mr > m.
Lemma 1. Suppose H is an m × m Haar distributed unitary
matrix, divided into blocks as in (2), where H11 is an mr ×mt
block with mt + mr > m. Then mt + mr − m eigenvalues
of H† H11 are 1, mt − mmin are 0 and m − mmax equal the
11
non-zeros eigenvalues of H† H22 , thereby follow the law of
22
the Jacobi ensemble J (m − mmin , mmin , m − mmax ).

(2)

As a ﬁrst stage in our analysis we establish the relation
between the transfer matrix H11 and the Jacobi ensemble of
random matrices [1], [2]. Limiting our discussion to complex
matrices we state the following deﬁnitions:

Deﬁnition 1 (Gaussian ensemble). G(m, n) is m × n matrix
of i.i.d complex entries distributed as CN (0, 1).

In the ergodic scenario the transmitted signal is assumed
to sample the entire channel statistics. In this case the mutual
information between the input and output of the channel is
averaged with respect to all channel matrix realizations. Since
we assume that the channel realization at each symbol time
is known only at the receiver end, it can be shown [8] that
an input vector of circularly symmetric zero-mean Gaussian

n × n Hermitian matrix which can be constructed as A† A,

power constraint often used in wireless communication, is motivated by the
optical ﬁber nonlinearity limitation.

Note that C(m − mr , m − mt , m; ρ) is given by Theorem 1
and that the second term on the right-hand-side of (7) reduces
to 0 when mt , or mr is equal to m. The form of Eq. (7)
follows from the fact that k = mt + mr − m of the singular
values are equal to unity, while the remaining singular values
correspond to the Jacobi ensemble; hence the ergodic capacity
is always at least k log(1+ρ). In Fig. 1 we present the ergodic
capacity as a function of ρ for m = 4.

components with covariance matrix Imt maximizes the mutual
information; thereby the ergodic capacity is
C(mt , mr , m; ρ) = E[log det(Imt + ρH† H11 )] ,
11

In the non-ergodic scenario the channel matrix is drawn
randomly but rather assumed to be constant within the entire
transmission period of each code-frame. The ﬁgure of merit
in the non-ergodic case is the outage probability deﬁned as
the probability that the mutual information induced by the
channel realization is lower than the rate R at which the link
is chosen to operate. Note that we assume that the channel
instantiation is unknown to the transmitter, thus it can not
adapt the transmission rate. However, the channel is assumed
to be known at the receiver. By taking an input vector of
circularly symmetric complex zero-mean Gaussian variables
with covariance matrix Q the mutual information is maximized
and the outage probability can be expressed as

where Imt is the identity mt × mt matrix.
A. The case of mt + mr ≤ m
The following theorem gives an analytical expression to
the ergodic capacity for the case where mt + mr ≤ m.
Using the joint PDF of the eigenvalues of the Jacobi ensemble
J (mmax , m − mmax , mmin ) we associate the channel capacity
with the Jacobi polynomials [10, 8.96].

where the minimization is over all covariance matrices Q
satisfying the power constraint. The optimal choice of Q may
depend on R and ρ and in general is unknown, even for the
Rayleigh fading channel. Nevertheless, it can be shown that
when ρ ≫ 1, the identity matrix Imt is approximately the
optimal Q. In the following we make the simpliﬁed assumption
that the transmitted covariance matrix is the commonly used
choice Q = Imt . We denote the outage probability in this case
by Pout (mt , mr , m; R).

Using multiple modes/antennas is an important mean to
improve performance in optical/wireless systems. The performance can be improved by increasing the transmission rate
or by reducing the error probability. A coding scheme can
achieve both performance gains, however there is a fundamental tradeoff between how much each can get. This tradeoff
is known as the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The
optimal tradeoff for the Rayleigh fading channel was found in
[11]. In this section we seek to ﬁnd the optimal tradeoff for
the Jacobi channel.
We start by formalizing the concepts of diversity gain and
multiplexing gain. To that end we quote some deﬁnitions from
[11] 2 .

Theorem 4. Suppose l ≥ mt +mr −1. The optimal DMT curve
d∗ (r) for the channel deﬁned in (1), with mt , mr satisfying
mt + mr ≤ m, is given by the piecewise linear function that
connects the points (k, d∗ (k)) for k = 0, 1, · · · , mmin , where

We refer the reader to [8] for further discussion about the
optimal DMT curve for l < mt + mr − 1.
Theorem 4 suggests that for mt + mr ≤ m, the optimal
DMT curve does not depend on m. Note that m relates to the
extent in which the elements of H11 are mutually independent
– the dependency is smaller as m is larger. Thus, at high SNR
(ρ ≫ 1) and for mt + mr ≤ m, the impact of the correlation
between the path gains on the error probability is negligible
and the decaying order of the error probability behaves as in
the Rayleigh channel (where the path gains are independent).

Note that the right-hand-side drops to 0, when mr , or
mt equals m. Most importantly, when r < mt + mr − m,
r = 0, implying that for such rates zero outage probability

is achievable. A practical scheme for achieving zero outage
under these conditions is proposed and discussed in [8]. In
addition, when r ≥ mt + mr − m > 0, Eq. (12) implies
that the outage probability is identical to that of a channel
with m − mr modes addressed by the transmitter and m − mt
modes addressed by the receiver, which is designed to support
a transmission rate equivalent to r single-mode channels. Thus

the right-hand-side of (12) applies to Eq. (11). In Fig. 2 we

as the number of orthogonal propagation paths in space,
whereas mt and mr are the number of addressed paths at the
transmitter and receiver, respectively. For ﬁxed mt , mr , the
parameter m may be deﬁned as the “independence measure”
of the channel. For example, when mt = mr = m the
transfer matrix H11 is unitary, all propagations paths are
orthogonal and H11 ’s elements are highly dependent. As m
is larger, the orthogonality of the columns and rows of H11
fades and the dependency between the path gains becomes
weaker. Indeed, in [8] we show that as m increases, the Jacobi
channel approaches to a Rayleigh channel in terms of the
singular values statistics. Thus, the Jacobi model introduces
new concepts in MIMO channel modeling, providing a degree
of freedom to scale the MIMO model from a unitary channel
up to a Rayleigh channel.

According to Theorem 3 a zero outage probability is achievable for rates below (mt + mr − m) log(1 + ρ). Hence, for
any (mt + mr − m) > δ > 0 there is a scheme C(ρ)
where the rate of each code is (mt + mr − m − δ) log(1 + ρ)
that achieve zero outage probability, thereby an exponentially
decaying error probability. In this case the discussion about
diversity is no longer of relevance. Nonetheless, one can think
of the gain as inﬁnite. This reveals an interesting difference
between the Jacobi and Rayleigh channels - the maximum
diversity gain is “unbounded” as opposed to mr mt in the later
case.

VI. D ISCUSSION
The Jacobi MIMO channel is deﬁned by the transfer matrix
H11 , a truncated mr × mt portion of an m × m Haar
distributed unitary matrix. By establishing the relation between
the channel’s singular values and the Jacobi ensemble of
random matrices we derived the ergodic capacity, outage
probability and optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. An
interesting phenomenon is observed when mt + mr > m: for
any realization of H11 , mt +mr −m singular values are 1. This
results in an ergodic capacity which is at least mt + mr − m
times the SISO capacity. In the non-ergodic scenario this
results a promise for strictly zero outage probability and an
exponentially decaying error probability (“inﬁnite diversity”)
for any transmission rate below (mt + mr − m) log(1 + ρ).
The results here provide conceptual insights on MIMO
channels. The size of the unitary matrix, m, can be viewed
