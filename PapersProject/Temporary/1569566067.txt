when the channel inputs are coded within a vanishing set
of rates around the critical rate. Similar considerations were
made in [2], specialized in [7] to the AWGN fading channel. Further work on the asymptotic blocklength regime via
information spectrum methods comprise the general capacity
formula derived in [8] based on a lower bound on the error
probability provided in [9]. Alternatively, in [10], Shannon
derived bounds on the limit of the scaled logarithm of the
error probability, known as the exponential rate of decrease.
Simpler formulas for the latter were then provided by Gallager
[11] which are still difﬁcult to evaluate for practical channel
models. To circumvent this issue, a Gaussian approximation
of Gallager’s bound with higher-order correction terms was
recently obtained in [12] for the Rayleigh fast-fading MIMO
channel. In [13], an explicit expression of Gallager’s error
exponent was derived for the block-fading MIMO channel.
However, the computation of this result is quite involved.
The objective of this article is to investigate an inputconstrained version of Feinstein’s bound on the error probability [7] as well as Hayashi’s optimal average error probability
for the Gaussian MIMO Rayleigh fading channel in the nonergodic regime. Although exact expressions of the optimal
error probability are extremely difﬁcult to obtain in this setting,
we derive a tight approximation of an upper bound on the error
probability, which depends on the blocklength n, the number
of transmit and receive antennas K and N , respectively, and
the coding rate rn,K . More precisely, using recent results from
random matrix theory, we show that, given a probability of
error 0 ≤ < 1, and for n, K, and N sufﬁciently large, rates
rn,K of the following form

Abstract—This paper provides a novel central limit theorem
(CLT) for the information density of the MIMO Rayleigh fading
channel under white Gaussian inputs, when the data blocklength
n and the number of transmit and receive antennas K and
N , respectively, are large but of similar order of magnitude.
This CLT is used to derive closed-form upper bounds on the
error probability via an input-constrained version of Feinstein’s
lemma by Polyanskiy et al. and the second-order approximation
of the coding rate. Numerical evaluations suggest that the normal
approximation is tight for reasonably small values of n, K, N .

I. I NTRODUCTION
The conventional notion of capacity focuses on the asymptotic limit of the tradeoff between accuracy and coding rate.
When one considers the regime of ﬁnite-length codewords,
only few results on this tradeoff are known whose exact
evaluation is usually intractable. Thus, practical expressions
of fundamental communication limits are mostly given by
asymptotic approximations based on the large blocklength
regime [1], [2]. Similarly, when multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems are considered, one often relies on large
system approximations where the number of transmit and
receive antennas are assumed to grow without bounds [3].
For both scenarios, it is well known that these asymptotic
approximations mimic closely the system performance in the
non-asymptotic regimes. Motivated by this observation, we
provide in this paper an asymptotic approximation of the
error performance of MIMO channels in the ﬁnite blocklength
regime, based on large random matrix theory.
One of the fundamental quantities of interest when exploring the tradeoff between achievable rate and block error
probability is the information density (or the information
spectrum). This quantity was used by Feinstein in [4] to derive
an upper bound on the block error probability for a given
coding rate in the ﬁnite blocklength regime. Since this bound
is in general not amenable to simple evaluation, asymptotic
considerations were made, in particular by Strassen [1] who
derived a general expression for the discrete memoryless
channel with unconstrained inputs. In his work, the variance of
the information density [5] appears as a fundamental quantity.
Nevertheless, Strassen’s approach could not be generalized to
channels with input constraints, such as the AWGN channel.
To tackle this limitation, Hayashi [6] introduced the notion
of second-order coding rate and provided an exact characterization of the so-called optimal average error probability

This bound is useful to assess the backoff from the ergodic
channel capacity in the ﬁnite blocklength regime and it is
characterized by only a few important system parameters.
Applications arise for example in the context of MIMO
ARQ block-fading channels where one is generally interested
in minimizing the average data delivery delay, rather than
maximizing the transmission rate.

The exact characterization of the optimal error probability
(n)
Pe,N,K (r) for ﬁxed n, K, N and non-trivial channel models
is generally intractable. An upper-bound for the exact optimal
error probability was provided in [2, Thm. 24] as follows.
Theorem 1 ([2, Thm. 24], (see also Feinstein [4])): Let X
be an arbitrary input to the channel dPYH|X with output
Y and channel matrix H. Given an arbitrary positive integer
n
Mn,K , there exists a CK = n, K, Mn,K , ϕ, φ -code with

There have been recent efforts [6], [2] to establish error
probability approximations when the coding rate is within
1
O((nK)− 2 ) of the ergodic capacity. In this scenario, a
“second-order” expression is deﬁned as follows.

The information density will be exploited in this work to
obtain bounds on two different deﬁnitions of error probability.
Deﬁnition 1 (Code and average error probability): An
n, K, Mn,K , ϕ, φ -code for the channel model (3) consists
of the following mappings:

independent inputs xt ∼ CN (0, IK ), this reads

chi-square random variable with k degrees of freedom.
The information density i (X; YH) of the channel
dPYH|X (the joint probability density function (pdf) of
(Y, H) conditioned on X), is deﬁned by [5]
i (X; YH) =

N ×n

which produces the decoder’s decision m = φ(Y, H) on

probability is deﬁned as

A. Channel model and its information density
yt = Hxt + σwt ,

for each (nK)-blocklength where n, K denote the number of channel uses and transmit antennas, respectively.

Remark 3.1: It is interesting to observe the transition from Corollary 1 to the second-order approximation when rn,K is close to the ergodic capacity, i.e.,

rn,K = E[CN,K (σ 2 )] + √nK . In this case, one can show

that nKδn,K → 0 while nKδn,k → ∞. Moreover, as
2
n, K → ∞, χ2nK (2nK(1 + α)) → 1. Hence, the upper(n)
bound on Pe,N,K (rn,K ) can be approximated by (2). Letting
(n)
Pe,N,K (rn,K ) = and applying the inverse Q-function to both
sides of (2) yields the achievable rate (1).

Proof: A sketch of proof is provided in the appendix.
We now apply the CLT to provide a tight approximation of
the upper bound in Theorem 1.

In Fig. 2, we then compare the error bound Pe,N,K (rn,K ) of

We have studied the error probability of quasi-static MIMO
Rayleigh fading channels in the ﬁnite blocklength regime.
Under a large system assumption, we have derived a CLT
for the information density. This result was used to compute
a tight closed-form approximation of Feinstein’s upper bound
on the optimal error probability with input constraints and
an achievable upper bound of the optimal average error
probability in the second-order coding rate. Numerical results
demonstrated that the Gaussian approximation is valid for very
small blocklengths and realistic numbers of antennas. Some
comments on relevant issues and on-going work are in order:
• Converse to Corollary 2: Proving a converse to the optimal average error probability would require the derivation
of a CLT of the information density for general input
distributions. The proof of such a result is also related to
the conjecture of Telatar on the outage-minimizing input
distribution for multi-antenna fading channels, recently
conﬁrmed for the MISO channel in [15].
• Extensions to other scenarios of interest: The blockfading regime as well as tradeoffs between channel training and data transmission can also be addressed within
the framework proposed in this article. Moreover, CLTs
for the information density with linear receive ﬁlters have
been derived in an extended version of this article.
