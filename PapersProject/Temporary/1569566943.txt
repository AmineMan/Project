decoder (the Winer-Ziv problem [22], [23]). We consider these
two problems in their most general settings i.e. when the
source and the channel are arbitrary but memoryless. We use
nested lattice codes with joint typicality decoding/encoding
rather than lattice decoding. We consider a lattice code ensemble with simpler random dithers and without modulo-Λ
transformations as used in [25]. We show that in both settings,
from an information-theoretic point of view, nested lattice
codes are optimal.
The paper is organized as follows: in Section II we present
the required preliminaries and introduce our notation. In Section III we show the optimality of nested lattice codes for channels with state information (the Gelfand-Pinsker problem).
We brieﬂy present the optimality of nested lattice codes for
source coding with side information (the Wyner-Ziv problem)
in Section IV and we conclude in Section V.

Abstract—In this paper, we show that nested lattice codes
achieve the capacity of arbitrary continuous channels with or
without non-causal state information at the transmitter. We also
show that nested lattice codes are optimal for source coding
with or without non-causal side information at the receiver for
arbitrary continuous sources. We show the optimality of lattice
codes for the Gelfand-Pinsker and Wyner-Ziv problems in their
most general settings.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Lattice codes for continuous sources and channels are the
analogue of linear codes for discrete sources and channels and
play an important role in information theory and communications. Linear/lattice and nested linear/lattice codes have been
used in many communication settings to improve upon the
existing random coding bounds [2], [10]–[13], [16], [18], [20].
In [2] and [12] the existence of lattice codes satisfying
Shannon’s bound has been shown. These results have been
generalized and the close relation between linear and lattice
codes has been pointed out in [13]. In [24], several results
regarding lattice quantization noise in high resolution has
been derived and the problem of constructing lattices with
an arbitrary quantization noise distribution has been studied
in [7].
Nested lattice codes were introduced in [26] where the
concept of structured binning is presented. Nested linear/lattice
codes are important because in many communication problems, specially multi-terminal settings, such codes can be
superior in average performance compared to random codes
[11]. It has been shown in [25] that nested lattice codes are
optimal for the Wyner-Ziv problem when the source and side
information are jointly Gaussian. The dual problem of channel
coding with state information has been addressed in [4]–[6],
[21] and the optimality of lattice codes for Gaussian channels
has been shown. In [3], it was shown that random linear
codes provide good binning schemes for general Slepian-Wolf
coding.
In a recent work [17], it has been shown that nested linear
codes are optimal for arbitrary discrete memoryless channels
with state information at the transmitter. In this paper we focus
on two problems: 1) The point to point channel coding with
state information at the encoder (the Gelfand-Pinsker problem
[8]) and 2) Lossy source coding with side information at the

II. P RELIMINARIES
1) Channel Model: We associate two sets X and Y with
the channel as the channel input and output alphabets. The set
of channel states is denoted by S and it is assumed that the
channel state is distributed over S according to PS . When the
state of the channel S is s ∈ S, the input-output relation of the
channel is characterized by a transition kernel WY |XS (y|x, s)
for x ∈ X and y ∈ Y. We assume the state of the channel is
known at the transmitter non-causally. The channel is speciﬁed
by (X , Y, S, PS , WY |XS , w) where w is the cost function.
2) Source Model: The source is modeled as a discretetime random process X with each sample taking values in
a ﬁxed set X called alphabet. Assume X is distributed jointly
with the random variable S according to the measure PXS
over X × S where S is an arbitrary set. We assume that
the side information S is known to the receiver non-causally.
The reconstruction alphabet is denoted by U and the quality
of reconstruction is measured by a single-letter distortion
functions d : X × U → R+ . We denote such sources by
(X , S, U, PXS , d).
3) Linear and Coset Codes Over Zp : For a prime number
k
p, a linear code over Zp of length n and rate R = n log p
k
is a collection of p codewords of length n which is closed
under mod-p addition. Any such code can be characterized
by its generator matrix G ∈ Zk×n . The set of all message
p
tuples for this code is Zk and the set of all codewords is the
p
range of the matrix G. The linear encoder maps a message

The set of messages consists of the set of all bins of Λi in
¯ o . We denote a nested lattice code by a pair (Λi , Λo ).

7) Achievability for Channel Coding: A transmission system with parameters (n, M, Γ, τ ) for reliable communication
over a given channel (X , Y, S, PS , WY |XS ) with cost function
w : X → R+ consists of an encoding mapping and a
decoding mapping e : S n × {1, 2, . . . , M } → X n , f :
Y n → {1, 2, . . . , M } such that for all m = 1, 2, . . . , M ,

tuple u ∈ Zk to the codeword x where x = uG and the
p
operations are done mod-p. A coset code over Zp is a shift
of a linear code by a ﬁxed vector. A coset code of length n
k
and rate R = n log p is characterized by its generator matrix
k×n
G ∈ Zp and it’s shift vector (dither) B ∈ Zn . The encoding
p
rule for the corresponding coset code is given by x = uG+B,
where u is the message tuple and x is the codeword.
4) Lattice Codes and Shifted Lattice Codes: A lattice code
of length n is a collection of codewords in Rn which is closed
under real addition. A shifted lattice code is any translation
of a lattice code by a real vector. In this paper, we use coset
codes to construct (shifted) lattice codes as follows: Given a
coset code C of length n over Zp and a step size γ, deﬁne
Λ(C, γ, p) = γ(C − p−1 ). Then the corresponding mod-p
2
¯
lattice code Λ(C, γ, p) is the disjoint union of shifts of Λ by
¯
(γv + Λ). Note that
vectors in γpZn . i.e. Λ(C, γ, p) =

Ci = aG + B|a ∈ Zl
p

(2)

It is clear that the inner code is contained in the outer code.
Furthermore, the inner code induces a partition of the outer
code through its shifts. For m ∈ Zk deﬁne the mth bin of Ci
p
in Co as Bm = aG + m∆G + B|a ∈ Zl . The outer code
p
is the disjoint union of all the bins and each bin index m ∈ Zk
p
is considered as a message. We denote a nested linear code
by a pair (Ci , Co ).
6) Nested Lattice Codes: Given a nested linear code
(Ci , Co ) over Zp and a step size γ, deﬁne

Λi (Ci , γ, p) = γ(Ci −

Λo (Co , γ, p) = γ(Co −

Then the corresponding nested lattice code consists of an inner
lattice code and an outer lattice code

Λo (Co , γ, p) = ∪v∈pZn (γv + Λo )

Given a channel (X , Y, S, fS , fY |XS ), a pair of non negative
numbers (R, W ) is said to be achievable if for all > 0 and
for all sufﬁciently large n, there exists a transmission system
for reliable communication with parameters (n, M, Γ, τ ) such
1
that n log M ≥ R − , Γ ≤ W + and τ ≤ .
8) Achievability for Source Coding: A transmission system with parameters (n, Θ, ∆, τ ) for compressing a given
source (X , S, U, PXS , d(·)) consists of an encoding mapping
e : X n → {1, 2, · · · , Θ} and a decoding mapping g : S n ×
{1, 2, · · · , Θ} → U n such that P (d(X n , g(e(X n ))) > ∆) ≤
τ where X n is the random vector of length n generated by
the source. In this transmission system, n denotes the block
length, log Θ denotes the number of channel uses, ∆ denotes
the distortion level and τ denotes the probability of exceeding
the distortion level ∆.
Given a source, a pair of non-negative real numbers (R, D)
is said to be achievable if there exists for every > 0, and
for all sufﬁciently large numbers n a transmission system with
parameters (n, Θ, ∆, τ ) for compressing the source such that
1
n log Θ ≤ R + , ∆ ≤ D + and τ ≤ .
9) Mutual Information and Kullback-Leibler divergence:
Let Q = {A1 , A2 , · · · , Ar } be a ﬁnite measurable partition
of Rd . For random variables U and Y on Rd with measure
PU Y deﬁne the quantized random variables UQ and YQ
on Q with measure PUQ YQ (Ai , Aj ) = PU Y (Ai , Aj ). The
Kullback-Leibler divergence between U and Y is deﬁned
as D(U Y ) = supQ D(UQ YQ ) where D(UQ YQ ) is the
discrete Kullback-Leibler divergence and the supremum
is taken over all ﬁnite partitions Q of Rd . Similarly,
the mutual information between U and Y is deﬁned as
I(U ; Y ) = supQ I(UQ ; YQ ) where I(UQ ; YQ ) is the discrete
mutual information between the two random variables and
the supremum is taken over all ﬁnite partitions Q of Rd .

¯
Λ(C, γ, p) ⊆ Λ(C, γ, p) is a scaled and shifted copy of the
linear code C.
5) Nested Linear Codes: A nested linear code consists of
two linear codes, with the property than one of the codes (the
inner linear code) is a subset of the other code (the outer
linear code). For positive integers k and l, let the outer and
inner codes Ci and Co be linear codes over Zp characterized
(k+l)×n
by their generator matrices G ∈ Zl×n and G ∈ Zp
p
and their shift vectors B ∈ Zn and B ∈ Zn respectively.

10) Typicality: We use the notion of weak* typicality with
Prokhorov metric introduced in [14]. Let M (Rd ) be the set of
probability measures on Rd . For a subset A of Rd deﬁne its
-neighborhood by A = {x ∈ Rd |∃y ∈ A such that x −
y < } where · denotes the Euclidean norm in Rd .
The Prokhorov distance between two probability measures
P1 , P2 ∈ M (Rd ) is deﬁned as follows:

In this case as well, the inner lattice code induces a partition of
the outer lattice code. For m ∈ Zk , deﬁne Bm = γ(Bm − p−1 )

where Bm is the mth bin of Ci in Co . The mth bin of the
inner lattice code in the outer lattice code is deﬁned by:

sequence x is weakly* -typical with respect to PX if
π1 (PX , Px ) < . We denote the set of all weakly* -typical
sequences of length n by An (X). Similarly, x and y are
said to be jointly weakly* -typical with respect to PXY if
π2 (Pxy , PXY ) < . We denote the set of all weakly* typical sequence pairs of length n by An (XY ). We deﬁne
An (Y |x) = {y ∈ Y n |(x, y) ∈ An (X, Y ) }.

such that lim →0 O( ) = 0 and for a set G, |G| denotes the
cardinality (size) of G.

In this section we prove the theorem for the case when
ˆ
U = U takes values from the discrete set γ(Zp − p−1 ) where
2
p is a prime and γ is a positive number. We use a random
coding argument over the ensemble of mod-p lattice codes to
prove the achievability. Let Co and Ci be deﬁned as (1) and
(2) where G is a random matrix in Zl×n , ∆G is a random

matrix in Zk×n and B is a random vector in Zn , all uniformly

distributed over their respective domains. Deﬁne Λi (Ci , γ, p)

and Λo (Co , γ, p) accordingly. The ensemble of nested lattice
codes consists of all lattices of the form (3) and (4). The set
of messages consists of all bins Bm indexed by m ∈ Zk . The
p
encoder observes the message m ∈ Zk and the channel state
p
s ∈ S n and looks for a vector u in the mth bin Bm which is
jointly weak* typical with s and encodes the message m to
x according to WX|SU . The encoder declares error if it does
not ﬁnd such a vector.
After receiving y ∈ Y n , the decoder decodes it to m ∈ Zk if
p
m is the unique tuple such that the mth bin Bm contains a
sequence jointly typical with y. Otherwise it declares error.

Proof: This lemma is a generalization of theorem 21 of
[14]. The complete proof can be found in a more complete
version of this work [19].

Let γ0 = 1 and deﬁne γn = 21 . Note that if m > n then
n
Fγn ,∞ is included in Fγm ,∞ . Also, since dyadic intervals
generate the Borel Sigma ﬁeld ( [15] for example), the
restriction of U to the sigma algebra generated by ∪∞ Fγn ,∞
n=1
is U itself. We can use Theorem III.6 to get

Therefore, using Chebyshev’s inequality we obtain

Therefore if n log p > D(PU S PZ PS ) then the probability of

encoding error goes to zero as the block length increases.
2) Decoding Error: The decoder declares error if there is
no bin Bm containing a sequence jointly typical with the channel output y or if there are multiple bins containing sequences
jointly typical with y. Assume that the message m has been
encoded to x according to WX|SU where u = g(a, m) and
the channel state is s. The channel output y is jointly typical
with u with high probability. It can be shown [19] that the
probability of decoding error is upper bounded by

Combining (8) and (9) we conclude that for all > 0, there
exist Γ and P such that if γ ≤ Γ and p ≥ Γ then
I(U |Fγ,p ; Y |Fγ,p ) − I(U ; Y ) <

close to D(PU S PZ PS ) and n log p sufﬁciently close to

D(PU S PZ PS ) we can achieve the rate
ˆ

I(U |Fγ,p ; Y |Fγ,p ) ≤ I(U |Fγ,p ; Y ) ≤ I(U ; Y )
Therefore I(U |Fγ,p ; Y ) − I(U ; Y ) < . Also note that
ˆ
I(U |Fγ,p ; Y ) = I(Uγ,p ; Y ) since we deﬁne the joint measure
to be the same. Therefore

We have shown in Section III-A that for discrete random
variables the region given in Theorem III.1 is achievable. In
this part, we make a quantization argument to generalize this
result to arbitrary auxiliary random variables. Let S, U, X, Y
be distributed according to PS PU |S PX|U S WY |X where in this
case U is an arbitrary random variable. We start with the
following theorem:

(11)

if we take the maximum of the two p’s and the minimum of
the two γ’s, we can say for all > 0 there exist γ and p such
that both (10) and (11) happen.

EPSU X {w(X)} ≤ W since w is assumed to be bounded
continuous.

Hence, using the result of section III-A, we have shown the
achievability of the rate region given in Theorem III.1 for
arbitrary auxiliary random variables when the cost function
is bounded and continuous.

We have shown that nested lattice codes are optimal for the
Gelfand-Pinsker problem as well as the Wyner-Ziv problem.

Since X is bounded and w is assumed to be continuous, w
is also bounded. This completes the proof.
IV. S OURCE C ODING
We show the achievability of the rate R = I(U ; X) −
I(U ; S) for the Wyner-Ziv problem using nested lattice codes.

Theorem IV.1. For the source (X , S, X , PXS , d(·)) assume
ˆ
X , S, X ⊆ R and d(·) is continuous. Let U be a random
variable taking values from the set U jointly distributed with X
and S according to PXS WU |X where WU |X (·|·) is a transition
kernel. Further assume that there exists a measurable function
ˆ
f : S × U → X such that E{d(X, f (S, U ))} ≤ D. Then the
rate R∗ (D) = I(X; U ) − I(S; U ) is achievable using nested
lattice codes.
Here we present a sketch of the proof of this theorem. The
complete proof is similar to the channel coding problem and
is provided in [19]. The ensemble of codes used for source
coding is based on the parity check matrix representation of
linear and lattice codes. For a prime number p, the linear code
over Zp corresponding to the parity check matrix H ∈ Zk×n is
p
the kernel of the matrix H; i.e. C = u ∈ Zn |Hu = 0 where
p
the operations are done mod-p. The coset code corresponding
to the parity check matrix H ∈ Zk×n and the bias vector
p
c ∈ Zk is deﬁned as C = u ∈ Zn |Hu = c .
p
p
Nested linear codes based on the parity check representation
of linear codes can be deﬁned as follows
Co = u ∈ Zn |Hu = c ,
p
Ci = u ∈ Zn |Hu = c, ∆Hu = ∆c
p
where H ∈ Zk×n and ∆H ∈ Zk×n . The ensemble of lattice
p
p
codes are then constructed using (1) and (4). The encoding
and decoding rules are as follows: For m ∈ Zk , Let Bm be
p
the mth bin of Λi in Λo . The encoder observes the source
sequence x ∈ X n and looks for a vector u in the outer code
Λo which is typical with x and encodes the sequence x to the
bin of Λi in Λo containing u. The encoder declares error if it
does not ﬁnd such a vector.
Having observed the index of the bin m and the side information s, the decoder looks for a unique sequence u in the
mth bin which is jointly typical with s and outputs f (u, s).
Otherwise it declares error. Similar to the channel coding
problem, this theorem is ﬁrst proved for discrete auxiliary
random variables and then it is generalized to arbitrary sources.
