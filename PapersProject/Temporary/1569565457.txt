derive an exponential decreasing rate for leaked information,
whose commutative case is the same as that by [13]. Further,
using the Pinsker inequality, we apply our result to the criterion
for the trace norm distance. When the extracted key rate is
larger than the conditional entropy, the leaked information
does not go to zero. In this case, we focus on the minimum
conditional entropy rate. The rate is called the equivocation
rate [3] and the quantum version has not been treated until
now. Then, we derive the equivocation rate as by treating the
minimum leaked information rate.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we prepare
quantum versions of information quantities. In Section III,
we derive the exponents of leaked information when the key
generation rate is less than the conditional entropy rate. In
Section IV, we derive the equivocation rate as the minimum
conditional entropy for a given key generation rate.

Abstract—We treat secret key extraction when the eavesdropper has correlated quantum states. We propose quantum privacy
ampliﬁcation theorems different from Renner’s, which are based
on quantum conditional R´ nyi entropy of order 1 + s. Using
e
those theorems, we derive an exponential decreasing rate for
leaked information and the asymptotic equivocation rate, which
have not been derived hitherto in the quantum setting.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Extracting secret random numbers in the presence of quantum attacker is one of important topics in quantum information
theory. The classical version of this topic was discussed by
[2], [6], [7], [9]. The quantum version is mainly treated by
Renner[8] and his collaborators with using universal2 hash
function. Indeed, a universal2 hash function can be implemented with small amount of calculation. As is shown by
Renner[8], when the classical random variable is correlated
with eavesdropper’s quantum state, applying a universal2 hash
function as a privacy ampliﬁcation process, we obtain a secret
random variable.
When the size of generated ﬁnal random variable is sufﬁciently small, the ﬁnal bits are almost independent of eavesdropper’s quantum state. Then, it is needed to evaluate the
leaked information of the protocol using a universal2 hash
function. In order to evaluate the secrecy, Renner[8] showed
a privacy ampliﬁcation theorem under the trace norm distance
with the conditional R´ nyi entropy of order 2. Combining this
e
theorem to the smoothing method, he provided the evaluation
for the secrecy of ﬁnal random variable.
In this paper, we propose a new security criterion for leaked
information and the difference from the uniform distribution
by modifying the quantum mutual information. Due to the
Pinsker inequality, the criterion bounds the universal composability. Using the conditional R´ nyi entropy of order 1 + s,
e
we propose other types of privacy ampliﬁcation theorems
under the above criterion. The fundamental theorem for this
purpose is derived by extending classical privacy ampliﬁcation
theorems obtained by [13], [14]. Using one of these theorems,
we derive an exponential decreasing rate of the criterion. That
is, when the extracted key rate is less than the conditional
entropy, the criterion goes to zero exponentially. Then, we

II. I NFORMATION QUANTITIES
In order to treat leaked information after universal2 privacy
ampliﬁcation in the quantum setting, we prepare several information quantities in a composite system Ha ⊗ HE , in which,
Ha is a classical system spanned by the basis {|a }. When the
composite state is ρ = a P (a)|a a| ⊗ ρa , the von Neumann
entropies and Renyi entropies are given as
H(A, E|ρ) := −Tr ρ log ρ
H(E|ρ) := −Tr ρE log ρE
−1
H1+s (A, E|ρ) :=
log Tr ρ1+s
s
−1
H1+s (E|ρ) :=
log Tr (ρE )1+s
s
with s ∈ R and ρE = Tr A ρ. When we focus on the total
system of a given density ρ, H(A, E|ρ) and H1+s (A, E|ρ)
are simpliﬁed to H(ρ) and H1+s (ρ).
Two kinds of quantum versions of the conditional entropy
and conditional Renyi entropy are given for s ∈ R:
H(A|E|ρ) := H(A, E|ρ) − H(E|ρ)
H(A|E|ρ) := −Tr ρ log(IA ⊗ (ρE )−1/2 ρIA ⊗ (ρE )−1/2 )

zero, the mutual information I(A : E|ρA,E ) goes to zero, and
the state ρA goes to the completely mixed state ρA . Hence,
mix
we can adopt the quantity I (A : E|ρA,E ) as a criterion for
qualifying the secret random number.
Using the trace norm, we can evaluate the secrecy for the
state ρ as follows:

The quantity H1+s (A|E|ρ) is used for the exponential decreasing rate for the security criterion in Section III while
∗
H 1+s (A|E|ρ) is used for our derivation of the equivocation
∗
rate in Section IV. Indeed, while the quantity H 2 (A|E|ρ) is
the same as the quantity H2 (A|E|ρ) given in [8] and the
∗
quantity H 2 (A|E|ρ) given in [11], the quantity H 1+s (A|E|ρ)
is different from the quantity H 1+s (A|E|ρ) given in [11] with
0 < s < 1.
Since the functions s → sH1+s (A|E|ρ) and
∗
s → sH 1+s (A|E|ρ) are concave and 0H1 (A|E|ρ) =

∗
H 1+s (A|E|ρ) ≥ Hmin (A|E|ρ). Since H2 (A|E|ρ) =
− log Tr ρ(ρ1/2 (IA ⊗ ρE )−1 ρ1/2 ), we have H1+s (A|E|ρ) ≥
H2 (A|E|ρ)
≥
− log (ρ1/2 (IA ⊗ ρE )−1 ρ1/2 )
=
− log IA ⊗ (ρE )−1/2 ρIA ⊗ (ρE )−1/2 = Hmin (A|E|ρ) for
s ∈ (0, 1]. Further, since lims→0 H1+s (A|E|ρ) = H(A|E|ρ)
∗
and lims→0 H 1+s (A|E|ρ) = H(A|E|ρ), we have
H(A|E|ρ) ≥ H1+s (A|E|ρ),

(24)

and

we obtain
D(ρ σ) ≤ D(Eσ (ρ) σ) + log v = D(Eσ (ρ) σ) + log v.
(25)

Indeed, the quantity I(A : E|ρA,E ) represents the amount
of information leaked to E, and the remaining quantity
D(ρA ρA ) describes the difference of the random number

A from the uniform random number. So, if the quantity I (A :
E|ρA,E ) is small, we can conclude that the random number A
has less correlation with E and is close to the uniform random
number. In particular, if the quantity I (A : E|ρA,E ) goes to

Therefore, when v is the number of the eigenvalues of Wp :=

III. E XPONENTIAL DECREASING RATE

⊗n

We consider the secure key extraction problem from a
common classical random number a ∈ A which has been
partially eavesdropped as quantum states by Eve. For this
problem, it is assumed that Alice and Bob share a common
classical random number a ∈ A, and Eve has a quantum state
ρa ∈ HE , which is correlated to the random number a. The
task is to extract a common random number f (a) from the
random number a ∈ A, which is almost independent of Eve’s
quantum state. Here, Alice and Bob are only allowed to apply
the same function f to the common random number a ∈ A.
Now, we focus on an ensemble of the functions fX from A to
{1, . . . , M }, where X denotes a random variable describing
the stochastic behavior of the function f . An ensemble of the
functions fX is called universal2 when it satisﬁes the following
condition[4]:
Condition 1: ∀a1 = ∀a2 ∈ A, the probability that
1
fX (a1 ) = fX (a2 ) is at most M .
Indeed, when the cardinality |A| is a power of a prime power
q and M is another power of the same prime power q, an
ensemble {fX } satisfying the both conditions is given by the
the concatenation of Toeplitz matrix and the identity (X, I)[5]
only with logq |A| − 1 random variables taking values in the
ﬁnite ﬁled Fq . That is, the matrix (X, I) has small complexity.
Theorem 1: When the ensemble of the functions {fX } is
universal2 , it satisﬁes

H1+s (A|E|ρ)) > 0. Thus, the right hand side of (29) goes to
zero exponentially. Conversely, due to (17), any sequence of
functions fn : An → {1, . . . , enR } satisﬁes that

We have derived a lower upper bound of the exponential
decreasing rate for information leaked to quantum attacker
in the modiﬁed quantum mutual information criterion when
we apply universal2 hash functions. In the commutative case,
our lower bound coincides with that given in [13]. which
is different from Renner[8]’s two universal hashing lemma.
Further, we have derived asymptotic equivocation rate. These
results have been obtained by using quantum version of
privacy ampliﬁcation theorems by [13], [14].
